RESULTS   O
:   O
Sirt1   O

response   O
to   O
the   O
TNFalpha   O
treatment   O
.   O
Additionally   O
,   O

,   O
and   O
these   O

were   O
reversed   O
by   O
the   O

At   O
the   O

Furthermore   O
,   O
Sirt1   O
modulated   O

by   O
activating   O
the   O
MAPK-ERK-Mfn2   O

BACKGROUND   O
:   O
Costunolide   O
(COS)   O

known   O
to   O
exert   O
anti-inflammatory   O

anticancer   O
effects   O
.   O
This   O

was   O
undertaken   O
to   O

RESULTS   O
:   O
Costunolide   O
significantly   O
promoted   O
the   O
proliferation   O
of   O
hHFDPCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
which   O
is   O
comparable   O
to   O
that   O
of   O

COS   O
also   O
inhibited   O
the   O
5alpha-reductase   O

in   O
hHFDPCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

CONCLUSIONS   O
:   O
Our   O

illustrate   O
that   O
COS   O
promotes   O

.   O
Appropriate   O

relies   O
on   O
the   O

How   O
immune   O

is   O
not   O
well   O
understood   O
.   O
We   O
took   O
advantage   O
of   O
wound-induced   O
hair   O
growth   O
(WIHG)   O
to   O
explore   O
the   O
relationship   O
between   O
wound   O
macrophages   O
and   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME

.   O
First   O
,   O
we   O
showed   O
that   O
WIHG   O
is   O
dependent   O
on   O
CD11b+F4/80+   O
macrophages   O
at   O
7-11   O
days   O
after   O
injury   O
.   O
Next   O
,   O
using   O
CX3CR1gfp/+:CCR2rfp/+   O
mice   O
to   O
capture   O
the   O
dynamic   O
spectrum   O
of   O
macrophage   O
phenotypes   O
during   O
wound   O
healing   O
,   O
we   O
showed   O
that   O
wound   O
macrophages   O
transition   O
from   O
a   O
CX3CR1lo/med   O
to   O
a   O
CX3CR1hi   O
phenotype   O
at   O
the   O
onset   O
of   O
WIHG   O
.   O
Finally   O
,   O
WIHG   O
is   O
abolished   O
in   O
mice   O
deficient   O
for   O
CX3CR1   O
,   O
delayed   O
with   O
pharmacological   O
inhibition   O
of   O

1   O
,   O
and   O
rescued   O
with   O
exogenous   O
transforming   O
growth   O
factor-beta1   O
.   O
Overall   O
,   O
we   O
propose   O
a   O
model   O
in   O
which   O
transforming   O
growth   O
factor-beta1   O
and   O
CX3CR1   O
are   O
critical   O
for   O
recruiting   O
and   O

in   O
the   O
early   O
to   O

.   O
This   O
led   O
to   O
subsequent   O
methods   O
describing   O
the   O
isolation   O
and   O
culture   O
of   O

The   O
importance   O
of   O
these   O
models   O
in   O
the   O
study   O
of   O
the   O
biology   O
of   O
human   O
skin   O
glands   O
and   O
appendages   O
has   O
been   O
demonstrated   O
in   O
numerous   O
publications   O
and   O
their   O
importance   O
as   O
models   O
for   O
animal   O
replacement   O
,   O
refinement   O
and   O
reduction   O
(3Rs)   O
is   O
increasingly   O
important   O
.   O
In   O
particular   O
,   O
in   O
vitro   O
(ex   O
vivo)   O
hair   O
follicle   O
culture   O
has   O
played   O
a   O
significant   O
part   O
in   O
helping   O
elucidate   O
the   O
role   O
of   O
signalling   O
molecules   O
in   O
regulating   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
growth   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
and   O
hair   O
fibre   O
formation   O
and   O
has   O
been   O
especially   O
useful   O
in   O
understanding   O
metabolic   O
aspects   O
of   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
growth   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
However   O
,   O
obtaining   O
sufficient   O
numbers   O
of   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
is   O
becoming   O
increasingly   O
difficult   O
as   O
plastic   O
surgery   O
becomes   O
less   O
invasive   O
and   O
smaller   O
skin   O
samples   O
provided   O
.   O
There   O
is   O
therefore   O
an   O
urgent   O
requirement   O
for   O
the   O

According   O
to   O
recent   O
evidence   O
(in   O
contrast   O
to   O
previous   O
bulge-centric   O
views)   O
,   O
the   O
SHG   O
is   O
the   O
primary   O
target   O
of   O
anagen-inducing   O
signalling   O
and   O

The   O
SHG   O
is   O
comprised   O
of   O
two   O
functionally   O
distinct   O
cell   O

forms   O

,   O
while   O
the   O

SHG   O
(formed   O
by   O

builds   O
up   O

The   O
predetermination   O
of   O
SHG   O
cells   O
to   O
a   O

morphogenetic   O
fate   O
contradicts   O
their   O
attribution   O
to   O
the   O
"stem   O
cell"   O
category   O
and   O
supports   O
SHG   O
designation   O
as   O
a   O
"germinative"   O
or   O
a   O
"founder"   O

remain   O
unknown   O
.   O
Functionally   O
,   O
the   O
SHG   O
serves   O
as   O
a   O
barrier   O
,   O
protecting   O
the   O
quiescent   O

cell   O
niche   O
from   O
the   O
extensive   O

milieu   O
.   O
The   O
formation   O
of   O
the   O

is   O
a   O
prerequisite   O
for   O
efficient   O
"precommitment"   O
of   O

for   O
easier   O

.   O
In   O
general   O
,   O
the   O
formation   O
of   O
the   O
SHG   O
is   O
an   O
evolutionary   O
adaptation   O
,   O
which   O
allowed   O

Results   O
of   O
the   O

showed   O
that   O

In   O
addition   O
,   O
DNA   O

increased   O
with   O
the   O

In   O
conclusion   O
,   O
RFR   O
emitted   O

Researchers   O
have   O

could   O
indeed   O
inhibit   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

but   O
the   O
relationship   O
between   O

remains   O
unknown   O
.   O
In   O

We   O
found   O
that   O

The   O
alterations   O
of   O

might   O
be   O
a   O

Moreover   O
,   O

BACKGROUND   O
:   O
The   O
method   O
of   O
generating   O
bioengineered   O
skin   O
constructs   O
was   O
pioneered   O
several   O
decades   O
ago;   O
nowadays   O
these   O
constructs   O
are   O
used   O
regularly   O
for   O
the   O
treatment   O
of   O
severe   O
burns   O
and   O
nonhealing   O
wounds   O
.   O
Commonly   O
,   O
these   O
constructs   O
are   O
comprised   O
of   O
skin   O
fibroblasts   O
within   O
a   O
collagen   O
scaffold   O
,   O
forming   O
the   O
skin   O
dermis   O
,   O
and   O
stratified   O
keratinocytes   O
overlying   O
this   O
,   O
forming   O
the   O
skin   O
epidermis   O
.   O
In   O
the   O
past   O
decade   O
there   O
has   O
been   O
a   O
surge   O
of   O
interest   O
in   O
bioengineered   O
skins   O
,   O
with   O
researchers   O
seeking   O
alternative   O
cell   O
sources   O
,   O
or   O
scaffolds   O
,   O
from   O
which   O
constructs   O
can   O
be   O
established   O
,   O
and   O
for   O
more   O
biomimetic   O
equivalents   O
with   O

OBJECTIVES   O
:   O
To   O
evaluate   O
whether   O
human   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

cells   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
can   O
act   O
as   O
an   O

source   O
for   O
engineering   O
the   O
dermal   O
component   O
of   O
engineered   O

constructs   O
.   O
METHODS   O
:   O
We   O
established   O
in   O

skin   O
constructs   O
by   O
incorporating   O
into   O
the   O
collagenous   O

were   O
established   O
by   O
mixing   O
dermal   O

and   O
keratinocytes   O
in   O
chambers   O
on   O
top   O
of   O
immunologically   O
compromised   O
mice   O
.   O
RESULTS   O
:   O
All   O
fibroblast   O
subtypes   O
were   O
capable   O
of   O
supporting   O
growth   O
of   O
overlying   O

,   O
both   O
in   O

This   O

remains   O
unclear   O
.   O
We   O
found   O
that   O
STAT3   O

in   O
keratinocytes   O
is   O
required   O
to   O
maintain   O
skin   O

by   O
negatively   O
controlling   O
the   O
expression   O
of   O
hair   O

keratin   O
genes   O
.   O
These   O
expression   O
patterns   O
correlated   O
with   O
the   O
onset   O
of   O
dermatitis   O
,   O
which   O
was   O
observed   O
in   O
specific   O
pathogen-free   O
conditions   O

not   O
in   O
germ-free   O

suggesting   O
the   O
involvement   O

responses   O
.   O
Thus   O
,   O
our   O
study   O

that   O
STAT3-dependent   O
gene   O
expression   O
in   O

plays   O
a   O

Specifically   O
,   O
we   O

that   O

then   O

enhance   O

Here   O
we   O
delineate   O
how   O
to   O
experimentally   O

this   O

oxidative   O
stress   O
sensing   O
appears   O
to   O
be   O
a   O
key   O
factor   O
involved   O
.   O
In   O
this   O
study   O
,   O
we   O
examined   O
the   O
follicular   O
melanin   O
unit   O
in   O
variably   O

from   O
the   O

of   O
healthy   O
individuals   O
(22-70   O

.   O
Over   O
20   O
markers   O
were   O
selected   O
within   O
the   O
following   O
categories   O
:   O
melanocyte-specific   O
,   O

As   O
expected   O
,   O
a   O

in   O
proportion   O
to   O
the   O
extent   O
of   O

was   O
observed   O
.   O
A   O
major   O
finding   O
of   O
our   O
study   O
was   O
the   O
intense   O
and   O
highly   O

of   O

ATM   O
is   O
a   O
serine/threonine   O
protein   O
kinase   O
that   O
is   O
recruited   O
and   O
activated   O
by   O
DNA   O
double-strand   O

and   O
functions   O
as   O
an   O
important   O
sensor   O
of   O
reactive   O
oxygen   O
species   O
(ROS)   O
in   O
human   O
cells   O
.   O
The   O
incidence   O
and   O
expression   O
level   O
of   O
ATM   O
correlated   O
with   O
pigmentary   O
status   O
in   O
canities-affected   O

follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
Moreover   O
,   O
increased   O
staining   O
of   O
the   O
redox-associated   O
markers   O
8-OHdG   O
,   O
GADD45   O
and   O
GP-1   O
were   O
also   O
detected   O
within   O
isolated   O
bulbar   O
melanocytes   O
,   O
although   O
this   O
change   O
was   O
not   O
clearly   O
associated   O
with   O
donor   O
age   O
or   O
canities   O
extent   O
.   O
Surprisingly   O
,   O
we   O
were   O
unable   O
to   O
detect   O
any   O
specific   O
change   O
in   O
the   O
expression   O
of   O
other   O
markers   O

in   O
the   O
canities-affected   O

to   O
surrounding   O

.   O
By   O
contrast   O
,   O
several   O
markers   O
showed   O
distinct   O
expression   O
of   O
markers   O
for   O
oxidative   O
stress   O
and   O
apoptosis/differentiation   O
in   O
the   O
inner   O

in   O

model   O
of   O
primary   O
human   O
scalp   O
hair   O
follicle   O
melanocytes   O
,   O
we   O
showed   O
that   O
ATM   O
expression   O
increased   O
after   O
incubation   O
with   O
the   O
pro-oxidant   O
hydrogen   O
peroxide   O
(H2O2)   O
.   O
In   O
addition   O
,   O
this   O
ATM   O
increase   O
was   O
prevented   O
by   O
pre-incubation   O
of   O
cells   O
with   O
antioxidants   O
.   O
The   O
relationship   O
between   O
ATM   O
and   O
redox   O
stress   O
sensing   O
was   O
further   O
evidenced   O
as   O
we   O
observed   O
that   O
the   O
inhibition   O
of   O
ATM   O
expression   O
by   O
chemical   O
inhibition   O
promoted   O
the   O
loss   O
of   O
melanocyte   O
viability   O
induced   O
by   O
oxidative   O
stress   O
.   O
Taken   O
together   O
these   O
new   O
findings   O
illustrate   O
the   O
key   O
role   O
of   O
ATM   O
in   O
the   O
protection   O
of   O

In   O
conclusion   O
,   O
these   O
results   O
highlight   O
the   O
remarkable   O
complexity   O
and   O
role   O
of   O

a   O
size   O
of   O
about   O
300   O

as   O
well   O
as   O
the   O
passive   O
,   O

penetration   O
,   O
was   O
assessed   O
on   O
the   O
ex-vivo   O
pig   O

.   O
Nanocrystals   O
were   O
efficiently   O
taken   O
up   O
by   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
and   O
reached   O
the   O
lower   O
part   O
of   O
the   O
infundibulum   O
.   O
This   O
region   O
is   O
optimal   O
for   O
efficient   O
drug   O
delivery   O
because   O
the   O
barrier   O
of   O
the   O
lower   O
infundibulum   O
is   O
not   O
fully   O
developed   O
and   O
thus   O
more   O
permeable   O
,   O
which   O
results   O
in   O
a   O
less   O
hindered   O
passive   O
diffusion   O
of   O

substances   O
.   O
The   O
penetration   O
efficacy   O
of   O
the   O
nanocrystals   O
into   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
was   O
not   O
affected   O
by   O
the   O
different   O
types   O
of   O
vehicles   O
,   O
which   O
represented   O
either   O
oleogels   O
or   O
hydrogels   O
that   O
varied   O
in   O
viscosity   O
as   O
well   O
as   O
in   O
the   O
type   O
and   O
the   O
concentration   O
of   O
the   O
gelling   O
agent   O
.   O
All   O
gels   O
possessed   O
a   O
shear-thinning   O
flow   O
behavior   O
and   O
it   O
is   O
hypothesized   O
that   O
all   O
gels   O
fluidized   O
during   O
the   O
skin   O
massage   O
,   O
whereby   O
leading   O
to   O
similarly   O
low   O
viscosities   O
than   O
the   O
aqueous   O
nanosuspension   O
and   O
thus   O
to   O
similar   O
penetration   O
results   O
.   O
The   O
passive   O
,   O
dermal   O
penetration   O
of   O
curcumin   O
was   O
different   O
for   O
the   O
different   O
gels   O
and   O
the   O
main   O
driving   O
parameter   O
leading   O
to   O
good   O
passive   O
diffusion   O
was   O
caused   O
by   O
good   O
skin   O
hydrating   O
properties   O
of   O
the   O
vehicle   O
.   O
The   O
best   O
passive   O
penetration   O
was   O
achieved   O
from   O
hydrogels   O
that   O
contained   O
a   O
humectant   O
.   O
However   O
,   O
the   O
addition   O
of   O
the   O
humectant   O
reduced   O
the   O
efficacy   O
of   O
the   O
nanocrystals   O
to   O
penetrate   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
Data   O
so   O
far   O
,   O
therefore   O
,   O
suggest   O
that   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
targeting   O
with   O
nanocrystals   O
that   O
are   O
suspended   O
in   O
water   O
or   O
simple   O
,   O
shear-thinning   O
gels   O
is   O
highly   O
effective   O
.   O
However   O
,   O
the   O
addition   O
of   O
other   O
excipients   O
,   O
e.g   O
.   O
humectants   O
,   O
to   O
these   O
vehicles   O
might   O
cause   O
changes   O
in   O
the   O
penetration   O
profiles   O
.   O
More   O

The   O

Nuclei   O
of   O

both   O
K14-positive   O
outer   O
root   O
sheath   O
cells   O
and   O
in   O
involucrin-positive   O

were   O
significantly   O
compressed   O

whereas   O
the   O
response   O
in   O
the   O
infundibulum   O
and   O
suprabulbar   O
regions   O
was   O
more   O
variable   O
.   O
The   O

the   O

not   O

.   O
The   O
changes   O
in   O
the   O
collagenous   O

were   O
distinct   O
at   O
different   O
depths   O
of   O
the   O

body   O
.   O
They   O
represent   O
a   O
promising   O
future   O
for   O
regenerative   O
medicine   O
because   O
of   O
their   O
multiple   O
advantages   O

Wound   O
healing   O
is   O
a   O
natural   O
process   O
to   O
restore   O
the   O
structure   O

diseased   O
tissues   O
.   O
Repair   O
of   O
a   O
skin   O
wound   O
usually   O
leads   O
to   O
a   O
scar   O
while   O
regeneration   O
implies   O
fully   O
recovery   O
of   O
function   O
and   O
structure   O
of   O
the   O
damaged   O
tissue   O
.   O
Adult   O
skin   O
wound   O
usually   O
heals   O

We   O
reported   O
an   O
80-year-old   O
patient   O
with   O
a   O
large   O

.   O
The   O
patient's   O
wound   O
healed   O
very   O
well   O
aesthetically   O
.   O
Interestingly   O
,   O
on   O
approximate   O
post   O
wound   O
day   O
180   O
,   O
a   O
hair   O
was   O
observed   O
to   O
be   O
growing   O
towards   O
the   O
surface   O
and   O
eventually   O
erupted   O
in   O
the   O

the   O
wound   O
.   O
The   O
hair   O
remained   O
black   O
at   O
42-month   O
follow-up   O
.   O
This   O
case   O
demonstrated   O
that   O
neogenesis   O
of   O
hair   O
is   O
possible   O
even   O
in   O
geriatric   O
patient   O

Here   O
we   O
provide   O
a   O

demonstrate   O
how   O
several   O
important   O
differences   O
in   O

could   O
account   O
for   O
these   O

We   O
trace   O
this   O

Finally   O
,   O
we   O
show   O
that   O

Taken   O
together   O

we   O
note   O
that   O

not   O

which   O
likely   O
explains   O
why   O
the   O

was   O
severely   O

by   O

rather   O
than   O
being   O

We   O
speculate   O
that   O
blockade   O
of   O
the   O

is   O
a   O

may   O
provide   O

The   O

similar   O
.   O
The   O

can   O
manifest   O
with   O

OBJECTIVES   O
:   O
To   O
explore   O
the   O
hypothesis   O
that   O
,   O
besides   O
apoptosis   O
,   O
eHFSCs   O
undergo   O
pathological   O
epithelial-mesenchymal   O
transition   O
(EMT)   O
in   O
pCIA   O
,   O
thus   O
explaining   O
the   O
scarring   O
phenotype   O
.   O
Furthermore   O
,   O
we   O
tested   O
whether   O
a   O
peroxisome   O
proliferator-activated   O
receptor   O
(PPAR)-gamma   O
modulator   O
could   O
prevent   O
pCIA-associated   O
pathomechanisms   O
.   O
METHODS   O
:   O
Organ-cultured   O
human   O
scalp   O
HFs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
were   O
treated   O
with   O
the   O
cyclophosphamide   O
metabolite   O
4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide   O
(4-HC)   O
.   O
Additionally   O
,   O
HFs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
were   O
pretreated   O
with   O
the   O
agonistic   O
PPAR-gamma   O
modulator   O
N-acetyl-GED-0507-34-Levo   O
(NAGED)   O
,   O
which   O
has   O
previously   O
been   O
shown   O
to   O
promote   O
K15   O
expression   O
and   O
antagonize   O
EMT   O
in   O
eHFSCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
RESULTS   O
:   O
In   O

with   O
anticipated   O
hair   O

,   O
dystrophy   O
and   O
catagen   O
induction   O
,   O

promoted   O
apoptosis   O

with   O
increased   O
p53   O

evidenced   O
by   O

CONCLUSIONS   O
:   O
Since   O
a   O
key   O
cyclophosphamide   O
metabolite   O
alone   O
suffices   O
to   O
damage   O
and   O
deplete   O

ABSTRACT   O
:   O
Nonthermal   O
atmospheric   O
pressure   O
(NAP)   O
plasmas   O
have   O
recently   O
been   O
developed   O
and   O
have   O
been   O
used   O
for   O
wound   O
healing   O
,   O
blood   O
coagulation   O
,   O
and   O
cancer   O
therapy   O
.   O
NAP   O
plasmas   O
can   O
induce   O
either   O
cell   O
proliferation   O
or   O
cell   O
death   O
,   O
depending   O
on   O
the   O
dose   O
.   O
Due   O
to   O
their   O
efficacy   O
and   O
application   O
easily   O
,   O
plasma   O
activated   O
mediums   O
(PAMs)   O
have   O
been   O
used   O
in   O
human   O
cells   O
recently.In   O
atmosphere   O
,   O
NAP   O
plasmas   O
react   O
with   O
molecular   O
content   O
of   O
air   O
such   O
as   O
N2   O
,   O
O2   O
,   O
H2O   O
vapor   O
,   O
etc   O
,   O
and   O
generate   O
a   O
variety   O
of   O
reactive   O
oxygen   O
and   O
nitrogen   O
species   O
.   O
High   O
reactive   O
oxygen   O
species   O
(ROS)   O
levels   O
promote   O
damage   O
of   O
cellular   O
DNA   O
,   O
proteins   O
,   O
and   O
lipids   O
.   O
Such   O
damage   O
can   O
lead   O
to   O
cell-cycle   O
arrest   O
,   O
and   O
cellular   O
death   O
.   O
However   O
,   O
low   O
levels   O
of   O
ROS   O
have   O
been   O
caused   O
an   O
increase   O
in   O
cell   O

progression.Human   O
skin   O
is   O
arranged   O
in   O
3   O
layers   O
,   O
including   O
(from   O
top   O
to   O
bottom)   O
the   O
epidermis   O
(and   O
its   O
appendages)   O
,   O
the   O
dermis   O
,   O
and   O
the   O
hypodermis   O
.   O
Human   O

(DPCs)   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
are   O
located   O
in   O
the   O
middle   O
or   O
even   O
deep   O
part   O
of   O
the   O
dermis   O
.   O
DPCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
play   O
a   O
key   O
role   O
in   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
regeneration   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
and   O
a   O
lot   O
of   O
effort   O
have   O
been   O
made   O
to   O
promote   O
DPC   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

ability   O
.   O
DPC   O
is   O
increased   O
proliferation   O
,   O
delayed   O
senescence   O
,   O
and   O
enhanced   O
hair   O
by   O
depending   O
on   O
the   O
amount   O
of   O
ROS   O
through   O
the   O
NAP-PAM   O
treatment.In   O
this   O
study   O
,   O
we   O
used   O
NAP   O
plasmas   O
to   O
the   O
human   O

DPCs   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
exposed   O
from   O
0   O
to   O
20   O
minutes   O
,   O
so   O
we   O
were   O
investigated   O
the   O
effects   O
of   O
PAM   O
on   O
cell   O
proliferation   O
and   O
cell   O
cycle   O
progression   O
.   O
After   O
NAP-PAM   O
treatment   O
for   O
24   O
hours   O
,   O
cell   O
cycle   O
was   O
arrested   O
in   O
the   O
G0/G1   O
phase   O
.   O
The   O
NAP-PAM-treated   O
human   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
DPCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
recovered   O
gradually   O
after   O
48   O
hours   O
of   O
the   O
treatment   O
compared   O
to   O
the   O
untreated   O
cells.Therefore   O
,   O
this   O
approach   O
offers   O
promising   O
results   O
for   O
further   O
application   O
of   O
NAP-PAM   O
in   O
clinical   O
dermatology   O
.   O
In   O
future   O
,   O
it   O
can   O
be   O
applied   O
clinically   O
in   O
the   O
form   O
of   O
active   O
water   O
that   O
can   O
delay   O
the   O
progression   O
of   O

Data   O
analysis   O
showed   O
that   O
upregulated   O

experience   O
several   O
changes   O
with   O
aging   O
,   O
the   O
most   O
noticeable   O
of   O
which   O
is   O
graying   O
of   O
the   O
hair   O
shaft   O
due   O

Additional   O
changes   O
in   O
the   O
diameter   O

however   O

the   O
function   O
of   O
NNAT   O
is   O
still   O
unclear   O

Recent   O

NNAT   O
is   O
widely   O
localized   O
in   O
subcellular   O

excluding   O
the   O

,   O
we   O
further   O
evaluated   O
NNAT-positive   O

Immunohistochemistry   O
revealed   O
that   O

In   O

exhibited   O
novel   O
intracellular   O
localization   O
in   O

The   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
is   O
a   O
biological   O
oscillator   O
that   O
alternates   O
growth   O
,   O
regression   O
,   O
and   O
rest   O
phases   O
driven   O
by   O

and   O
subsequent   O

is   O
mainly   O

by   O
Wnt/beta-catenin   O

while   O
regression   O
and   O
resting   O
phases   O
are   O
mainly   O
regulated   O
by   O
Tgf-beta/Bmp/Smad   O
activity   O
.   O
A   O
major   O
question   O
still   O
unresolved   O
is   O
the   O
nature   O
of   O
the   O
molecular   O
switch   O
that   O
dictates   O
the   O
coordinated   O
transition   O
between   O
both   O

pathways   O
.   O
Here   O
we   O
have   O
focused   O
on   O
the   O
role   O
of   O
Endoglin   O
(Eng)   O
,   O
a   O
key   O
co-receptor   O
for   O
members   O
of   O
the   O
Tgf-beta/Bmp   O
family   O
of   O
growth   O
factors   O
.   O
Using   O
an   O
Eng   O
haploinsufficient   O
mouse   O
model   O
,   O
we   O
report   O
that   O
Eng   O
is   O
required   O
to   O
maintain   O
a   O
correct   O
follicle   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
stem   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
cell   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
niches   O
.   O
We   O
further   O
report   O
that   O
beta-catenin   O
binds   O
to   O
the   O
Eng   O
promoter   O
depending   O
on   O
Bmp   O
signalling   O
.   O
Moreover   O
,   O
we   O
show   O
that   O
beta-catenin   O
interacts   O
with   O
Smad4   O
in   O
a   O
Bmp/Eng-dependent   O
context   O
and   O
both   O
proteins   O
act   O
synergistically   O
to   O
activate   O
Eng   O
promoter   O
transcription   O
.   O
These   O
observations   O
point   O
to   O
the   O
existence   O
of   O
a   O
growth/rest   O
switching   O
mechanism   O
in   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

,   O
the   O
effect   O
of   O
icariin   O
on   O

CONCLUSIONS   O
:   O
These   O

Type   O
2   O
Diabetes   O

(DM2)   O
includes   O
a   O

of   O
metabolic   O

characterized   O
by   O

that   O
causes   O
several   O

The   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

could   O
reveal   O
signs   O
of   O

its   O
relationship   O
to   O
early   O
metabolic   O
injuries   O
has   O
been   O
largely   O
ignored   O
.   O
We   O
propose   O
that   O
in   O
earlier   O
stages   O
of   O
the   O
continuum   O
of   O
DM2-related   O
metabolic   O
disorders   O
,   O

the   O

criteria   O
to   O
be   O
considered   O
as   O

end   O

,   O
including   O

damage   O
,   O
which   O
can   O
be   O
evaluated   O
to   O
identify   O
an   O
early   O
risk   O
marker   O
.   O
This   O
hypothesis   O
is   O
based   O
in   O
the   O
association   O
found   O
between   O
insulin   O
resistance   O
and   O
alopecia   O
in   O
non-diabetic   O
persons   O
,   O
and   O
the   O
hair   O
loss   O
on   O
the   O
lower   O
limbs   O
as   O
a   O
manifestation   O
of   O
long-term   O
peripheral   O
arterial   O
disease   O
among   O
subjects   O
with   O
DM2   O
.   O
In   O
order   O
to   O
test   O
this   O
hypothesis   O
,   O
studies   O
are   O
required   O
to   O
evaluate   O
if   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

characteristics   O
are   O
related   O
to   O
and   O
can   O
predict   O
hyperglycemic   O
complications   O
,   O
and   O
if   O
they   O
do   O
so   O
,   O
which   O
feature   O
of   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
such   O
as   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
growth   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
best   O
characterizes   O
such   O
DM2-related   O
conditions   O
.   O
If   O
this   O
hypothesis   O
were   O
proven   O
to   O
be   O
true   O
,   O
significant   O
advances   O
towards   O
a   O
personalized   O
approach   O
for   O
early   O
prevention   O
strategies   O
and   O
management   O
of   O
DM2   O
would   O
be   O
made   O
.   O
By   O
focusing   O
on   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
early   O
stages   O
of   O
metabolic-related   O
organ   O
damage   O
could   O
be   O
identified   O
using   O
non-invasive   O
low-cost   O
techniques   O
.   O
In   O
so   O
doing   O
,   O
this   O
approach   O
could   O
provide   O
early   O
identification   O
of   O
DM2-susceptible   O
individuals   O
and   O
lead   O
to   O
the   O
early   O
initiation   O
of   O

Here   O

we   O
determined   O

found   O
that   O
beta-catenin   O

was   O
suppressed   O
by   O

We   O
then   O

it   O

Here   O
we   O

how   O

affects   O

whether   O
the   O

Our   O
results   O
show   O
that   O

application   O
at   O
mid   O

late   O
telogen   O

whereas   O
the   O

decreased   O

Interestingly   O
,   O
high   O

reduced   O
.   O
This   O
could   O
be   O
rescued   O
after   O

suggesting   O
that   O

The   O

of   O
the   O
anagen-inhibiting   O
factor   O
BMP-4   O
was   O
reduced   O
by   O
IMQ   O
treatment   O
as   O
well   O
as   O
the   O

On   O

By   O
means   O
of   O

Using   O

we   O
demonstrate   O
that   O
this   O

First   O
,   O
we   O
sought   O
to   O

We   O
also   O

This   O
analysis   O
revealed   O
that   O
RBM28   O
controls   O
the   O

Several   O

been   O
established;   O

METHODS   O
:   O
We   O
designed   O
an   O
improved   O
flap   O
model   O
(IFM)   O
for   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

based   O
on   O
the   O
existing   O
flap   O
assay   O
.   O
Histological   O
sections   O

were   O
used   O
to   O
evaluate   O
the   O

The   O
fates   O
of   O

RESULTS   O
:   O
IFM   O
produced   O
a   O

and   O
the   O
time   O

CONCLUSIONS   O
:   O
The   O

required   O
for   O

is   O
considerably   O
shortened   O
with   O

.   O
We   O
speculate   O
that   O
this   O
is   O
due   O
to   O
increased   O
blood   O

at   O
the   O

Clinicians   O

long   O

In   O

how   O
the   O
anagen   O

its   O

remains   O
elusive   O

Here   O
,   O
we   O
showed   O
that   O

,   O
the   O
hair   O

types   O
(Guard   O

Awl   O
,   O
Auchene   O
and   O
Zigzag)   O
was   O
unaffected   O
.   O
Interestingly   O
,   O
we   O
found   O
that   O
the   O
effect   O
of   O
exogenous   O
WNT10b   O
was   O
mainly   O
on   O
Zigzag   O
and   O
less   O
on   O
the   O
other   O
kinds   O
of   O

We   O
observed   O
dramatically   O

Ectopic   O
expression   O
of   O
CD34   O
throughout   O
the   O
ORS   O

was   O
also   O
observed   O
.   O
Many   O
CD34-positive   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

were   O
actively   O
proliferating   O
in   O
AdWnt10b-induced   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

Importantly   O
,   O
subsequent   O
co-treatment   O
with   O
the   O
Wnt   O
inhibitor   O
,   O
DKK1   O
,   O
reduced   O

.   O
Moreover   O
,   O
injection   O
of   O

Together   O
,   O
these   O

Our   O
previous   O

demonstrated   O
that   O
HTATIP2   O
may   O
participate   O
in   O
regulating   O
rabbit   O

cycles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
but   O
the   O
molecular   O
mechanism   O
of   O
HTATIP2   O
remained   O
unclear   O
.   O
In   O
this   O
study   O
,   O
the   O
coding   O
sequence   O
of   O
the   O
HTATIP2   O
gene   O
in   O
Angora   O

was   O
cloned   O
.   O
The   O
length   O
of   O
the   O
coding   O
region   O
sequence   O
was   O
840   O
bp   O
,   O
which   O
could   O
code   O
279   O
amino   O

,   O
and   O
exhibited   O
high   O
homology   O
in   O
different   O
mammals   O
.   O
Bioinformatics   O
analyses   O
indicated   O
that   O
the   O
HTATIP2   O
protein   O
is   O
stable   O
,   O
hydrophilic   O
,   O
located   O
around   O
the   O
cytoplasm   O
,   O
and   O
has   O
a   O
putative   O

peptide   O
.   O
Moreover   O
,   O
we   O
verified   O
that   O
HTATIP2   O
is   O
highly   O
expressed   O
during   O
catagen   O
and   O
telogen   O
of   O
the   O

.   O
The   O
overexpression   O

was   O
constructed   O

siRNAs   O
were   O
designed   O
.   O
Overexpression   O
and   O

appeared   O
to   O

,   O
and   O

.   O
It   O
is   O
therefore   O
likely   O
that   O
HTATIP2   O
promotes   O
cell   O
apoptosis   O
and   O
inhibits   O
cell   O
proliferation   O
.   O
Our   O

indicate   O
that   O
HTATIP2   O
is   O
highly   O

FINDINGS   O
:   O
Our   O
study   O
demonstrates   O
that   O
sPLA2-IIA   O
induces   O
rapid   O
proliferation   O
of   O
HFSCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
thereby   O
altering   O
the   O
proliferation   O
dynamics   O
leading   O
to   O
a   O

.   O
In   O
a   O

we   O
showed   O

INTERPRETATION   O
:   O
This   O
study   O
unravels   O
how   O
an   O
increased   O
proliferation   O
induced   O
by   O
a   O
common   O

inducer   O
(sPLA2-IIA)   O

SCs   O
and   O
cancer   O
cells   O
distinctively   O
through   O
common   O
JNK/c-Jun   O
signalling   O
.   O
Thus   O
,   O
sPLA2-IIA   O
can   O
be   O
a   O
potential   O
target   O
for   O
various   O

Mutations   O
associated   O

the   O

To   O
address   O
this   O
,   O
we   O
targeted   O
an   O

to   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

are   O
integrated   O

Follicular   O
Hras   O
mutant   O
cells   O
autonomously   O
and   O
nonautonomously   O
enhance   O
regeneration   O
,   O
which   O
directs   O
mutant   O
cells   O
into   O
continuous   O
tissue   O
cycling   O
to   O
promote   O
integration   O
rather   O
than   O
aberrancy   O
.   O
This   O
follicular   O
tolerance   O
is   O
maintained   O
under   O
additional   O
challenges   O
that   O
promote   O
tumorigenesis   O
in   O
the   O
epidermis   O
,   O
including   O
aging   O
,   O
injury   O
,   O
and   O
a   O
secondary   O

.   O
Thus   O
,   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

possesses   O
a   O
unique   O
,   O
enhanced   O
capacity   O
to   O
integrate   O

Hras   O

cells   O
within   O
both   O
homeostatic   O

,   O
demonstrating   O
that   O
in   O
the   O

exist   O

The   O
maintenance   O
of   O

is   O
critical   O
for   O
stem   O

to   O

Here   O
,   O
we   O
establish   O
a   O

We   O
uncover   O
the   O

after   O

and   O
then   O
undergo   O
large-scale   O

.   O
HFSC   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
proliferation   O
is   O
activated   O
through   O

the   O
properties   O
of   O

in   O
the   O

despite   O
its   O
relatively   O
distant   O
location   O
.   O
The   O
DP   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
induces   O
regeneration   O
by   O
downregulating   O

effects   O
that   O

Once   O
regeneration   O
initiates   O
,   O
the   O
DP   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
orchestrates   O
Shh   O
expression   O
in   O
primed-progenitor   O
descendants   O
by   O
an   O
autoregulatory   O
circuit   O
to   O
restrict   O
Shh   O
expression   O
to   O
the   O

and   O
to   O
confine   O
Shh   O
levels   O
to   O
act   O
only   O
on   O
nearby   O
cells   O
.   O
As   O
the   O
DP   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
moves   O
away   O
from   O
the   O
bulge   O
,   O
quiescent   O
SCs   O
are   O
exposed   O
to   O
Shh   O
transiently   O
.   O
This   O
ensures   O
a   O
short   O
period   O
of   O
quiescent   O
SC   O
activation   O
required   O
for   O
normal   O

Vitiligo   O

in   O
which   O
the   O

during   O
a   O

The   O
quiescence   O
of   O

is   O
known   O
to   O
be   O
regulated   O
by   O
a   O
number   O
of   O
intrinsic   O

extrinsic   O
mechanisms   O
.   O
Here   O
we   O
provide   O
several   O
lines   O
of   O
evidence   O
to   O
demonstrate   O
that   O
HFSCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
utilize   O
glycolytic   O
metabolism   O
and   O
produce   O
significantly   O
more   O
lactate   O
than   O
other   O
cells   O
in   O
the   O
epidermis   O
.   O
Furthermore   O
,   O
lactate   O
generation   O
appears   O
to   O
be   O
critical   O
for   O
the   O
activation   O
of   O
HFSCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
as   O
deletion   O
of   O
lactate   O

(Ldha)   O
prevented   O
their   O

.   O
Conversely   O
,   O

HFSCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
through   O
mitochondrial   O
pyruvate   O
carrier   O

(Mpc1)   O
deletion   O
accelerated   O
their   O
activation   O
and   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
cycle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
Finally   O
,   O
we   O
identify   O
small   O
molecules   O
that   O
increase   O
lactate   O
production   O
by   O
stimulating   O
Myc   O
levels   O
or   O
inhibiting   O
Mpc1   O
carrier   O
activity   O
and   O
can   O
topically   O
induce   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
cycle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
These   O
data   O
suggest   O
that   O
HFSCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
maintain   O
a   O
metabolic   O
state   O
that   O
allows   O
them   O
to   O
remain   O

BACKGROUND   O
:   O
We   O
previously   O

.   O
We   O
hypothesize   O
that   O
the   O
onychodermis   O
could   O
be   O
the   O
nail   O

of   O
the   O

is   O
known   O

We   O
compare   O

between   O
specialized   O

We   O
show   O
using   O

at   O
the   O

The   O

is   O
concomitant   O

The   O

the   O

a   O

of   O
the   O

At   O
later   O
keratinization   O
stages   O
,   O
the   O
inner   O
mechanical   O
properties   O
of   O
the   O
macrofibrils   O
dominate   O
the   O

due   O
to   O
the   O
progressive   O
setting   O

Using   O

Surprisingly   O

(WIHN)   O
in   O

the   O

limited   O
to   O
the   O

Here   O

we   O

the   O

We   O
propose   O
a   O

on   O
tissue   O

that   O
supports   O

establishing   O

BACKGROUND   O
:   O
Dysfunction   O
of   O
the   O
DNA   O

was   O
associated   O
with   O
stem   O

reprogramming   O
.   O
Moreover   O
,   O
DNA   O
methyltransferase   O

deficiency   O
was   O
involved   O
in   O
the   O
differentiation   O
of   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
stem   I-FOLLICLE-NAME

but   O
the   O
molecular   O
mechanisms   O
remain   O
unknown   O
.   O
METHODS   O
:   O
HFSc   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
from   O
human   O
scalp   O
tissues   O
were   O
isolated   O
and   O
cultured   O
.   O
The   O
oil   O
red   O
O   O
staining   O
was   O
used   O
to   O
observe   O
the   O
adipogenesis   O
.   O
The   O
interaction   O
relationship   O
between   O
microRNA   O
(miR)-214-3p   O
and   O
mitogen-activated   O
protein   O
kinase   O
1   O
(MAPK1)   O
was   O
accessed   O
by   O
dual-luciferase   O
reporter   O
gene   O
assay   O
.   O
The   O
methylation   O
level   O
of   O
miR-214-3p   O
promoter   O
was   O
detected   O
by   O
methylation-specific   O
PCR   O
and   O

enrichment   O
of   O
DNMT1   O
in   O

RESULTS   O
:   O
Expression   O
of   O
DNMT1   O
and   O
MAPK1   O
was   O
increased   O
in   O
the   O
HFSc   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
while   O
the   O
expression   O
of   O
miR-214-3p   O
was   O
reduced   O
.   O
Moreover   O
,   O
DNMT1   O
inhibited   O
the   O
expression   O
of   O
miR-214-3p   O
by   O
promoting   O
the   O
promoter   O
methylation   O
of   O
miR-214-3p   O
.   O
Overexpression   O
of   O
DNMT1   O
could   O
reduce   O
the   O
expression   O
of   O
miR-214-3p   O
,   O
but   O
increase   O
the   O
expression   O
of   O
MAPK1   O
and   O
the   O
extent   O
of   O

,   O
leading   O
to   O
enhanced   O
adipogenic   O
differentiation   O
.   O
Importantly   O
,   O
DNMT1   O
promoted   O
skin   O
regeneration   O
in   O
vivo   O
.   O
Conversely   O
,   O
overexpression   O
of   O
miR-214-3p   O
could   O
reverse   O
the   O
effects   O
of   O
DNMT1   O
on   O
adipogenesis   O
of   O
HFSc   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

CONCLUSION   O
:   O
DNMT1   O
promotes   O

,   O
a   O
major   O
Notch   O

,   O
we   O
found   O
that   O

but   O
the   O

Accordingly   O
,   O

that   O

Using   O

in   O
potentiating   O

We   O
first   O
treated   O

evaluated   O
using   O

studied   O
by   O

.   O
In   O
addition   O
,   O
we   O
transduced   O

HFSCs   O
with   O
constitutive-active   O

FGF2   O
up-regulated   O
the   O

promoted   O

The   O
phosphorylated   O

translocated   O
into   O
the   O
nucleus   O
of   O
HFSCs   O
after   O
FGF2   O
treatment   O
,   O
but   O
this   O
translocation   O
was   O
blocked   O
by   O
the   O

FGF2   O
increased   O
the   O

Taken   O
together   O
,   O
we   O
find   O
that   O

promotes   O
the   O
differentiation   O
of   O

into   O

In   O
murine   O
skin   O
,   O
dermal   O
white   O
adipose   O
tissue   O
(DWAT)   O
undergoes   O
major   O
changes   O
in   O
thickness   O
in   O
synchrony   O
with   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
cycle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
(HC);   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
however   O
,   O
the   O
underlying   O
mechanisms   O
remain   O
unclear   O
.   O
We   O
sought   O
to   O
elucidate   O
whether   O
increased   O
DWAT   O
thickness   O
during   O
anagen   O
is   O
mediated   O
by   O
adipocyte   O
hypertrophy   O
or   O
adipogenesis   O
,   O
and   O
whether   O
lipolysis   O
or   O
apoptosis   O
can   O
explain   O
the   O
decreased   O
DWAT   O
thickness   O
during   O
catagen   O
.   O
In   O
addition   O
,   O
we   O
compared   O
HC-associated   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
DWAT   O
changes   O
between   O
spontaneous   O
and   O
depilation-induced   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
(HF)   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
cycling   O
to   O
distinguish   O
between   O
spontaneous   O
and   O
HF   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
trauma-induced   O
events   O
.   O
We   O
show   O
that   O
HC-dependent   O
DWAT   O
remodelling   O
is   O
not   O
an   O
artefact   O
caused   O
by   O
fluctuations   O
in   O
HF   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
down-growth   O
,   O
and   O
that   O
dermal   O
adipocyte   O
(DA)   O
proliferation   O
and   O
hypertrophy   O
are   O
HC-dependent   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
while   O
classical   O
DA   O
apoptosis   O
is   O
absent   O
.   O
However   O
,   O
none   O
of   O
these   O
changes   O
plausibly   O
accounts   O
for   O
HC-dependent   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
oscillations   O
in   O
DWAT   O
thickness   O
.   O
Contrary   O
to   O
previous   O
studies   O
,   O
in   O
vivo   O
BODIPY   O
uptake   O
suggests   O
that   O
increased   O
DWAT   O
thickness   O
during   O
anagen   O
occurs   O
via   O
hypertrophy   O
rather   O
than   O
hyperplasia   O
.   O
From   O
immunohistomorphometry   O
,   O
DWAT   O
thickness   O
likely   O
undergoes   O
thinning   O
during   O
catagen   O
by   O
lipolysis   O
.   O
Hence   O
,   O
we   O
postulate   O
that   O
progressive   O
,   O
lipogenesis-driven   O
DA   O
hypertrophy   O
followed   O
by   O
dynamic   O
switches   O
between   O
lipogenesis   O
and   O
lipolysis   O
underlie   O
DWAT   O
fluctuations   O
in   O
the   O
spontaneous   O
HC   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
and   O
dismiss   O
apoptosis   O
as   O
a   O
mechanism   O
of   O
DWAT   O
reduction   O
.   O
Moreover   O
,   O
the   O
depilation-induced   O
HC   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
displays   O
increased   O
DWAT   O
thickness   O
,   O
area   O
,   O
and   O
DA   O
number   O
,   O
but   O
decreased   O
DA   O
volume/area   O
compared   O
to   O
the   O
spontaneous   O
HC   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
Thus   O
,   O
DWAT   O
shows   O
additional   O
,   O
novel   O
HF   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
wounding-related   O
responses   O
during   O
the   O
induced   O
HC   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

reappraisal   O

important   O
pointers   O
for   O

Suspensions   O
were   O
sent   O
for   O
laboratory   O

Repigmentation   O
was   O
assessed   O
over   O
a   O
follow-up   O
of   O
6   O
months   O

RESULTS   O
:   O
There   O
was   O
a   O
significant   O
increase   O
in   O

added   O
.   O
Immunohistochemical   O

a   O
dynamic   O

therefore;   O
it   O

been   O
considered   O
as   O
valuable   O
and   O

In   O

,   O
somewhat   O
surprisingly   O
,   O
with   O

we   O
detected   O
significant   O

In   O

we   O
noted   O
sharp   O

Consequently   O
,   O
the   O

Finally   O

:   O
Hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

were   O
characterized   O

Its   O
effect   O
on   O
epithelial-mesenchymal   O

was   O
analyzed   O
by   O

RESULT   O
:   O
Dermal   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

were   O
more   O

To   O
study   O
the   O

role   O
the   O
DP   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
has   O
on   O

,   O
we   O
characterize   O
leptin   O

as   O
a   O

by   O

We   O
also   O

that   O
bone   O

evidenced   O
by   O
our   O

We   O
investigated   O
the   O

focused   O
on   O
the   O

We   O
found   O
that   O
miR-101   O
overexpression   O
significantly   O
decreased   O
(p   O

Furthermore   O
,   O
the   O

increased   O
(p   O

it   O
decreased   O

In   O
conclusion   O

that   O

It   O
has   O
long   O

that   O
there   O
is   O
a   O
special   O
affinity   O
of   O
psoriasis   O
for   O
the   O
scalp   O
:   O
Here   O
,   O
it   O
occurs   O
most   O
frequently   O
,   O
lesions   O
terminate   O
sharply   O
in   O

Yet   O
,   O
surprisingly   O
,   O
scalp   O
psoriasis   O
only   O
rarely   O
causes   O
alopecia   O
,   O
even   O
though   O
the   O
pilosebaceous   O
unit   O
clearly   O
is   O
affected   O
.   O
Here   O
,   O
we   O
systematically   O
explore   O
the   O
peculiar   O
,   O
insufficiently   O
investigated   O
connection   O
between   O
psoriasis   O
and   O
growing   O
(anagen)   O
terminal   O
scalp   O

,   O
with   O
emphasis   O
on   O
shared   O
regulatory   O
mechanism   O
and   O
therapeutic   O
targets   O
.   O
Interestingly   O
,   O
several   O
drugs   O
and   O
stressors   O
that   O
can   O
trigger/aggravate   O
psoriasis   O
can   O
inhibit   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
growth   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
(e.g   O
.   O
beta-blockers   O
,   O
chloroquine   O
,   O
carbamazepine   O
,   O
interferon-alpha   O
,   O
perceived   O
stress)   O
.   O
Instead   O
,   O
several   O
anti-psoriatic   O
agents   O
can   O
stimulate   O
hair   O
growth   O
(e.g   O
.   O
cyclosporine   O
,   O
glucocorticoids   O
,   O
dithranol   O
,   O
UV   O
irradiation)   O
,   O
while   O
skin/HF   O
trauma   O
(Kobner   O
phenomenon/depilation)   O
favours   O
the   O
development   O
of   O
psoriatic   O
lesions   O
and   O
induces   O
anagen   O
in   O
"quiescent"   O
(telogen)   O
HFs   O
.   O
On   O
this   O
basis   O
,   O
we   O
propose   O
two   O
interconnected   O
working   O
models   O
:   O
(a)   O
the   O
existence   O
of   O
a   O
bidirectional   O
"hair   O
follicle-psoriasis   O
axis,"   O
along   O
which   O
keratinocytes   O
of   O
anagen   O
scalp   O
HFs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
secrete   O
signals   O
that   O
favour   O
the   O
development   O
and   O
maintenance   O
of   O
psoriatic   O
scalp   O
lesions   O
and   O
respond   O
to   O
signals   O
from   O
these   O
lesions   O
,   O
and   O
(b)   O
that   O
anagen   O
induction   O
and   O
psoriatic   O
lesions   O
share   O
molecular   O
"switch-on"   O
mechanisms   O
,   O
which   O
invite   O
pharmacological   O
targeting   O
,   O
once   O
identified   O
.   O
Therefore   O
,   O
we   O
advocate   O
a   O
novel   O
,   O
cross-fertilizing   O
and   O
integrative   O
approach   O
to   O

RESULTS   O
:   O
In   O
the   O
present   O
study   O
,   O
we   O
found   O
that   O
REGgamma   O
deletion   O
markedly   O
delayed   O
the   O
transition   O
of   O

We   O
also   O

PCR   O
,   O
FACS   O
,   O
Western   O

and   O
immunofluorescent   O
analysis   O
showed   O
that   O
REGgamma   O
deletion   O
could   O
greatly   O
downregulate   O
Lgr5   O
expression   O
in   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

.   O
Meanwhile   O
,   O
REGgamma   O
was   O
demonstrated   O
to   O
directly   O
interact   O
with   O
LHX2   O
and   O
promotes   O
its   O
degradation   O
.   O
Importantly   O
,   O
REGgamma   O
specific   O
deletion   O
in   O
Lgr5+   O

induced   O
the   O
marked   O

CONCLUSION   O
:   O
These   O

together   O
indicate   O
that   O

Objectives   O
:   O
To   O
study   O
the   O
biological   O
properties   O
of   O
melanocytes   O
derived   O
from   O

Methods   O
:   O
From   O
February   O
2014   O
to   O
March   O
2017   O
,   O
26   O
patients   O
with   O
stable   O
vitiligo   O
,   O
who   O
were   O
refractory   O
to   O
all   O
current   O
routine   O
therapy   O
,   O
underwent   O
treatment   O
with   O
transplanted   O
autologous   O

.   O
The   O
skin   O
graft   O
from   O
each   O
patient's   O
occipital   O
region   O
was   O
trimmed   O
to   O
remove   O
excess   O
adipose   O
tissue   O
and   O
some   O
of   O
the   O
upper   O
part   O
of   O
the   O
dermis   O
.   O
The   O
remaining   O
tissue   O
,   O
including   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
and   O
dermal   O
papillae   O
,   O
was   O
cut   O
into   O
pieces   O
and   O
incubated   O
in   O
collagenase   O
type   O
IV   O
and   O
then   O
in   O
trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic   O
acid   O
solutions   O
.   O
The   O
cells   O
were   O
recovered   O
,   O
resuspended   O
in   O
the   O
patient's   O
own   O
serum   O
and   O
then   O
applied   O
to   O
the   O
recipient   O
area   O
.   O
Clinical   O
observations   O
continued   O
for   O
6   O
months   O
to   O
1   O
year   O
.   O
Laboratory   O
experiments   O
were   O
also   O
performed   O
during   O
this   O
time   O
on   O
scalp   O
specimens   O
obtained   O
from   O
normal   O
human   O
volunteers   O
.   O
Cells   O
migrating   O
from   O
the   O
outer   O
root   O
sheath   O
and   O
the   O
dermal   O
papillae   O
at   O
various   O
times   O
of   O
culture   O
were   O
observed   O
using   O
a   O
microscope   O
.   O
Results   O
:   O
Most   O
of   O
the   O
repigmentation   O
in   O
the   O
vitiligo   O
areas   O
appeared   O
within   O
8   O
weeks   O
of   O
transplantation   O
of   O
autologous   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
cells   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
Early   O
skin   O
repigmentation   O
was   O
not   O
uniform   O
and   O
appeared   O
more   O
repigmented   O
than   O
the   O
surrounding   O
normal   O
skin   O
.   O
As   O
time   O
went   O
by   O
,   O
the   O
repigmentation   O
became   O
more   O
obvious   O
and   O
matched   O
the   O
color   O
of   O
the   O
skin   O
around   O
the   O
lesion   O
.   O
Most   O
of   O
the   O
pigmentation   O
presented   O
as   O
a   O
diffuse   O
pattern   O
and   O
was   O
not   O
localized   O
around   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
Among   O
the   O
26   O
patients   O
,   O
9   O
(34.6%)   O
achieved   O
excellent   O
repigmentation   O
,   O
while   O
13   O
(50.0%)   O
had   O
good   O
,   O
3   O
(11.5%)   O
fair   O
and   O
1   O
(3.9%)   O
poor   O
repigmentation   O
.   O
During   O
the   O
follow-up   O
visit   O
at   O
1   O
year   O
,   O
no   O
excess   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
growth   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
was   O
observed   O
in   O
the   O
recipient   O
areas   O
and   O
there   O
was   O
no   O
scarring   O
or   O
ulcer   O
formation   O
in   O
the   O
donor   O
or   O
recipient   O
areas   O
.   O
In   O
the   O
experimental   O
part   O
of   O
the   O
study   O
,   O
many   O
keratinocytes   O
,   O
melanocytes   O
and   O
fibroblasts   O
migrated   O
from   O
the   O
adherent   O
outer   O
root   O
sheath   O
.   O
In   O
later   O
subcultures   O
using   O
a   O
specialized   O
medium   O
,   O
pure   O
melanocytes   O
were   O
obtained   O
that   O
had   O
a   O
strong   O
proliferative   O
capacity   O
and   O
had   O
bipolar   O
or   O
poly-dendritic   O
shapes   O
.   O
On   O
the   O
other   O
hand   O
,   O
cells   O
from   O
the   O
dermal   O
papillae   O
grew   O
radially   O
in   O
primary   O
culture   O
and   O
were   O
almost   O
fibroblast-like   O
.   O
However   O
,   O
a   O
few   O
bipolar   O
melanocytes   O
appeared   O
in   O
the   O
later   O
stage   O
of   O
culture   O
.   O
Conclusions   O
:   O
The   O
results   O
of   O
our   O
study   O
show   O
that   O
transplantation   O
of   O
autologous   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

cells   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
is   O
a   O
simple   O
and   O
effective   O
method   O
to   O
treat   O
patients   O
with   O
stable   O
vitiligo   O
.   O
Hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

are   O
nestin-positive   O

have   O
the   O
capacity   O
to   O
differentiate   O
into   O
various   O

of   O

in   O

.   O
HAP   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

are   O
also   O
involved   O
in   O

.   O
In   O
the   O
present   O
study   O
,   O
we   O
demonstrate   O
that   O
HAP   O
stem   O

co-express   O
nestin   O
and   O
COL17A1   O
in   O

and   O
in   O

.   O
The   O
expression   O
of   O
HAP   O
stem   O
cell   O
markers   O
(nestin   O
and   O
SSEA1)   O
increased   O
after   O
HAP   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
stem-cell   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
colonies   O
were   O
formed   O
,   O
then   O
decreased   O
after   O
differentiation   O
to   O

In   O
contrast   O
COL17A1   O
increased   O
after   O
differentiation   O
to   O
epidermal   O
keratinocytes   O
.   O
These   O
results   O
suggest   O
that   O

is   O
important   O
in   O

.   O
This   O

with   O
the   O

As   O

,   O
we   O

significantly   O
higher   O
than   O

in   O
its   O

which   O
suggest   O
that   O

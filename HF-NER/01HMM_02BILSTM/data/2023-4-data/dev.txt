In   O
this   O
work   O
,   O
a   O
noninvasive   O

was   O
proposed   O
by   O
measuring   O
the   O

Results   O
show   O
that   O
the   O

,   O
the   O

gradually   O
increased   O
.   O
The   O
changes   O
in   O
the   O
melanin   O

could   O
be   O
distinguished   O
by   O
comparing   O
the   O

The   O

showed   O
that   O

remains   O
unclear   O
.   O
We   O
found   O
that   O
STAT3   O

in   O
keratinocytes   O
is   O
required   O
to   O
maintain   O

by   O
negatively   O
controlling   O
the   O
expression   O
of   O

keratin   O
genes   O
.   O
These   O
expression   O
patterns   O
correlated   O
with   O
the   O
onset   O
of   O
dermatitis   O
,   O
which   O
was   O
observed   O
in   O
specific   O
pathogen-free   O
conditions   O

not   O

Thus   O

as   O

bulge   O
or   O
keratinocyte   O
proliferation   O
in   O
the   O
hair   O

.   O
We   O
further   O
propose   O
that   O
metabolic   O
conditions   O
in   O
the   O
HF   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
are   O
organised   O
in   O
accordance   O
with   O
the   O
lactate   O
shuttle   O
,   O
hypothesised   O
to   O
occur   O
in   O
other   O
tissue   O
systems   O
and   O
tumours   O
,   O
but   O
never   O
before   O
described   O
in   O
the   O
HF   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
Specifically   O
,   O
we   O
argue   O
that   O
lactate   O
is   O
produced   O
and   O
exported   O
by   O
glycolytic   O
GLUT1+   O
lower   O
outer   O
root   O
sheath   O
(ORS)   O
keratinocytes   O
.   O
We   O
further   O
propose   O
that   O
lactate   O
is   O
then   O
utilised   O
by   O
neighbouring   O
highly   O
proliferative   O
matrix   O
keratinocytes   O
to   O
fuel   O
oxidative   O
metabolism   O
via   O
MCT1-mediated   O
uptake   O
.   O
Furthermore   O
,   O
as   O
lactate   O
has   O
been   O
described   O
to   O
be   O
immunomodulatory   O
,   O
its   O
production   O
and   O
accumulation   O
could   O
enhance   O
immune   O
tolerance   O
in   O
the   O
HF   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
bulb   O
.   O
Here   O
we   O
delineate   O
how   O
to   O
experimentally   O
probe   O
this   O
hypothesis   O
,   O
define   O
major   O
open   O
questions   O
and   O
present   O
preliminary   O
immunohistological   O
evidence   O
in   O
support   O
of   O
metabolic   O
compartmentalisation   O
and   O
lactate   O
shuttling   O
.   O
Overall   O
,   O
we   O
argue   O
that   O
basic   O
and   O
translational   O
hair   O
research   O
needs   O
to   O
rediscover   O
the   O
importance   O
of   O
lactate   O
in   O
human   O
HF   O
biology   O
,   O
well   O

its   O
recognised   O

oxidative   O
stress   O
sensing   O
appears   O
to   O
be   O
a   O
key   O
factor   O
involved   O
.   O
In   O
this   O
study   O
,   O
we   O
examined   O
the   O
follicular   O
melanin   O
unit   O
in   O
variably   O

from   O
the   O

of   O
healthy   O
individuals   O
(22-70   O

.   O
Over   O
20   O
markers   O
were   O
selected   O
within   O
the   O
following   O
categories   O
:   O
melanocyte-specific   O
,   O
apoptosis   O

,   O

As   O
expected   O
,   O
a   O
reduction   O
in   O

in   O
proportion   O
to   O
the   O
extent   O
of   O

was   O
observed   O
.   O
A   O
major   O
finding   O
of   O
our   O
study   O
was   O
the   O
intense   O
and   O
highly   O

of   O

.   O
ATM   O
is   O
a   O
serine/threonine   O
protein   O
kinase   O
that   O
is   O
recruited   O
and   O
activated   O
by   O
DNA   O
double-strand   O
breaks   O
and   O
functions   O
as   O
an   O
important   O
sensor   O
of   O
reactive   O
oxygen   O
species   O
(ROS)   O
in   O
human   O
cells   O
.   O
The   O
incidence   O
and   O
expression   O
level   O
of   O
ATM   O
correlated   O
with   O
pigmentary   O
status   O
in   O
canities-affected   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
Moreover   O
,   O
increased   O
staining   O
of   O
the   O
redox-associated   O
markers   O
8-OHdG   O
,   O
GADD45   O
and   O
GP-1   O
were   O
also   O
detected   O
within   O
isolated   O
bulbar   O
melanocytes   O
,   O
although   O
this   O
change   O
was   O
not   O
clearly   O
associated   O
with   O
donor   O
age   O
or   O
canities   O
extent   O
.   O
Surprisingly   O
,   O
we   O
were   O
unable   O
to   O
detect   O
any   O
specific   O
change   O
in   O
the   O
expression   O
of   O
other   O
markers   O
of   O

,   O

in   O
the   O
canities-affected   O

compared   O
to   O
surrounding   O

.   O
By   O
contrast   O
,   O
several   O
markers   O
showed   O
distinct   O
expression   O
of   O
markers   O
for   O
oxidative   O
stress   O
and   O
apoptosis/differentiation   O
in   O
the   O
inner   O

well   O
as   O

Using   O
our   O
in   O

model   O
of   O
primary   O
human   O
scalp   O
hair   O
follicle   O
melanocytes   O
,   O
we   O
showed   O
that   O
ATM   O
expression   O
increased   O
after   O
incubation   O
with   O
the   O
pro-oxidant   O
hydrogen   O
peroxide   O
(H2O2)   O
.   O
In   O
addition   O
,   O
this   O
ATM   O
increase   O
was   O
prevented   O
by   O
pre-incubation   O
of   O
cells   O
with   O
antioxidants   O
.   O
The   O
relationship   O
between   O
ATM   O
and   O
redox   O
stress   O
sensing   O
was   O
further   O
evidenced   O
as   O
we   O
observed   O
that   O
the   O
inhibition   O
of   O
ATM   O
expression   O
by   O
chemical   O
inhibition   O
promoted   O
the   O
loss   O
of   O
melanocyte   O
viability   O
induced   O
by   O
oxidative   O
stress   O
.   O
Taken   O
together   O
these   O
new   O
findings   O
illustrate   O
the   O
key   O
role   O
of   O
ATM   O
in   O
the   O
protection   O
of   O

In   O
conclusion   O
,   O
these   O

highlight   O
the   O
remarkable   O
complexity   O
and   O
role   O

The   O
emergence   O
of   O
hair   O
is   O
a   O
defining   O
event   O
during   O
mammalian   O
skin   O
development   O
,   O
but   O
the   O
cellular   O
mechanisms   O
leading   O
to   O
the   O
opening   O
of   O
the   O
hair   O
follicle   O
canal   O
remain   O
poorly   O
characterized   O
.   O
Our   O
previous   O
studies   O
have   O
shown   O
that   O
early   O
hair   O
buds   O
possess   O
a   O
central   O
column   O
of   O
differentiated   O
keratinocytes   O
expressing   O
Keratin   O

(K79)   O
,   O
which   O
marks   O

future   O

Here   O
,   O
we   O
report   O
that   O
during   O
late   O
embryogenesis   O
and   O
early   O
postnatal   O
development   O
,   O
K79+   O
cells   O
at   O
the   O
distal   O
tips   O
of   O
these   O
columns   O
downregulate   O
E-cadherin   O
,   O
change   O
shape   O
,   O
recede   O
and   O
undergo   O
cell   O
death   O
.   O
These   O
changes   O
likely   O
occur   O
independently   O
of   O
sebaceous   O
glands   O
and   O
the   O
growing   O

and   O
serve   O
to   O
create   O
an   O

Defects   O
in   O
this   O
process   O
may   O
underlie   O
phenomena   O
such   O
as   O

may   O
potentially   O

Influence   O
of   O

.   O
Nanocrystals   O
are   O
a   O
universal   O
formulation   O
approach   O
for   O
improved   O
drug   O
delivery   O
of   O
poorly   O
water-soluble   O
drug   O
substances   O
.   O
Besides   O
oral   O
application   O
,   O
also   O
topical   O
application   O
of   O
the   O
nanocrystals   O
is   O
feasible   O
,   O
because   O
the   O
increased   O
kinetic   O
solubility   O
of   O
the   O
nanocrystals   O
results   O
in   O
an   O
increased   O
concentration   O
gradient   O
,   O
thus   O
fostering   O
passive   O
,   O
dermal   O
penetration   O
.   O
Nanocrystals   O
are   O
also   O
promising   O
for   O
targeting   O
drug   O
substances   O
into   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
After   O
penetration   O
into   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
the   O
nanocrystals   O
could   O
form   O
a   O
depot   O
from   O
which   O
the   O
active   O
is   O
released   O
into   O
the   O

.   O
Thus   O
,   O
leading   O

not   O

Therefore   O
,   O
in   O
this   O
study   O
curcumin   O
nanocrystals   O
with   O
a   O
size   O
of   O
about   O
300   O
nm   O
were   O
produced   O
and   O
incorporated   O
into   O
gels   O
with   O
different   O
properties   O
.   O
The   O
efficacy   O
to   O
penetrate   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

,   O
as   O
well   O
as   O
the   O
passive   O
,   O
dermal   O
penetration   O
,   O
was   O
assessed   O
on   O
the   O
ex-vivo   O
pig   O
ear   O
model   O
.   O
Nanocrystals   O
were   O
efficiently   O
taken   O
up   O
by   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
and   O
reached   O
the   O
lower   O
part   O
of   O
the   O
infundibulum   O
.   O
This   O
region   O
is   O
optimal   O
for   O
efficient   O
drug   O
delivery   O
because   O
the   O
barrier   O
of   O
the   O
lower   O
infundibulum   O
is   O
not   O
fully   O
developed   O
and   O
thus   O
more   O
permeable   O
,   O
which   O
results   O
in   O
a   O
less   O
hindered   O
passive   O
diffusion   O
of   O
drug   O
substances   O
.   O
The   O
penetration   O
efficacy   O
of   O
the   O
nanocrystals   O
into   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
was   O
not   O
affected   O
by   O
the   O
different   O
types   O
of   O
vehicles   O
,   O
which   O
represented   O
either   O
oleogels   O
or   O
hydrogels   O
that   O
varied   O
in   O
viscosity   O
as   O
well   O
as   O
in   O
the   O
type   O
and   O
the   O
concentration   O
of   O
the   O
gelling   O
agent   O
.   O
All   O
gels   O
possessed   O
a   O
shear-thinning   O
flow   O
behavior   O
and   O
it   O
is   O
hypothesized   O
that   O
all   O
gels   O
fluidized   O
during   O
the   O
skin   O
massage   O
,   O
whereby   O
leading   O
to   O
similarly   O
low   O
viscosities   O
than   O
the   O
aqueous   O
nanosuspension   O
and   O
thus   O
to   O
similar   O
penetration   O
results   O
.   O
The   O
passive   O
,   O
dermal   O
penetration   O
of   O
curcumin   O
was   O
different   O
for   O
the   O
different   O
gels   O
and   O
the   O
main   O
driving   O
parameter   O
leading   O
to   O
good   O
passive   O
diffusion   O
was   O
caused   O
by   O
good   O
skin   O
hydrating   O
properties   O
of   O
the   O
vehicle   O
.   O
The   O
best   O
passive   O
penetration   O
was   O
achieved   O
from   O
hydrogels   O
that   O
contained   O
a   O
humectant   O
.   O
However   O
,   O
the   O
addition   O
of   O
the   O
humectant   O
reduced   O
the   O
efficacy   O
of   O
the   O
nanocrystals   O
to   O
penetrate   O
the   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
Data   O
so   O
far   O
,   O
therefore   O
,   O
suggest   O
that   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
targeting   O
with   O
nanocrystals   O
that   O
are   O
suspended   O
in   O
water   O
or   O
simple   O
,   O
shear-thinning   O
gels   O
is   O
highly   O
effective   O
.   O
However   O
,   O
the   O
addition   O
of   O
other   O
excipients   O
,   O
e.g   O
.   O
humectants   O
,   O
to   O
these   O
vehicles   O
might   O
cause   O
changes   O
in   O
the   O
penetration   O
profiles   O
.   O
More   O

in   O
this   O

RESULTS   O
:   O
The   O
TAT-PBX1   O
fusion   O
was   O
produced   O
in   O
inclusion   O
bodies   O
and   O
heterogenously   O
expressed   O
in   O
Rosetta   O
(DE3)   O

aims   O
to   O
evaluate   O
the   O
effect   O
of   O
protocatechuic   O

(PCA)   O
on   O
human   O
hair   O
follicle   O
melanocytes   O
(HFM)   O
.   O
Normal   O
primary   O
HFM   O
were   O
isolated   O
and   O
cultured   O
till   O
logarithmic   O
period   O
of   O

,   O
then   O
treated   O
with   O
different   O
concentrations   O
of   O
PCA   O
(0.1-200   O

.   O
In   O
addition   O
,   O
we   O
have   O
also   O
measured   O
the   O
contents   O
of   O
superoxide   O
dismutase   O
(SOD)   O
and   O
glutathione   O
(GSH)   O
in   O
PCA   O
treated   O
HFM   O
.   O
Vitamin   O
C   O
was   O
used   O
as   O
a   O
positive   O
control   O
.   O
The   O
result   O
showed   O
that   O
PCA   O
can   O
decrease   O
the   O
synthesis   O
of   O
melanin   O
and   O
the   O
tyrosinase   O
activity   O
with   O
IC50   O

,   O
respectively   O
,   O
at   O
the   O
treatment   O
time   O
of   O
24   O
hours   O
,   O
without   O
inducing   O
any   O
cytotoxicity   O
in   O
HFM   O
cells   O
.   O
In   O
addition   O
,   O
the   O
mRNA   O
transcription   O
and   O
protein   O
expression   O
levels   O
of   O
TRP-1   O
,   O
TRP-2   O
and   O
MITF   O
significantly   O
decreased   O
with   O
a   O
dose-dependent   O
manner   O
after   O
24-hour   O
PCA   O
treated   O
in   O
HFM   O
cells   O
.   O
Furthermore   O
,   O
PCA   O
has   O
significantly   O
increased   O
the   O
SOD   O
and   O
GSH   O
activity   O
in   O
a   O
dose-dependent   O
manner   O
for   O
24-hour   O
PCA   O
treatment   O
.   O
This   O
study   O
suggested   O
that   O
PCA   O
has   O
an   O
inhibitory   O
effect   O
on   O
the   O
production   O
of   O
melanin   O
through   O
down-regulation   O
of   O
the   O
expression   O
of   O
melanogenesis-related   O
protein   O
and   O
the   O
effect   O
of   O
anti-oxidation   O
,   O
which   O
could   O
be   O
useful   O
for   O
the   O
therapy   O
of   O
melanin   O

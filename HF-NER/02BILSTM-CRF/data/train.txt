RESULTS: O
Full-length O

we O
found O
that O

decreased, O
and O
those O

BACKGROUND: O
Melanogenesis O
is O
a O
biological O
process O
resulting O
in O
the O
production O
of O
melanin O
pigment, O
which O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
prevention O
of O
sun-induced O
skin O
injury O
and O
determines O
the O
hair O
and O
skin O
color. O
Melanin O
has O
the O
ability O
to O
block O
ultraviolet O
radiation O
and O
scavenge O
free O
oxygen O
radicals, O
thus O
protecting O
the O
skin O
from O
their O
harmful O
effects. O
Agents O
that O
increase O
melanin O
synthesis O
in O
melanocytes O
may O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
photodamage O
and O
skin O
cancer. O
Hence, O
various O
approaches O
have O
been O
proposed O
to O
increase O
the O
synthesis O
of O
melanin. O
METHODS: O
The O
current O
study O
aimed O
to O
develop O
a O
three-dimensional O
hair O
follicle-like O
tissue O
(HFLT) O
model O
with O
human O

papilla, I-BIO-NAME
melanocytes, O
and O

This O
model O
showed O
enhanced O
melanogenesis-related O
protein O
expression O
after O
rice O
bran O
ash O
extract O
(RBE) O
treatment. O
Next, O
we O
investigated O
the O
melanogenic O
effect O
of O
RBE O
in O
the O
HFLT O
and O
compared O
the O
results O
to O
those O
of O
hair B-BIO-NAME

organ O

model. O
RESULTS: O
RBE O
was O
found O
to O
significantly O
increase O
the O
expression O
of O
microphthalmia-associated O
transcription O
factor, O
a O
key O
transcription O
factor O
involved O
in O
melanin O
production, O
in O
both O
HFLT O
and O
organ O
culture O
models. O
Results O
showed O
that O
melanogenesis-related O
protein O
expression O
levels O
were O
higher O
in O
the O
RBE O
group O
compared O
to O
those O
in O
the O
control O
group. O
Similar O
results O
were O
obtained O
by O
immunohistochemistry. O
CONCLUSION: O
Our O
data O
suggested O
that O
RBE O
promotes O
melanin O
biosynthesis. O
Taken O
together, O
this O
simple O
in O

HFLT O
model O
system O
has O
the O
potential O
to O
provide O
significant O
insights O
into O
the O
underlying O
molecular O
mechanisms O
of O
HF B-BIO-NAME
melanogenesis, O
and O
hence O
can O
be O
used O
for O
controlled O
evaluation O
of O
the O
efficacy O
of O
new O
materials O
for O
melanogenesis. O

In O

Moreover, O
the O

In O

As O
this O

is O
still O
in O

exist, O
for O
which O
we O
briefly O
delineate O

in O
the O
near O

however, O
in O
this O
study, O
we O
found O
hairless O
(HR) O

at O
a O
relatively O
high O

in O

We O
observed O
that, O

In O
this O

Considering O
the O

The O

To O
better O

we O
developed O

modulate O

BACKGROUND: O
The O

Herein, O
we O
sought O
to O
evaluate O
the O

RESULTS: O
All O

By O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Phospho-S6 O
is O

(P O

Clinical O

Mechanistically, O

They O
show O

only. O
The O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
sequences O
of O
the O
gene O
and O

are O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
other O
species O
and O
identical O
to O
Capra O

However, O
the O
expression O
of O
VIM O
and O

was O
proportional O
to O
that O
of O
the O

And O
vimentin O
expressed O
only O
in O
the O

Thus, O

us O
to O

immunoreactivity O
for O

in O

from O

A O
wide O
range O
of O

for O
the O
total O
spermine O
and O

was O
observed O
in O
the O
compartments O
of O
hair B-BIO-NAME

The O
highest O
degree O
of O
immunoreactivity O
for O

was O
observed O
in O
the O
matrix, O
in O
the O
Huxley's O
layer, O
in O
the O
deeper O
Henle's O
layer, O
and O
in O
the O

of O

while O
moderate O
immunoreactivity O
existed O
in O
the O

and O
the O

followed O
by O
lower O
immunoreactivity O
in O
the O

including O
the O

and O
in O
the O
deeper O

in O
which O
the O
immunoreactivity O
was O
also O
evident O
in O
their O
nuclei. O
In O
addition, O
somewhat O
surprisingly, O
with O
IHC O
by O
APUT-32 O
mAb, O
we O
detected O
significant O
levels O
of O
putrescine O
in O
the O
compartments, O
in O
which O
the O
immunostaining O
pattern O
was O
the O
closely O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
the O
total O
spermine O
and O

Thus, O
among O
these O
compartments, O
the O
cell O
types O
of O
the O
matrix, O
the O
Huxley's O
layer, O
the O
deeper O
Henle's O
layer, O
and O
the O
cuticle O
of O
the O
inner O

seem O
to O
have O
the O
biologically O
higher O
potential O
in O
compartments O
of O

maybe O
suggesting O
that O
they O
are O
involved O
more O
critically O
in O
the O

of O

In O
addition, O
we O
noted O
sharp O
differences O
of O
immunostaining O
by O
IHCs O
between O
ASPM-29 O
mAb O
and O
APUT-32 O
mAb O
in O
the O

cells O
and O

ASPM-29 O
mAb O
resulted O
in O
strong O
staining O
in O
both O
the O
cell O
types, O
but O
APUT-32 O
mAb O
showed O
only O
very O
light O
staining O
in O
both O

Consequently, O
the O
use O
of O
the O

could O
be O
extremely O
useful O
in O

Here, O
we O
developed O
a O
method O
for O
large-scale O
preparation O
of O
HFGs B-BIO-NAME
in O

via O
self-organization O

We O
mixed O

cells O
in O

and O
seeded O
them O
in O
microwells O

Over O

period, O
cells O
initially O
formed O

and O
then O
spatially O

features. O
These O
self-sorted B-BIO-NAME
hair I-BIO-NAME

germs I-BIO-NAME
(ssHFGs) B-BIO-NAME
were O
shown O
to O
be O

hair-follicle B-BIO-NAME
and O
shaft O
generation O
upon O
intracutaneous O
transplantation O
into O
the O

This O
finding O
facilitated O
the O
large-scale O
preparation O
of O
approximately O
5000 O
ssHFGs B-BIO-NAME
in O
a O
microwell-array O
chip O
made O

We O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
integrity O
of O
the O
oxygen O
supply O
through O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
silicone O
chip O
was O
crucial O
to O
enabling O
both O

and O
subsequent O
hair O

generation. O
Finally, O
spatially O
aligned O
ssHFGs B-BIO-NAME
on O
the O

were O
encapsulated O
into O
a O

and O
simultaneously O
transplanted O
into O
the O

to O
preserve O

This O

BACKGROUND: O
Hair B-BIO-NAME

is O
miniorgan O
constituted O

The O

OBJECTIVE: O
This O

the O

in O
the O

METHODS: O
Dermal B-BIO-NAME

cells I-BIO-NAME
were O
challenged O
with O
H2O2 O
to O
induce O
premature O
senescence O
and O
the O
proliferation, O

were O
characterized. O
Its O

was O
analyzed O
by O
co-culture O
in O

and O
implantation O
of O

in O

RESULT: O
Dermal B-BIO-NAME
papilla I-BIO-NAME
cells I-BIO-NAME
were O
more O
resistant O
to O
oxidative O
stress-induced O
apoptosis O
than O
dermal O

The O
surviving O
dermal B-BIO-NAME

cells I-BIO-NAME
showed O
signs O
of O

but O
still O
preserved O

expression. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
failure O
to O
respond O
to O
mitogenic O
stimulation O
from O
keratinocytes, O
they O
lost O
the O
ability O
to O
induce O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle I-BIO-NAME
neogenesis, I-BIO-NAME
promoted O

and, O
importantly, O
suppressed O

They O
produced O
higher O
levels O

Functionally, O

inhibited O

CONCLUSION: O
Stress-induced O

In O

Based O
on O
our O
results, O
the O
expression O
of O
beta-catenin O
can O
activate O
the O

regulate O
the O
expression O

To O

These O

pathways. O
Among O
these O
is O

Scube3. O
We O
show O
that O
in O
normal O

Scube3 O
is O
expressed O
only O
in O
dermal O

but O
not O

SCUBE3 O
protein O

to O
induce O

Moreover, O

are O
partially O

Thus, O

We O

Then, O

We O
found O
that O

Furthermore, O

In O
conclusion, O

While O

that O

Here, O
we O

This O

Interestingly, O

we O
investigated O
the O

The O
results O

Furthermore, O
the O

In O
this O

The O
hair O

axis: O
Shared O
regulatory O
mechanisms O
and O
therapeutic O
targets. O
It O
has O
long O
been O
known O
that O
there O
is O
a O
special O
affinity O
of O
psoriasis O
for O
the O
scalp: O
Here, O
it O
occurs O
most O
frequently, O
lesions O
terminate O
sharply O
in O
frontal O
skin O
beyond O
the O
hair O
line O
and O
are O
difficult O
to O
treat. O
Yet, O
surprisingly, O
scalp O
psoriasis O
only O
rarely O
causes O
alopecia, O
even O
though O
the O
pilosebaceous O
unit O
clearly O
is O
affected. O
Here, O
we O
systematically O
explore O
the O
peculiar, O
insufficiently O
investigated O
connection O
between O
psoriasis O
and O
growing O
(anagen) O
terminal O
scalp O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles I-BIO-NAME
(HFs), B-BIO-NAME
with O
emphasis O
on O
shared O
regulatory O
mechanism O
and O
therapeutic O
targets. O
Interestingly, O
several O
drugs O
and O
stressors O
that O
can O
trigger/aggravate O
psoriasis O
can O
inhibit O
hair B-BIO-NAME
growth I-BIO-NAME
(e.g. O
beta-blockers, O
chloroquine, O
carbamazepine, O
interferon-alpha, O
perceived O
stress). O
Instead, O
several O
anti-psoriatic O
agents O
can O
stimulate O
hair O
growth O
(e.g. O
cyclosporine, O
glucocorticoids, O
dithranol, O
UV O
irradiation), O
while O
skin/HF O
trauma O
(Kobner O
phenomenon/depilation) O
favours O
the O
development O
of O
psoriatic O
lesions O
and O
induces O
anagen O
in O
"quiescent" O
(telogen) O
HFs. O
On O
this O
basis, O
we O
propose O
two O
interconnected O
working O
models: O
(a) O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
bidirectional O
"hair O
follicle-psoriasis O
axis," O
along O
which O
keratinocytes O
of O
anagen O
scalp O
HFs B-BIO-NAME
secrete O
signals O
that O
favour O
the O
development O
and O
maintenance O
of O
psoriatic O
scalp O
lesions O
and O
respond O
to O
signals O
from O
these O
lesions, O
and O
(b) O
that O
anagen O
induction O
and O
psoriatic O
lesions O
share O
molecular O
"switch-on" O
mechanisms, O
which O
invite O
pharmacological O
targeting, O
once O
identified. O
Therefore, O
we O
advocate O
a O
novel, O
cross-fertilizing O
and O
integrative O
approach O
to O
psoriasis O
and O
hair O
research O
that O
systematically O
characterizes O
the O
"HF-psoriasis O
axis," O
focused O
on O
identification O
and O
therapeutic O
targeting O
of O
selected, O
shared O
signalling O
pathways O
in O
the O
future O
management O
of O
both, O
psoriasis O
and O
hair O

Pattern O

(PHL) O
is O
a O

In O

To O
understand O
the O

we O
re-examine O
the O
dynamics O
of O

and O
ask O
the O
question, O
"why O
do O

In O
the O

of O

we O
looked O
back O
in O
the O
older O
literature O
for O
helpful O

"lost O

and O
reprise O
a O
1978 O

of O

in O

provide O
a O
"morphologic O

Thus, O
we O
have O
reviewed O
the O
role O

and O
we O
propose O
that O

may O
contribute O
to O
the O

RESULTS: O
Here, O

BACKGROUND: O

of O

in O

cycle I-BIO-NAME
involves O
dynamic, O

OBJECTIVE: O
The O
function O
of O
REGgamma O
in O

is O
still O
unclear. O
METHODS: O
Here, O
we O
used O

T O
cells, O
inducible O
293WT O
and O

mechanism O
of O

in O

RESULTS: O
In O
the O
present O
study, O
we O
found O
that O
REGgamma O
deletion O
markedly O
delayed O
the O
transition O
of O

from O
telogen O
to O

We O

Interestingly, O
the O
results O
from O
real-time O
PCR, O
FACS, O
Western O

and O
immunofluorescent O
analysis O
showed O
that O
REGgamma O
deletion O
could O
greatly O
downregulate O

in O
the O

Meanwhile, O
REGgamma O
was O
demonstrated O
to O
directly O

and O

Importantly, O
REGgamma O

deletion O
in O

induced O
the O
marked O
delay O
of O
hair B-BIO-NAME

CONCLUSION: O
These O
data O
together O
indicate O
that O

was O
a O

Moreover, O
these O

In O
this O

we O
explore O
the O
features O
of O
the O
microfollicle, O
a O
human O
hair B-BIO-NAME

organoid O

based O
on O

For O

up O

21 O
days, O
and O
characterized O

The O
microfollicles O
showed O
hair-specific O

in O
both O
early O
and O
late O
stages O
of O
cultivation. O
The O

was O
also O
compared O
with O
human O

in O

to O

The O

up O
to O
75% O

Based O
on O
our O

the O

appears O
to O
be O
a O
practical O
tool O
for O

The O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle I-BIO-NAME
is O
a O
classical O
model O
for O
studying O
epithelial-mesenchymal O
interactions. O
Given O
the O
critical O
role O
of O
fibroblast O

factor O
8 O
(Fgf8) O
in O
embryonic O
development, O
we O
generated O
a O
mouse O
model O
that O
overexpresses O
Fgf8 O
specifically O
in O
the O
epidermis. O
Interestingly, O
these O
mutant O
mice O
exhibited O
stunted, O
smaller O

and O
severe O
hypotrichosis. O
Histological O
analysis O
showed O
that O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME

in O
the O
mutants O
were O
arrested O
at O
stage O

of O
hair B-BIO-NAME

The O
density O
of O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles I-BIO-NAME
in O
the O
mutant O
mice O
was O
also O
lower O
compared O
to O
that O
in O
the O
control O
mice. O
Overexpression O
of O
Fgf8 O
inhibited O
the O
proliferation O
of O
epidermal O
cells O
and O
simultaneously O
promoted O
apoptosis, O
leading O
to O
the O
arrest O
of O
hair B-BIO-NAME

Further O

showed O
that O
sonic O

(Bmp4) O
were O
downregulated O
and O
upregulated, O
respectively. O
To O
summarize, O
our O

demonstrates O
that O

plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O

therefore, O
all O

key O
players O

to O
be O
identified. O
Here, O
we O
present O
evidence O
that O
implicates O
myelin O

zero-like O
3 O
(MPZL3), O
a O
multifunctional O
nuclear-encoded O
mitochondrial O
protein O
known O
to O

in O

in O

By O
analysing O

we O
show O
that O
in O
the O

commence O
HF B-BIO-NAME
cycling O
with O

However, O
Mpzl3 O

display O
strikingly O

cycling, O
i.e. O
a O

during O
the O
second B-BIO-NAME

compared O
to O

suggesting O
that O
MPZL3 O
inhibits O

We O
also O
show O
that O
intrafollicular O
MPZL3 O
protein O
expression O
fluctuates O
in O
a O
hair O

manner. O
In O

an O

where O
it O

In O

MPZL3 O
is O

These O

In O
summary, O
the O

CONCLUSIONS: O
As O
in O
the O
isolated O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles, I-BIO-NAME
some O
target O
genes O
were O
homogenously O

during O
the O

confirmed O
their O
clear O

In O
fact, O
K4 O
was O
almost O
absent O
in O

while O

In O
particular, O
the O
strong O

makes O
it O
an O
eligible O
marker O
to O
track O
the O

RESULTS: O
Here, O
we O
show O
that O
a O

The O
action O

Significance: O
Hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles I-BIO-NAME
are O
complex O
miniorgans O
that O
reside O
in O
the O
dermal O
layer O
of O
the O
skin. O
When O
the O
skin O
is O
wounded, O
epidermal O
stem O
cells O
in O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle I-BIO-NAME
activate O
and O
start O
migrating O
into O
the O
wound O
site, O
differentiating O
into O
epidermal O
cells. O
and O
contributing O
to O
the O
reepithelialization O
of O
the O
wound. O
The O
hair O
follicles O
represent O
the O
deepest O
epidermal O
elements O
in O
the O
skin, O
which O
are O
extremely O
beneficial O
in O
partial-thickness O

where O
the O

from O
the O

Recent O
Advances: O

in O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME

is O
important O
for O

In O

several O
clinical O
studies O
have O
shown O
successful O
harvesting O
and O
transplantation O
of O
hair B-BIO-NAME

as O
a O
treatment O
modality O
to O
accelerate O
wound O

Critical O
Issues: O
Deep O
and O
large O
wounds O
require O
hospitalization O
and, O
without O
exception, O
surgical O
treatment. O
Harvesting O
and O
direct O
transplantation O
of O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles I-BIO-NAME
could O
provide O
a O
great O
source O
of O
autologous O

The O
procedure O
can O
be O
done O
in O

on O
the O

but O
almost O
all O
the O

BACKGROUND: O
Cashmere O

make O
an O
outstanding O
contribution O
to O
the O
livestock O
textile O
industry O
and O
their O
cashmere O
is O
famous O
for O
its O
slenderness O

has O
been O
extensively O

However, O
there O

In O
order O
to O
explore O
the O

transition O
through O
the O
follicle B-BIO-NAME
cycle I-BIO-NAME
and O
the O
role O
of O
key O
genes O
in O
this O
cycle, O
we O
used O
a O
transcriptome O
sequencing O
technique O
to O
sequence O
the O
skin O
of O
Inner O
Mongolian O
cashmere O
goats O
during O
different O

We O
analyzed O
the O
variation O
and O

in O
genes O
throughout O
the O
whole O

cycle. I-BIO-NAME
We O
then O
verified O
the O

of O
the O

using O

RESULTS: O
The O
growth O
cycle O
of O

could O
be O
divided O
into O
three O
distinct O
periods: O
a O
growth O
period O
(March-September), O
a O

period O
(September-December), O
and O
a O

period O
(December-March). O
The O
results O

that O

supported O
the O

to O
the O

further O
supported O
the O

Quantitative O

showed O
that O
KAP3-1, O
KRTAP O
8-1, O
and O
KRTAP O
24-1 O
genes O
had O
close O
positive O
correlation O
with O
the O

and O
their O

was O
consistent O
with O
the O

CONCLUSION: O
The O

March O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
the O

KAP O

the O
growth O

of O
secondary B-BIO-NAME

follicle I-BIO-NAME
cashmere O
growth, O
and O
their O
regulation O
was O
consistent O
with O
the O
cashmere O

cycle. O
But O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle I-BIO-NAME
development-related O
genes O
are O
expressed O
earlier O
than O
cashmere O
growth, O
indicating O
that O
cycle O

could O
alter O
the O
temporal O

of O
cashmere. O
This O
study O
laid O
a O
theoretical O
foundation O
for O
the O
study O
of O
the O

and O
provided O
evidence O
for O
key O

Like O
the O
skin, O
our O
hair O
shows O
striking O
changes O
with O
age, O
producing O
hairs O
with O
altered O
diameter, O

The O
biology O

has O
focused O
predominately O
on O
various O
aspects O
of O
the O
hair O

and O
the O

but O
surprisingly O
the O

of O
the O

on O
the O

and O

has O
been O
generally O
overlooked. O
Hair O
loss O
affects O
both O
sexes O
with O
incidence O
increasing O
with O
age. O
In O
men, O
male O
pattern-balding O
(androgenetic O
alopecia) O
is O
driven O
by O
androgens O
and O
follows O
a O
specific O
pattern O
of O
frontotemporal O
and O
vertex O
regression. O
Women O
also O
experience O
female O
pattern O
hair O
loss O
(FPHL), O
presenting O
as O
more O
general, O
diffuse O
hair O
thinning. O
Hair O
thinning O
in O
women O
is O
commonly O
associated O
with O
the O
menopause, O
corresponding O
with O
other O
age-related O
changes O
in O
skin. O
The O
rapidly O
growing O
hair B-BIO-NAME

undergoes O
continued O
renewal O
throughout O
the O
life O

of O
an O
individual, O
where O
it O
is O
exposed O
to O
a O
substantial O
number O
of O
extrinsic O
and O
intrinsic O
stressors. O
As O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle I-BIO-NAME
sits O
deep O
within O
the O
dermis O
with O
its O
bulb O
residing O
in O
the O
hypodermis, O
detrimental O
age-related O
changes O
in O
the O
surrounding O
scalp O
skin O
may O
likely O
disrupt O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME

machinery. O
The O
impacts O
of O
these O
changes O
are O
unknown, O
but O
evidence O
suggests O
that O
scalp O

and O
hair B-BIO-NAME

aging O
go O
hand-in-hand. O
Herein, O
we O
summarize O
the O
evidence O
that O
the O
age-related O
changes O
observed O
in O
sun-exposed O
human O
skin O
also O
occur O
in O

that O

However, O
when O

RESULTS/CONCLUSION: O
We O

The O

However, O
incorporating O

The O
aim O
of O
this O

was O
to O
determine O
whether O

could O
be O
incorporated O
into O

(differentiated O

and O
also O
increased O

which O
is O
a O

When O
neopapillae O
were O
incorporated O
into O
the O
dermis O
of O

they O
stimulated O
epidermal O

resulting O
in O

The O

that O

Moreover, O

stable O
vitiligo. O
Background: O
Vitiligo O
is O
characterized O
by O
the O
loss O
and/or O
dysfunction O
of O
melanocytes O
in O
the O
skin O
and O
has O
a O
profound O
impact O
on O
the O
social O
interactions O
of O
patients. O
Although O
there O
are O
many O
treatment O
options O
for O
vitiligo, O
the O
outcome O
is O
frequently O
unsatisfactory, O
especially O
for O
patients O
with O
stable O
vitiligo. O
Objectives: O
To O
study O
the O
biological O
properties O
of O
melanocytes O
derived O
from O
human O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles I-BIO-NAME
and O
to O
observe O
the O
efficacy O
of O
using O
transplants O
of O
autologous O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle I-BIO-NAME
cells I-BIO-NAME
to O
treat O
patients O
with O
stable O
vitiligo. O
Methods: O
From O
February O
2014 O
to O
March O
2017, O
26 O
patients O
with O
stable O
vitiligo, O
who O
were O
refractory O
to O
all O
current O
routine O
therapy, O
underwent O
treatment O
with O
transplanted O
autologous O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle I-BIO-NAME
cells. I-BIO-NAME
The O
skin O
graft O
from O
each O
patient's O
occipital O
region O
was O
trimmed O
to O
remove O
excess O
adipose O
tissue O
and O
some O
of O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
the O
dermis. O
The O
remaining O
tissue, O
including O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles I-BIO-NAME
and O
dermal O
papillae, O
was O
cut O
into O
pieces O
and O
incubated O
in O
collagenase O
type O
IV O
and O
then O
in O
trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic O
acid O
solutions. O
The O
cells O
were O
recovered, O
resuspended O
in O
the O
patient's O
own O
serum O
and O
then O
applied O
to O
the O
recipient O
area. O
Clinical O
observations O
continued O
for O
6 O
months O
to O
1 O
year. O
Laboratory O
experiments O
were O
also O
performed O
during O
this O
time O
on O
scalp O
specimens O
obtained O
from O
normal O
human O
volunteers. O
Cells O
migrating O
from O
the O
outer O
root O
sheath O
and O
the O
dermal O
papillae O
at O
various O
times O
of O
culture O
were O
observed O
using O
a O
microscope. O
Results: O
Most O
of O
the O
repigmentation O
in O
the O
vitiligo O
areas O
appeared O
within O
8 O
weeks O
of O
transplantation O
of O
autologous O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle I-BIO-NAME
cells. I-BIO-NAME
Early O
skin O
repigmentation O
was O
not O
uniform O
and O
appeared O
more O
repigmented O
than O
the O
surrounding O
normal O
skin. O
As O
time O
went O
by, O
the O
repigmentation O
became O
more O
obvious O
and O
matched O
the O
color O
of O
the O
skin O
around O
the O
lesion. O
Most O
of O
the O
pigmentation O
presented O
as O
a O
diffuse O
pattern O
and O
was O
not O
localized O
around O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles. I-BIO-NAME
Among O
the O
26 O
patients, O
9 O
(34.6%) O
achieved O
excellent O
repigmentation, O
while O
13 O
(50.0%) O
had O
good, O
3 O
(11.5%) O
fair O
and O
1 O
(3.9%) O
poor O
repigmentation. O
During O
the O
follow-up O
visit O
at O
1 O
year, O
no O
excess O
hair B-BIO-NAME
growth I-BIO-NAME
was O
observed O
in O
the O
recipient O
areas O
and O
there O
was O
no O
scarring O
or O
ulcer O
formation O
in O
the O
donor O
or O
recipient O
areas. O
In O
the O
experimental O
part O
of O
the O
study, O
many O
keratinocytes, O
melanocytes O
and O
fibroblasts O
migrated O
from O
the O
adherent O
outer O
root O
sheath. O
In O
later O
subcultures O
using O
a O
specialized O
medium, O
pure O
melanocytes O
were O
obtained O
that O
had O
a O
strong O
proliferative O
capacity O
and O
had O
bipolar O
or O
poly-dendritic O
shapes. O
On O
the O
other O
hand, O
cells O
from O
the O
dermal O
papillae O
grew O
radially O
in O
primary O
culture O
and O
were O
almost O
fibroblast-like. O
However, O
a O
few O
bipolar O
melanocytes O
appeared O
in O
the O
later O
stage O
of O
culture. O
Conclusions: O
The O
results O
of O
our O
study O
show O
that O
transplantation O
of O
autologous O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle I-BIO-NAME
cells I-BIO-NAME
is O
a O
simple O
and O
effective O
method O
to O
treat O
patients O
with O
stable O
vitiligo. O
Hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles I-BIO-NAME
(especially O
the O

In O

demonstrate O
that O

The O

increased O
after O
HAP B-BIO-NAME

In O
contrast O
COL17A1 O
increased O

These O

Sox13 O
is O
a O

However, O
its O

and O
its O

remain O
to O

elucidated. O
To O
address O
these O
questions, O
we O
generated O
Sox13-LacZ-knock-in O
mice O
(Sox13LacZ/+), O
in O
which O
the O
LacZ O
reporter O
gene O
was O
inserted O
in-frame O
into O
exon O
2, O
which O
contains O
the O
translation O
initiation O

X-gal O
staining O
in O
Sox13LacZ/+ O
embryos O
revealed O
that O
Sox13 O
is O
initially O
expressed O
in O
the O
epithelial O
portion O
of O
the O
placode, O
and O
subsequently O
in O
the O
hair O
germ O
and O
the O
hair O

during O
early O

development. I-BIO-NAME
In O
postnatal O
catagen O
and O
anagen, O
Sox13 O
was O
detected O
in O
the O
epithelial O
sheath, O
whereas O
in O
telogen, O
Sox13 O
was O
localized O
in O
the O
bulge O
region, O
where O
hair B-BIO-NAME

reside. O
Immunohistochemistry O
with O
an O
anti-beta-galactosidase O

and O
anti-hair O
keratin O
antibodies O
that O
specifically O
mark O
the O
different O
layers O
of O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME

revealed O
that O
Sox13 O
was O
predominantly O
expressed O
in O
the O
outer O
root O
sheath O
in O
anagen. O
However, O
the O
integumentary O
structures O
of O
Sox13LacZ/LacZ O
mice O
were O
grossly O
and O
histologically O
indistinguishable O
from O
those O
of O
wild O
type O
mice. O
These O
results O
suggest O
that O
although O
Sox13 O
is O
dispensable O
for O
epidermal O
and O
adnexal O
development, O
Sox13 O
is O
a O
useful O
marker O
for O

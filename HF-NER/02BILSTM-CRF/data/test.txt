examined. O
Also, O
the O

were O
explored. O
Furthermore, O
a O

Furthermore, O

during O
which O

Because O

the O

Here, O

Interestingly, O

Because O

this O

Importantly, O
the O

As O
a O

The O

The O

Recently, O

Therefore, O

be O
key O
for O

the O

In O

In O

we O
focused O
on O

as O
a O
candidate O

for O

In O

that O

a O

Furthermore, O

In O

when O

From O

as O

was O

that O

OBJECTIVE: O

METHODS: O
Cellular O
viability O
was O
determined O
using O
the O
MTT O
assay, O
TUNEL O
staining, O
western O

analysis O
and O
LDH O

assay. O
Adenovirus-loaded O
Sirt1 O
was O
transduced O
into O
HFSCs B-BIO-NAME
to O
overexpress O
Sirt1 O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
TNFalpha. O
Mitochondrial O
function O
was O
determined O
using O
JC-1 O
staining, O
mitochondrial O
ROS O

and O
western O

RESULTS: O
Sirt1 O
was O
downregulated O
in O
response O
to O
the O
TNFalpha O
treatment. O
Additionally, O
TNFalpha O
stress O
reduced O
the O
viability, O
mobility O
and O
proliferation O
of O
HFSCs, O
and O
these O
effects O
were O
reversed O
by O
the O
overexpression O
of O
Sirt1. O
At O
the O
molecular O
level, O
Sirt1 O
overexpression O
attenuated O
TNFalpha-mediated O
mitochondrial O
damage, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
increased O
mitochondrial O
energy O
metabolism, O
decreased O
mitochondrial O
ROS O
generation, O
stabilized O
mitochondrial O
potential O
and O
blockage O
of O
the O
mitochondrial O
apoptotic O
pathway. O
Furthermore, O
Sirt1 O
modulated O
mitochondrial O
homeostasis O
by O
activating O
the O
MAPK-ERK-Mfn2 O
axis; O
inhibition O
of O
this O
pathway O
abrogated O
the O
protective O
effects O
of O
Sirt1 O
on O
HFSC B-BIO-NAME
survival, O
migration O
and O
proliferation. O
SIGNIFICANCE: O
Based O
on O
our O
results, O
the O
inflammatory O
stress-mediated O
HFSC O
injury O
may O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
decrease O
in O
Sirt1 O
expression O
and O
subsequent O
mitochondrial O
dysfunction. O
Accordingly, O
strategies O
designed O
to O
enhance O
Sirt1 O
expression O
would O
be O
an O
effective O
approach O
to O
enhance O
the O
survival O
of O
HFSCs B-BIO-NAME
in O
the O
inflammatory O
microenvironment. O

Because O

The O

was O
reaching O
to O
nearly O
90% O
when O

exhibited O
a O

The O
stability O
of O
the O

in O

enhanced. O
After O

the O

The O

After O

The O

highly O

Conclusively, O

a O

In O

the O

Human O

Thus, O
we O

On O

The O

of O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME

known O
as O
the O
infundibulum O
or O
hair O
canal, O
provides O
a O
passageway O
for O
hair O
shaft O

and O
sebum O

Recent O
studies O
have O
indicated O
that O
the O
infundibulum O
and O

are O
lined O
by O
molecularly O
distinct O

Here, O
we O
ablated O
Gata6 O
from O
the O

and O
observed O
dilation O
of O
both O
the O

independent O

Constitutive O
loss O

yielded O
only O

into O
anagen, O
while O
unperturbed O

mice O
possessed O

normal O
skin O
and O

Furthermore, O
we O
noted O
that O
Keratin O

and O
Gata6 O
expression O
and O

did O
not O
depend O
upon O
each O
other. O
Our O
findings O
implicate O
Gata6 O
in O
maintaining O
the O

and O
suggest O
that O
regulation O
of O
this O

may O
be O
compromised O
in O
pathologies O
such O
as O

that O
are O

through O

Changes O
in O

alter O

in O
peripheral O

through O
slow O
entrainment O
of O
the O

It O
remains O
unclear O
whether O

can O
achieve O
rapid O

Here O
we O
show O
that O

with O

Mechanistically, O
light O

are O
interpreted O
by O
M1-type O
intrinsically O
photosensitive O
retinal O

(ipRGCs), O
which O
signal O

the O

Subsequently, O
efferent O

are O
immediately O
activated. O
Increased O
norepinephrine O

in O
skin O
promotes O
hedgehog O
signaling O
to O
activate O

Thus, O
external O
light O
can O
directly O
regulate O

an O
ipRGC-SCN O

system O

Since O
activation O
of O

is O
not O
limited O
to O

this O

can O
also O
facilitate O

in O

Then O

Moreover, O

The O

that O
the O

To O
the O

the O

BACKGROUND: O
Costunolide O
(COS), O
a O
naturally O

sesquiterpene O
lactone, O
is O
known O
to O
exert O
anti-inflammatory, O

This O

was O
undertaken O
to O

effects O

on O

of O

METHODS: O

and O

The O

RESULTS: O
Costunolide O
significantly O
promoted O
the O
proliferation O
of O
hHFDPCs, B-BIO-NAME
which O
is O
comparable O
to O
that O
of O
tofacitinib. O
COS O
also O
inhibited O
the O

in O

While O
COS O
increased O
the O
level O
of O

it O
suppressed O

Our O

illustrate O
that O

We O
took O
advantage O
of O

(WIHG) O
to O
explore O
the O
relationship O
between O

First, O
we O
showed O
that O
WIHG O
is O
dependent O
on O
CD11b+F4/80+ O
macrophages O
at O
7-11 O
days O
after O

Next, O
using O
CX3CR1gfp/+:CCR2rfp/+ O
mice O
to O
capture O
the O
dynamic O
spectrum O
of O
macrophage O
phenotypes O
during O
wound O

we O
showed O
that O
wound O

transition O
from O
a O
CX3CR1lo/med O
to O
a O
CX3CR1hi O
phenotype O
at O
the O
onset O
of O
WIHG. O
Finally, O
WIHG O
is O
abolished O
in O
mice O
deficient O
for O
CX3CR1, O
delayed O
with O

of O

and O
rescued O
with O

Overall, O
we O
propose O
a O
model O
in O
which O
transforming O

and O

are O
critical O
for O
recruiting O
and O
maintaining O
the O

critical O
for O

their O

In O

has O
been O

However, O
obtaining O

is O
becoming O

as O

There O
is O

an O

however, O
remain O

According O
to O
recent O

(in O

the O

the O

while O

The O

In O

In O
conclusion, O

a O

In O

The O

to O

that O
can O
be O

as O
a O

We O

We O
showed O
that O

In O

We O

Although O
the O

(such O
as O

the O

In O

on O

In O
this O

the O
results O

that O

In O
addition, O
the O

provided O
that O
HFSCs B-BIO-NAME
could O
promote O

and O
the O
main O
function O
is O
to O

Therefore, O

In O
this O

we O
found O
that O

the O

In O

Collectively, O
our O

that O

The O

Although O

the O

Thus, O
we O
systematically O

In O

we O
previously O

In O
this O

we O
have O
subsequently O
focused O

on O

of O
the O

We O
then O
adopted O
a O

and O

to O
investigate O
the O

We O
observed O
that O

in O

Multifaceted O

in O

BACKGROUND: O
The O
method O
of O
generating O
bioengineered O
skin O
constructs O
was O
pioneered O
several O
decades O
ago; O
nowadays O
these O
constructs O
are O
used O
regularly O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
severe O
burns O
and O
nonhealing O
wounds. O
Commonly, O
these O
constructs O
are O
comprised O
of O
skin O
fibroblasts O
within O
a O
collagen O
scaffold, O
forming O
the O
skin O
dermis, O
and O
stratified O
keratinocytes O
overlying O
this, O
forming O
the O
skin O
epidermis. O
In O
the O
past O
decade O
there O
has O
been O
a O
surge O
of O
interest O
in O
bioengineered O
skins, O
with O
researchers O
seeking O
alternative O
cell O
sources, O
or O
scaffolds, O
from O
which O
constructs O
can O
be O
established, O
and O
for O
more O
biomimetic O
equivalents O
with O
skin O
appendages. O
OBJECTIVES: O
To O
evaluate O
whether O
human O
hair B-BIO-NAME

cells I-BIO-NAME
can O
act O
as O
an O
alternative O
cell O
source O
for O
engineering O
the O
dermal O
component O
of O
engineered O
skin O
constructs. O
METHODS: O
We O
established O
in O
vitro O
skin O
constructs O
by O
incorporating O
into O
the O
collagenous O
dermal O
compartment: O
(i) O
primary O
interfollicular O

(ii) O

In O

were O
established O
by O
mixing O
dermal O
cells O
and O
keratinocytes O
in O
chambers O
on O

of O
immunologically O
compromised O
mice. O
RESULTS: O
All O
fibroblast O
subtypes O
were O
capable O
of O
supporting O
growth O
of O
overlying O
epithelial O
cells, O
both O
in O

and O
in O

However, O
we O
found O
hair B-BIO-NAME

dermal I-BIO-NAME

to O
be O
superior O
to O
fibroblasts O
in O
their O
capacity O
to O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Human O

can O
be O
readily O
interchanged O
with O

In O

the O
hypothesis O
that O

Accordingly, O

enhance O
the O

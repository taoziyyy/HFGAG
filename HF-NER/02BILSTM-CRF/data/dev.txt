the O

have O
been O
evaluated O

In O
this O
work, O
a O
noninvasive O
spectroscopy O
was O
proposed O
by O
measuring O
the O
diffuse O
reflectance O
of O
mouse O
skin O
and O
analyzing O
the O

value. O
Results O
show O
that O
the O
skin O

was O
relatively O
high O
when O
hair B-BIO-NAME

were O
at O
the O
telogen O

and O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O

and O
decreased O
with O
the O

of O
the O

When O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME

entered O
into O
the O
catagen O
stage, O
the O
diffuse O
reflectance O
gradually O
increased. O
The O
changes O
in O
the O
melanin O
content O
of O
skin O
had O
contrary O
dynamics. O
Substages O
of O
the O

could O
be O
distinguished O
by O
comparing O
the O
changes O
in O

with O
the O

This O
study O
provided O
a O
new O
method O
for O

Our O

In O

The O
results O

was O
extracted O
using O
2 O
solvent O
systems, O
water O
and O
30% O

The O

had O
higher O

However, O
the O

was O
higher O
than O
that O
of O

As O
a O
result, O
the O
PE O

and O
found O
that O
the O
major O
component O

Afterward, O
the O
PE O

was O
tested O
for O
its O

to O
activate O
the O
expression O
of O

At O
a O

this O
extract O
promoted O
various O

comparable O
to O

were O
prepared O
to O

The O
particle O

were O
228 O

After O

the O

was O
218 O

respectively, O
which O
was O
comparable O

size. O
However, O
at O
40 O
C, O
the O
particle O

dramatically O
increased O
(315 O

The O
fluorescent O

was O
used O
to O
evaluate O
the O
potential O
of O

had O
better O

To O
conclude, O
the O
PE O
aqueous O
extract, O
mainly O
composed O
of O

can O
activate O

In O

Through O

we O

that O

We O

we O

We O

Furthermore, O

its O

Overall, O
we O

that O

the O

Previously, O
we O
have O

that O

However, O
the O

Herein, O
we O
investigated O
the O
mechanism O
of O
policosanol O
against O
androgenetic O

(AGA). O
AGA O
was O
induced O
in O

Policosanol O
(0.5 O

was O
applied O
topically O
on O

was O
applied O
topically O
as O

The O

such O
as O

to O
evaluate O
the O

We O
found O
lower O

ratio O
in O

Policosanol O
suppressed O

as O
shown O
by O
improving O

activity. O
The O
MTS O
assay O
showed O
that O
policosanol O
markedly O
inhibited O
the O

Western O

showed O
that O
policosanol O
significantly O
reduced O
the O

The O
optimal O

was O
obtained O
with O

In O
conclusion, O
policosanol O
prevents O

Canities O
(or O

is O
an O

of O
the O
natural O
pigment O
called O
melanin O
from O
hair. O
While O
the O

the O
loss O
of O
melanogenically-active O
melanocytes O
from O
the O
anagen O

remains O

oxidative O
stress O

to O
be O
a O

In O
this O

we O
examined O
the O

unit O
in O
variably O
pigmented O
follicles O
from O
the O
aging O
human O
scalp O
of O
healthy O
individuals O
(22-70 O
years). O
Over O
20 O
markers O
were O
selected O
within O
the O
following O
categories: O
melanocyte-specific, O
apoptosis, O
cell O
cycle, O
DNA O
repair/damage, O
senescence O
and O
oxidative O
stress. O
As O
expected, O
a O
reduction O
in O
melanocyte-specific O
markers O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
canities O
was O
observed. O
A O
major O
finding O
of O
our O
study O
was O
the O
intense O
and O
highly O
specific O
nuclear O
expression O
of O
Ataxia O
Telangiectasia O
Mutated O
(ATM) O
protein O
within O
melanocytes O
in O
anagen O
hair B-BIO-NAME

ATM O
is O
a O
serine/threonine O
protein O
kinase O
that O
is O
recruited O
and O
activated O
by O
DNA O
double-strand O
breaks O
and O
functions O
as O
an O
important O
sensor O
of O
reactive O
oxygen O
species O
(ROS) O
in O
human O
cells. O
The O
incidence O
and O
expression O
level O
of O
ATM O
correlated O
with O
pigmentary O
status O
in O
canities-affected O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles. I-BIO-NAME
Moreover, O
increased O
staining O
of O
the O
redox-associated O
markers O
8-OHdG, O
GADD45 O
and O
GP-1 O
were O
also O
detected O
within O
isolated O
bulbar O
melanocytes, O
although O
this O
change O
was O
not O
clearly O
associated O
with O
donor O
age O
or O
canities O
extent. O
Surprisingly, O
we O
were O
unable O
to O
detect O
any O
specific O
change O
in O
the O
expression O
of O
other O
markers O
of O
oxidative O
stress, O
senescence O
or O
DNA O
damage/repair O
in O
the O
canities-affected O
melanocytes O
compared O
to O
surrounding O
bulbar O
keratinocytes. O
By O
contrast, O
several O
markers O
showed O
distinct O
expression O
of O
markers O
for O
oxidative O
stress O
and O
apoptosis/differentiation O
in O
the O
inner O
root O
sheath O
(IRS) O
as O
well O
as O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle. I-BIO-NAME
Using O
our O
in O

model O
of O
primary O
human O
scalp O
hair O
follicle O
melanocytes, O
we O
showed O
that O
ATM O
expression O
increased O
after O
incubation O
with O
the O
pro-oxidant O
hydrogen O
peroxide O
(H2O2). O
In O
addition, O
this O
ATM O
increase O
was O
prevented O
by O
pre-incubation O
of O
cells O
with O
antioxidants. O
The O
relationship O
between O
ATM O
and O
redox O
stress O
sensing O
was O
further O
evidenced O
as O
we O
observed O
that O
the O
inhibition O
of O
ATM O
expression O
by O
chemical O
inhibition O
promoted O
the O
loss O
of O
melanocyte O
viability O
induced O
by O
oxidative O
stress. O
Taken O
together O
these O
new O
findings O
illustrate O
the O
key O
role O
of O
ATM O
in O
the O
protection O
of O
human O
hair O
follicle O
melanocytes O
from O
oxidative O
stress/damage O
within O
the O
human O
scalp O
hair O
bulb. O
In O
conclusion, O
these O
results O
highlight O
the O
remarkable O
complexity O
and O
role O
of O
redox O
sensing O
in O
the O
status O
of O
human O

Our O

The O
emergence O

event O

but O
the O
cellular O
mechanisms O
leading O
to O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
hair O

remain O
poorly O
characterized. O
Our O

that O

possess O
a O

which O
marks O

Here, O
we O
report O
that O
during O
late O
embryogenesis O
and O
early O
postnatal O
development, O
K79+ O
cells O
at O
the O
distal O
tips O
of O
these O
columns O
downregulate O
E-cadherin, O
change O

and O
undergo O

death. O
These O
changes O
likely O
occur O
independently O
of O
sebaceous O

and O
the O
growing O
hair O

and O
serve O
to O
create O
an O

Defects O
in O
this O

nanocrystals: O
Influence O
of O

Nanocrystals O
are O
a O
universal O
formulation O
approach O
for O
improved O
drug O
delivery O
of O
poorly O
water-soluble O
drug O
substances. O
Besides O
oral O
application, O
also O
topical O
application O
of O
the O
nanocrystals O
is O
feasible, O
because O
the O
increased O
kinetic O
solubility O
of O
the O
nanocrystals O
results O
in O
an O
increased O
concentration O
gradient, O
thus O
fostering O
passive, O
dermal O
penetration. O
Nanocrystals O
are O
also O
promising O
for O
targeting O
drug O
substances O
into O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle. I-BIO-NAME
After O
penetration O
into O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle, I-BIO-NAME
the O
nanocrystals O
could O
form O
a O
depot O
from O
which O
the O
active O
is O
released O
into O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle. I-BIO-NAME
Thus, O
leading O
to O
a O
long-lasting O
and O
very O
efficient O
dermal O
drug O
delivery. O
The O
efficacy O
of O
nanocrystals O
to O
penetrate O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles I-BIO-NAME
and O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
vehicle O
in O
which O
the O
nanocrystals O
are O
suspended O
was O
not O
yet O
investigated. O
Therefore, O
in O
this O
study O
curcumin O
nanocrystals O
with O
a O
size O
of O
about O
300 O
nm O
were O
produced O
and O
incorporated O
into O
gels O
with O
different O
properties. O
The O
efficacy O
to O
penetrate O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles, I-BIO-NAME
as O
well O
as O
the O
passive, O
dermal O
penetration, O
was O
assessed O
on O
the O
ex-vivo O
pig O
ear O
model. O
Nanocrystals O
were O
efficiently O
taken O
up O
by O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles I-BIO-NAME
and O
reached O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
the O
infundibulum. O
This O
region O
is O
optimal O
for O
efficient O
drug O
delivery O
because O
the O
barrier O
of O
the O
lower O
infundibulum O
is O
not O
fully O
developed O
and O
thus O
more O
permeable, O
which O
results O
in O
a O
less O
hindered O
passive O
diffusion O
of O
drug O
substances. O
The O
penetration O
efficacy O
of O
the O
nanocrystals O
into O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicles I-BIO-NAME
was O
not O
affected O
by O
the O
different O
types O
of O
vehicles, O
which O
represented O
either O
oleogels O
or O
hydrogels O
that O
varied O
in O
viscosity O
as O
well O
as O
in O
the O
type O
and O
the O
concentration O
of O
the O
gelling O
agent. O
All O
gels O
possessed O
a O
shear-thinning O
flow O
behavior O
and O
it O
is O
hypothesized O
that O
all O
gels O
fluidized O
during O
the O
skin O
massage, O
whereby O
leading O
to O
similarly O
low O
viscosities O
than O
the O
aqueous O
nanosuspension O
and O
thus O
to O
similar O
penetration O
results. O
The O
passive, O
dermal O
penetration O
of O
curcumin O
was O
different O
for O
the O
different O
gels O
and O
the O
main O
driving O
parameter O
leading O
to O
good O
passive O
diffusion O
was O
caused O
by O
good O
skin O
hydrating O
properties O
of O
the O
vehicle. O
The O
best O
passive O
penetration O
was O
achieved O
from O
hydrogels O
that O
contained O
a O
humectant. O
However, O
the O
addition O
of O
the O
humectant O
reduced O
the O
efficacy O
of O
the O
nanocrystals O
to O
penetrate O
the O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle. I-BIO-NAME
Data O
so O
far, O
therefore, O
suggest O
that O
hair B-BIO-NAME
follicle I-BIO-NAME
targeting O
with O
nanocrystals O
that O
are O
suspended O
in O
water O
or O
simple, O
shear-thinning O
gels O
is O
highly O
effective. O
However, O
the O
addition O
of O
other O
excipients, O
e.g. O
humectants, O
to O
these O
vehicles O
might O
cause O
changes O
in O
the O
penetration O
profiles. O
More O

consists O
of O
three O

Recently, O
the O

and O
the O

has O
been O
re-examined O
under O

However, O
the O

in O
the O

remain O
completely O
elucidated. O
In O
the O

we O
investigated O
whether O
the O

(MITF)) O
in O
the O

we O
have O
also O
measured O
the O

glutathione O
(GSH) O
in O
PCA O
treated O
HFM. O
Vitamin O

The O
result O
showed O
that O
PCA O
can O
decrease O
the O
synthesis O
of O
melanin O
and O
the O

In O
addition, O
the O
mRNA O
transcription O
and O
protein O
expression O
levels O
of O
TRP-1, O
TRP-2 O
and O
MITF O
significantly O
decreased O
with O
a O
dose-dependent O
manner O
after O
24-hour O
PCA O
treated O
in O
HFM O
cells. O
Furthermore, O
PCA O
has O
significantly O
increased O
the O
SOD O
and O
GSH O
activity O
in O
a O
dose-dependent O
manner O
for O
24-hour O
PCA O
treatment. O
This O
study O
suggested O
that O
PCA O
has O
an O
inhibitory O
effect O
on O
the O
production O
of O
melanin O
through O
down-regulation O
of O
the O
expression O
of O
melanogenesis-related O
protein O
and O
the O
effect O
of O
anti-oxidation, O
which O
could O
be O
useful O
for O
the O
therapy O
of O
melanin O

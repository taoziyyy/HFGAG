    "text": "Epidermal Wnt controls hair follicle induction by orchestrating dynamic signaling crosstalk between the epidermis and dermis. A signal first arising in the dermis to initiate the development of hair follicles has been described for many decades. Wnt is the earliest signal known to be intimately involved in hair follicle induction. However, it is not clear whether the inductive signal of Wnt arises intradermally or intraepidermally. Whether Wnt acts as the first dermal signal to initiate hair follicle development also remains unclear. Here we report that Wnt production mediated by Gpr177, the mouse Wls ortholog, is essential for hair follicle induction. Gpr177, encoding a multipass transmembrane protein, regulates Wnt sorting and secretion. Cell type-specific abrogation of the signal reveals that only epidermal, but not dermal, production of Wnt is required. An intraepidermal Wnt signal is necessary and sufficient for hair follicle initiation. However, the subsequent development depends on reciprocal signaling crosstalk of epidermal and dermal cells. Wnt signals within the epidermis and dermis and crossing between the epidermis and dermis have distinct roles and specific functions in skin development. This study not only defines the cell type responsible for Wnt production, but also reveals a highly dynamic regulation of Wnt signaling at different steps of hair follicle morphogenesis. Our findings uncover a mechanism underlying hair follicle development orchestrated by the Wnt pathway.",

The mammalian hair follicle relies on adult resident stem cells and their progeny to fuel and maintain hair growth throughout the life of an organism. The cyclical and initially synchronous nature of hair growth makes the hair follicle an ideal system with which to define homeostatic mechanisms of an adult stem cell population. Recently, we demonstrated that Hopx is a specific marker of intestinal stem cells. Here, we show that Hopx specifically labels long-lived hair follicle stem cells residing in the telogen basal bulge. Hopx (+) cells contribute to all lineages of the mature hair follicle and to the interfollicular epidermis upon epidermal wounding. Unexpectedly, our analysis identifies a previously unappreciated progenitor population that resides in the lower hair bulb of anagen-phase follicles and expresses Hopx. These cells co-express Lgr5, do not express Shh and escape catagen-induced apoptosis. They ultimately differentiate into the cytokeratin 6-positive (K6) inner bulge cells in telogen, which regulate the quiescence of adjacent hair follicle stem cells. Although previous studies have suggested that K6 (+) cells arise from Lgr5-expressing lower outer root sheath cells in anagen, our studies indicate an alternative origin, and a novel role for Hopx-expressing lower hair bulb progenitor cells in contributing to stem cell homeostasis.",

Cashmere goat (Capra hircus) hair follicle development and cycling can be divided into three stages: anagen, catagen and telogen. To elucidate the genes involved in hair follicle development and cycling in cashmere goats, transcriptome profiling of skin was carried out by analysing samples from three hair follicle developmental stages using RNA-Seq. The RNA-Seq analysis generated 8487344, 8142514 and 7345335 clean reads in anagen, catagen and telogen stages, respectively, which provided abundant data for further analysis. A total of 1332 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, providing evidence that the development of hair follicles among the three distinct stages changed considerably. A total of 683 genes with significant differential expression were detected between anagen and catagen, 530 DEGs were identified between anagen and telogen, and 119 DEGs were identified between catagen and telogen. A large number of DEGs were predominantly related to cellular process, cell & cell part, binding, biological regulation and metabolic process among the different stages of hair follicle development. In addition, the Wnt, Shh, TGF-beta and Notch signaling pathways may be involved in hair follicle development and the identified DEGs may play important roles in these signaling pathways.

Systematic ablation of previously identified dermal papilla (DP) signature genes in embryonic DP precursors will reveal their functional roles during hair follicle morphogenesis. In this study, we validate Enpp2/Autotaxin as one of the highest expressed signature genes in postnatal DP, and demonstrate specific expression of this lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-generating enzyme in embryonic dermal condensates. We further identify dermal and epidermal expression of several LPA receptors, suggesting that LPA signaling could contribute to follicle morphogenesis in both mesenchymal and epithelial compartments. We then use the recently characterized Cre-expressing Tbx18 knock-in line to conditionally ablate Enpp2 in embryonic DP precursors. Despite efficient gene knockout in embryonic day 14. 5 (E14. 5) dermal condensates, morphogenesis proceeds regularly with normal numbers, lengths, and sizes of all hair follicle types, suggesting that Enpp2 is not required for hair follicle formation. To interrogate DP signature gene expression, we finally isolate control and Enpp2-null DP precursors and identify the expression and upregulation of LIPH, an alternative LPA-producing enzyme, suggesting that this gene could functionally compensate for the absence of Enpp2.

    "text": "Foxp1 maintains hair follicle stem cell quiescence through regulation of Fgf18. Hair follicles cyclically degenerate and regenerate throughout adult life and require regular stem cell activation to drive the cycle. In the resting phase of the hair cycle, hair follicle stem cells are maintained in a quiescent state until they receive signals to proliferate. We found that the forkhead transcription factor Foxp1 is crucial for maintaining the quiescence of hair follicle stem cells. Loss of Foxp1 in skin epithelial cells leads to precocious stem cell activation, resulting in drastic shortening of the quiescent phase of the hair cycle. Conversely, overexpression of Foxp1 in keratinocytes prevents cell proliferation by promoting cell cycle arrest. Finally, through both gain-and loss-of-function studies, we identify fibroblast growth factor 18 (Fgf18) as the key downstream target of Foxp1. We show that exogenously supplied FGF18 can prevent the hair follicle stem cells of Foxp1 null mice from being prematurely activated. As Fgf18 controls the length of the quiescent phase and is a key downstream target of Foxp1, our data strongly suggest that Foxp1 regulates the quiescent stem cell state in the hair follicle stem cell niche by controlling Fgf18 expression.",

Hair follicles (HFs) are regenerative miniorgans that offer a highly informative model system to study the regulatory mechanisms of hair follicle stem cells (hfSCs) homeostasis and differentiation. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is key in both of these processes, governing hfSCs quiescence in the bulge and differentiation of matrix progenitors. However, whether canonical or noncanonical pathways of BMP signaling are responsible for these processes remains unresolved. Here, we conditionally ablated two canonical effectors of BMP signaling, Smad1 and Smad5 during hair morphogenesis and postnatal cycling in mouse skin. Deletion of Smad1 and Smad5 (dKO) in the epidermis during morphogenesis resulted in neonatal lethality with lack of visible whiskers. Interestingly, distinct patterns of phospho-Smads (pSmads) activation were detected with pSmad8 restricted to epidermis and pSmad1 and pSmad5 exclusively activated in HFs. Engraftment of dKO skin revealed retarded hair morphogenesis and failure to differentiate into visible hair. The formation of the prebulge and bulge reservoir for quiescent hfSCs was precluded in dKO HFs which remained in prolonged anagen. Surprisingly, in postnatal telogen HFs, pSmad8 expression was no longer limited to epidermis and was also present in dKO bulge hfSCs and matrix progenitors. Although pSmad8 activity alone could not prevent dKO hfSCs precocious anagen activation, it sustained efficient postnatal differentiation and regeneration of visible hairs. Together, our data suggest a pivotal role for canonical BMP signaling demonstrating distinguished nonoverlapping function of pSmad8 with pSmad1 and pSmad5 in hfSCs regulation and hair morphogenesis but a redundant role in adult hair progenitors differentiation.",

During morphogenesis, Wnt signaling is well-characterized in the initiation of HF patterning but less is known about which particular Wnt ligands are required and whether individual Wnt ligands act in an indispensable or redundant manner during postnatal hfSCs anagen onset and HF cycle progression. Previously, we described the function of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling target gene WNT7a in intrinsic regulation of hfSCs homeostasis in vivo. Here, we investigated the role of Wnt7b, which was also intrinsically upregulated in hfSCs during physiological and precocious anagen after BMP inhibition in vivo. We demonstrated Wnt7b to be a direct target of canonical BMP signaling in hfSCs and using Wnt7b conditional gene targeting during HF morphogenesis revealed disrupted HF cycling including a shorter anagen, premature catagen onset with overall shorter hair production, and diminished HF differentiation marker expression. Additionally, we observed that postnatal ablation of Wnt7b resulted in delayed HF activation, affecting both the hair germ and bulge hfSCs but still maintaining a two-step sequence of HF stimulation. Interestingly, Wnt7b cKO hfSCs participated in reformation of the new HF bulge, but with slower self-renewal. These findings demonstrate the importance of intrinsic Wnt7b expression in hfSCs regulation and normal HF cycling and surprisingly reveal a nonredundant role for Wnt7b in the control of HF anagen length and catagen entry which was not compensated by other Wnt ligands.",

Compared with the ana-DPCs, the tel-DPCs lost the capacity to form cell aggregates and showed lower cell proliferation rate. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that 825 genes were differentially expressed by at least threefold between the two DPC lines. These genes were significantly enriched in cell cycle control, cell division, and chromosome partitioning from the Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups of proteins (KOG) database and in cell cycle, cell adhesion molecules, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and p53 signaling pathway from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) database. Enrichment analyses revealed that in the middle of the telogen the DPCs of secondary hair follicles (SHFs) seemed on the one hand to promote the degeneration of SHFs and cessation of cashmere growth, while on the other hand to resist self-apoptosis and prepare for the regeneration or revivification of fully functional dermal papillae. These findings provide a better understanding of hair follicle growth and will be useful for identification of novel molecules associated with the control of hair growth cycle.",

Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) play important roles in neovascularization, tissue development, and angiogenesis. In this study, changes in VEGF expression patterns and microvessel density (MVD), and their correlations, were investigated during hair follicle development in epidermal appendages of Liaoning cashmere goats. Polyclonal antibodies to VEGF and microvessels were used for monthly immunohistochemical examinations of normal skin specimens from adult female goats for one year. VEGF was expressed in the hair bulb of primary and secondary hair follicles, the outer and inner root sheaths, sebaceous glands (ductal and secretory portions), eccrine sweat glands (ductal and secretory portions), and the epidermis. Abundant expression of VEGF was observed in the follicular basement membrane zone surrounding the bulb matrix and in ductal and secretory portions of eccrine sweat glands. The change in VEGFs in primary hair follicles showed a bimodal pattern, with the first peak observed from March to May, and the second in August. Maximal expression in secondary hair follicles occurred in May and August. Therefore, VEGF expression in primary and secondary hair follicles is synchronized throughout the year, and is correlated to hair development. In the later telogen and anagen phases, VEGF expression was higher in the secondary, compared to the primary, hair follicle. Changes in MVD also showed a bimodal pattern with peaks in May and August. VEGF expression and MVD showed moderate and strongly positive correlation in the primary and secondary hair follicles, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the dynamic expression of Wnt family member 5A (Wingless-type MMTV integration Wnt site family, member 5a) in murine hair cycle and its inhibitory effects on follicle in vivo. METHODS: Situ hybridization in full-thickness skin was used to observe the change of mouse protein expression in different growth stages, and Ad-Wnt5a was injected after defeathering to observe the hair follicle growth in vivo. RESULTS: The Wnt5a mRNA was expressed at birth, and was firstly increased then decreased along with the progress of the hair cycle. It reached the peak in advanced stage of growth cycle (P < 0. 05). Rhoa and beta-catenin expression levels were significantly decreased in three groups. Rac2 expression was significantly up-regulated, and the expression level of Wnt5a, Shh and Frizzled2 was increased, but less significantly than group 2. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Wnt5a mRNA is consistent with change of murine follicle cycle, and has obvious inhibitory effects on the growth of hair follicle in vivo, indicating that it is antagonistic to Wnts pathway and interferes the growth of follicle together.",

We present our initial findings on decorin expression patterns during induced murine hair follicle (HF) cycles. It was found that decorin expression is exclusively restricted to the epidermis, outer root sheath and sebaceous glands during the anagen phase, which correlates with the upregulation of decorin mRNA and protein expression in depilated murine dorsal skin. Furthermore, we used a functional approach to investigate the effects of recombinant human decorin (rhDecorin) via cutaneous injection into HFs at various murine hair cycle stages. The local injection of rhDecorin (100 mug/ml) into the hypodermis of depilated C57BL/6 mice at anagen delayed catagen progression. In contrast, rhDecorin injection during the telogen phase caused the premature onset of anagen, as demonstrated by the assessment of the following parameters: (i) hair shaft length, (ii) follicular bulbar diameter, (iii) hair follicle cycling score and (iv) follicular phase percentage. Taken together, our results suggest that decorin may modulate follicular cycling and morphogenesis.

Understanding the epigenetic mechanisms that control the activation of adult stem cells holds the promise of tissue and organ regeneration. Hair follicle stem cells have emerged as a prime model to study stem cell activation. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling controls multiple aspects of skin epithelial regeneration, with its excessive activity promoting the hyperactivation of hair follicle stem/progenitor cells and tumorigenesis. The contribution of chromatin factors in regulating Wnt/beta-catenin pathway function in these processes is unknown. Here, we show that chromatin effector Pygopus homolog 2 (Pygo2) produced by the epithelial cells facilitates depilation-induced hair regeneration, as well as beta-catenin-induced activation of hair follicle stem/early progenitor cells and trichofolliculoma-like skin hyperplasia. Pygo2 maximizes the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin targets, but is dispensable for beta-catenin-mediated expansion of LIM/homeobox protein Lhx2 (+) cells, in the stem/early progenitor cell compartment of the hair follicle. Moreover, beta-catenin and Pygo2 converge to induce the accumulation and acetylation of tumor suppressor protein p53 upon the cell cycle entry of hair follicle early progenitor cells and in cultured keratinocytes. These findings identify Pygo2 as an important regulator of Wnt/beta-catenin function in skin epithelia and p53 activation as a prominent downstream event of beta-catenin/Pygo2 action in stem cell activation.",

However, none of these ciliogenic genes has been linked to ciliopathy, a group of disorders caused by abnormal formation or function of cilia. To determine whether there is a genetic and molecular link between ciliopathies and skin morphogenesis, we investigated the role of RPGRIP1L, a gene mutated in Joubert (JBTS) and Meckel (MKS) syndromes, two severe forms of ciliopathy, in the context of skin development. We found that RPGRIP1L is essential for hair follicle morphogenesis. Specifically, disrupting the Rpgrip1l gene in mice resulted in reduced proliferation and differentiation of follicular keratinocytes, leading to hair follicle developmental defects. These defects were associated with significantly decreased primary cilium formation and attenuated hedgehog signaling. In contrast, we found that hair follicle induction and polarization and the development of interfollicular epidermis were unaffected.

We showed that the hHF-MSCs seeded at various densities quickly adhered to and proliferated well on the microspheres, thus generating at least hundreds of millions of hHF-MSCs on 1 g of CultiSpher ()-G within 12 days. This resulted in a cumulative cell expansion of greater than 26-fold. Notably, the maximum and average proliferation rates in 3D culture were significantly greater than that of the 2D culture.

Lysozyme is a well-known antimicrobial peptide that exists widely in mammalian skin and it is also expressed by pilosebaceous units. However, the exact location of lysozyme in hair follicles and whether it exerts any direct effects on hair follicle growth are unclear. To determine whether lysozyme affected hair growth in vitro, micro-dissected mouse vibrissae follicles (VFs) were treated in serum-free organ culture for 3 days with lysozyme (1-10mug/ml). After that, the effects of lysozyme on dermal papilla (DP) cells were also investigated. Lysozyme was mainly identified in DP and dermal sheath regions of VF by immunochemistry. In addition, 5-10mug/ml lysozyme had a promoting effect on shaft production. It was also associated with significant proliferation of matrix keratinocytes by immunofluorescence observation. Furthermore, lysozyme promoted hair growth by increasing the levels of alkaline phosphatase and lymphoid enhancer factor 1 in DP, as determined by Western blotting. These results indicate that lysozyme is a promoter of VF growth via enhancing the hair-inductive capacity of DP cells during organ culture.",

In mammals, hair follicles cover most of the body surface and exhibit precise and stereotyped orientations relative to the body axes. Follicle orientation is controlled by the planar cell polarity (PCP ; or, more generally, tissue polarity) system, as determined by the follicle mis-orientation phenotypes observed in mice with PCP gene mutations. The present study uses conditional knockout alleles of the PCP genes Frizzled6 (Fz6), Vangl1, and Vangl2, together with a series of Cre drivers to interrogate the spatio-temporal domains of PCP gene action in the developing mouse epidermis required for follicle orientation. Fz6 is required starting between embryonic day (E) 11. 5 and E12. 5. Eliminating Fz6 in either the anterior or the posterior halves of the embryo or in either the feet or the torso leads to follicle mis-orientation phenotypes that are limited to the territories associated with Fz6 loss, implying either that PCP signaling is required for communicating polarity information on a local but not a global scale, or that there are multiple independent sources of global polarity information. Eliminating Fz6 in most hair follicle cells or in the inter-follicular epidermis at E15. 5 suggests that PCP signaling in developing follicles is not required to maintain their orientation. The asymmetric arrangement of Merkel cells around the base of each guard hair follicle dependents on Fz6 expression in the epidermis but not in differentiating Merkel cells. These experiments constrain current models of PCP signaling and the flow of polarity information in mammalian skin.",

Hair follicles (HFs) undergo lifelong cyclical transformations, progressing through stages of rapid growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative \" \" quiescence \" \" (telogen). Given that HF cycling abnormalities underlie many human hair growth disorders, the accurate classification of individual cycle stages within skin biopsies is clinically important and essential for hair research. For preclinical human hair research purposes, human scalp skin can be xenografted onto immunocompromised mice to study human HF cycling and manipulate long-lasting anagen in vivo. Although available for mice, a comprehensive guide on how to recognize different human hair cycle stages in vivo is lacking. In this article, we present such a guide, which uses objective, well-defined, and reproducible criteria, and integrates simple morphological indicators with advanced, (immuno)-histochemical markers. This guide also characterizes human HF cycling in xenografts and highlights the utility of this model for in vivo hair research. Detailed schematic drawings and representative micrographs provide examples of how best to identify human HF stages, even in suboptimally sectioned tissue, and practical recommendations are given for designing human-on-mouse hair cycle experiments. Thus, this guide seeks to offer a benchmark for human hair cycle stage classification, for both hair research experts and newcomers to the field. \"",

    "text": "Alterations in Hair Follicle Morphology and Hair Shaft Production After Follicular Unit Transplantation. Follicular unit transplantation is the most commonly performed technique in modern restorative hair transplantation surgery. It relies on the acquisition of intact follicular units from microdissected scalp skin strips and their subsequent transplantation into the recipient regions affected by alopecia. Ideally, the translocation of follicular units from the balding-resistant areas of the scalp (usually the occipital region) to the recipient site should not result in any morphological change in the grafts. Nevertheless, the insults associated with surgical intervention present grafted follicles to mechanical and chemical cues differently from those of the physiological steady-state conditions in undamaged skin. This disruption of the normal follicular microenvironment might alter important aspects of hair biology in grafts, for example, hair cycle and pigmentation, and, in turn, could lead to differences in hair appearance, eventually culminating in a diminished esthetical outcome of the surgery. In this study, the authors analyzed native and grafted scalp hair follicles (HFs) from 2 patients who had undergone follicular unit transplantation surgeries formerly. Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy-based histomorphometry revealed a marked enlargement of follicular structures in the grafts with a concomitant increase in hair shaft diameter. Immunohistological staining confirmed a thickening of the dermal sheath in transplanted HFs that also harbored a denser vascular network. Taken together, these results show that the grafted HFs analyzed were subjected to marked morphological changes during their residence in the recipient site and that this phenomenon is associated with a modulation of follicular vascularization.",

How stem cells maintain their identity and potency as tissues change during growth is not well understood. In mammalian hair, it is unclear how hair follicle stem cells can enter an extended period of quiescence during the resting phase but retain stem cell potential and be subsequently activated for growth. Here, we use lineage tracing and gene expression mapping to show that the Wnt target gene Axin2 is constantly expressed throughout the hair cycle quiescent phase in outer bulge stem cells that produce their own Wnt signals. Ablating Wnt signaling in the bulge cells causes them to lose their stem cell potency to contribute to hair growth and undergo premature differentiation instead. Bulge cells express secreted Wnt inhibitors, including Dickkopf (Dkk) and secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (Sfrp1). However, the Dickkopf 3 (Dkk3) protein becomes localized to the Wnt-inactive inner bulge that contains differentiated cells. We find that Axin2 expression remains confined to the outer bulge, whereas Dkk3 continues to be localized to the inner bulge during the hair cycle growth phase. Our data suggest that autocrine Wnt signaling in the outer bulge maintains stem cell potency throughout hair cycle quiescence and growth, whereas paracrine Wnt inhibition of inner bulge cells reinforces differentiation.",

OBJECTIVE: To establish an in vitro culture model of single human hair follicle, and observe their morphological and histological changes. METHODS: Human hair follicles were isolated from the volunteer patients. After dissecting follicles into single, follicles in growth phase were cultured in Williams E without any serum. This experiment included 3 groups: single follicle without sebaceous gland and other surrounding tissue (control group) ; single follicle with sebaceous gland and without the other surrounding tissue (experiment group A) ; single follicles with sebaceous gland and the other surrounding tissue (experiment group B). The survival rate, survival time, growth rate, multiplication capacity and apoptosis of cultured follicles and their morphological and histological changes were observed sequentially. RESULTS: The hair follicles in experiment groups showed a better viability and a higher growth rate than those in control group.

Oral epithelia protect against constant challenges by bacteria, viruses, toxins and injury while also contributing to the formation of ectodermal appendages such as teeth, salivary glands and lingual papillae. Despite increasing evidence that differentiation pathway genes are frequently mutated in oral cancers, comparatively little is known about the mechanisms that regulate normal oral epithelial development. Here, we characterize oral epithelial stratification and describe multiple distinct functions for the mitotic spindle orientation gene LGN (Gpsm2) in promoting differentiation and tissue patterning in the mouse oral cavity. Similar to its function in epidermis, apically localized LGN directs perpendicular divisions that promote stratification of the palatal, buccogingival and ventral tongue epithelia. Surprisingly, however, in dorsal tongue LGN is predominantly localized basally, circumferentially or bilaterally and promotes planar divisions. Loss of LGN disrupts the organization and morphogenesis of filiform papillae but appears to be dispensable for embryonic hair follicle development. Thus, LGN has crucial tissue-specific functions in patterning surface ectoderm and its appendages by controlling division orientation.",

In our previous work, we found that the Inner Mongolia Arbas Cashmere goat hair follicle stem cells (gHFSCs) can be successfully differentiated into adipocyte, chondrocyte, and osteocyte lineages. In this study, we further examined the expression of the pluripotency and stemness markers Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, AKP, and TERT in gHFSCs by immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, real-time PCR, and Western blot. Immunofluorescent staining showed that the gHFSCs were positive for all five markers. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) further analyzed the positive expression of Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 in the gHFSCs. Compared with Arbas Cashmere goat adipose-derived stem cells (gADSCs) at the mRNA expression level, Oct4 was relatively highly expressed in gHFSCs, 41. 36 times of the gADSCs, and Nanog was 5. 61, AKP was 2. 74, and TERT was 2. 10 times, respectively (p < 0. 01). Western blot indicated that all markers are expressed at the protein level in the gHFSCs. When compared with gADSCs, using alpha-tubulin as a reference protein, gray intensity analysis showed that the expression of Oct4, Nanog, AKP, and TERT were, respectively, 5. 94, 10. 78, 1. 33, and 1. 39 times of gADSCs.

Differentiation to cardiac-muscle cells from HAP stem cells in cultured whiskers in 4-week-old mice was significantly greater than in 10-, 20-, and 40-week-old mice. There was a strong decrease in differentiation potential of HAP stem cells to cardiac-muscle cells by 10 weeks of age. In contrast, the differentiation potential of HAP stem cells to other cell types did not decrease with age.

Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) undergo cyclical activation and quiescence together with hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). This process is strictly controlled by the autonomous and extrinsic signaling environment. However, the modulation of factors important for the activation of McSCs for hair pigmentation remains unclear. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) mimics vital signaling pathways involved in melanocyte growth and melanogenesis in vitro. To investigate whether TPA regulates quiescent McSCs for hair pigmentation, we topically smeared TPA on 7-week-old mouse dorsal skin and found that TPA stimulated hair growth and hair matrix pigmentation. These changes were associated with a significant increase in the number of hair bulb melanocytes. Moreover, in the TPA-treated group, hair bulge McSCs and hair bulb melanoblasts actively proliferated. At the molecular level, nuclear beta-catenin, a key factor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, was highly synthesized in melanocytes and keratinocytes in TPA-induced hair bulbs. Inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by injecting Dickkopf1 plasmids into TPA-treated skin decreased hair matrix pigmentation and inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of McSCs. Our findings suggest that the topical application of TPA stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of McSCs and their progeny for hair matrix pigmentation by activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. This might provide a useful experimental model for the study of signals controlling the activation of McSCs.",

BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to create a xenogeneic cell scaffold complex with rabbit bladder acellular matrix and rat hair follicle stem cells, to study the feasibility of construct tissue engineer bladder through biocompatibility of hair follicle stem cells and heterogeneous bladder acellular matrix. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New Zealand rabbit bladder acellular matrix was prepared. Scanning electron microscope and Masson staining were used to analyse the acellular material. Two-steps precipitation method was used to place the third generation of hair follicle stem cells onto the surface of the bladder acellular matrix. The in vitro cell growth on the scaffold complex was regularly monitored through an inverted microscope. Cell growth curve was established and histological examination and scanning electron microscopic were used to analyse the progresses of the cell growth on the matrix material. RESULTS: The prepared bladder acellular matrix was white, translucent and membranous. It possessed a fibrous network and collagen structure without any significant cell residues as displayed by the scanning electron microscope, and Masson staining. After 48 h of culture, observation by inverted microscope showed that the hair follicle stem cells grew well around the bladder acellular matrix. After 1 week of culture, scanning electron microscopy showed that the hair follicle stem cells spread and adhered on the surface of the scaffold. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro culture of rat hair follicle stem cells and the rabbit bladder acellular matrix possessed a good biocompatibility, which provides a good experiment support for hair follicle stem cells to repair the bladder defects disease.",

Interfollicular epidermal (IFE) homeostasis is a major physiological process allowing maintenance of the skin barrier function. Despite progress in our understanding of stem cell populations in different hair follicle compartments, cellular mechanisms of IFE maintenance, in particular, whether a hierarchy of progenitors exists within this compartment, have remained controversial. We here used multicolour lineage tracing with Brainbow transgenic labels activated in the epidermis to track individual keratinocyte clones. Two modes of clonal progression could be observed in the adult murine dorsal skin. Clones attached to hair follicles showed rapid increase in size during the growth phase of the hair cycle. On the other hand, clones distant from hair follicles were slow cycling, but could be mobilized by a proliferative stimulus. Reinforced by mathematical modelling, these data support a model where progenitor cycling characteristics are differentially regulated in areas surrounding or away from growing hair follicles. Thus, while IFE progenitors follow a non-hierarchical mode of development, spatiotemporal control by their environment can change their potentialities, with far-reaching implications for epidermal homeostasis, wound repair and cancer development.",

Cell proliferation is essential to rapid tissue growth and repair, but can result in replication-associated genome damage. Here, we implicate the transcription factor Gata6 in adult mouse hair follicle regeneration where it controls the renewal of rapidly proliferating epithelial (matrix) progenitors and hence the extent of production of terminally differentiated lineages. We find that Gata6 protects against DNA damage associated with proliferation, thus preventing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that in vivo Gata6 stimulates EDA-receptor signaling adaptor Edaradd level and NF-kappaB pathway activation, known to be important for DNA damage repair and stress response in general and for hair follicle growth in particular. In cultured keratinocytes, Edaradd rescues DNA damage, cell survival, and proliferation of Gata6 knockout cells and restores MCM10 expression. Our data add to recent evidence in embryonic stem and neural progenitor cells, suggesting a model whereby developmentally regulated transcription factors protect from DNA damage associated with proliferation at key stages of rapid tissue growth.

Understanding how complex tissues are formed, maintained, and regenerated through local growth, differentiation, and remodeling requires knowledge on how single-cell behaviors are coordinated on the population level. The self-renewing hair follicle, maintained by a distinct stem cell population, represents an excellent paradigm to address this question. A major obstacle in mechanistic understanding of hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) regulation has been the lack of a culture system that recapitulates HFSC behavior while allowing their precise monitoring and manipulation. Here, we establish an in vitro culture system based on a 3D extracellular matrix environment and defined soluble factors, which for the first time allows expansion and long-term maintenance of murine multipotent HFSCs in the absence of heterologous cell types. Strikingly, this scheme promotes de novo generation of HFSCs from non-HFSCs and vice versa in a dynamic self-organizing process. This bidirectional interconversion of HFSCs and their progeny drives the system into a population equilibrium state. Our study uncovers regulatory dynamics by which phenotypic plasticity of cells drives population-level homeostasis within a niche, and provides a discovery tool for studies on adult stem cell fate.",

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are required to establish immune tolerance to commensal microbes. Tregs accumulate abruptly in the skin during a defined window of postnatal tissue development. However, the mechanisms mediating Treg migration to neonatal skin are unknown. Here we show that hair follicle (HF) development facilitates the accumulation of Tregs in neonatal skin and that upon skin entry these cells localize to HFs, a primary reservoir for skin commensals. Further, germ-free neonates had reduced skin Tregs indicating that commensal microbes augment Treg accumulation. We identified Ccl20 as a HF-derived, microbiota-dependent chemokine and found its receptor, Ccr6, to be preferentially expressed by Tregs in neonatal skin. The Ccl20-Ccr6 pathway mediated Treg migration in vitro and in vivo. Thus, HF morphogenesis, commensal microbe colonization, and local chemokine production work in concert to recruit Tregs into neonatal skin, thereby establishing this tissue Treg niche early in life.",

The macromolecular precursors are labeled with a pH sensitive indodicarbocyanine dye (pH-IDCC) and a control dye (indocarbocyanine dye: ICC) and crosslinked via a mild and surfactant-free Thiol-Michael reaction using an inverse nanoprecipitation method. With this method, it is possible to prepare tailor-made particles in the range of 100 nm to 1 microm with a narrow polydispersity. The dPG-NGs are characterized using dynamic light scattering, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and atomic force microscopy. Systematic analysis of confocal microscope images of histological sections of the skin enables accurate determination of the pH gradient inside the HF.

BACKGROUND: Stem cells are characterized by self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. The bulge hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are able to convert to epithelial components. The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1, 25 (OH) 2D3, plays important roles in this differentiation process. In the present study has found that 1, 25 (OH) 2D3 induces the HFSCs differentiation into keratinocyte. METHODS: HFSCs are isolated from rat whiskers and cultivated in DMEM medium. To isolate bulge stem cell population, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry using K15, CD34 and nestin biomarkers were performed. In order to accelerate the HFSCs differentiation into eratinocyte, HFSCs were treated with 10-12 M, 1, 25 (OH) 2D3 every 48 h for a week. RESULTS: Immunocytochemistry results showed that bulge stem cells are nestin and CD34 positive but K15 negative before differentiation. Subsequently flow cytometry results, showed that the expression of nestin, CD34 and K15 were 70. 96%, 93. 03% and 6. 88% respectively. After differentiation, the immunocytochemical and flow cytometry results indicated that differentiated cells have positive reaction to K15 with 68. 94% expression level.

A specialized quiescent population of hair follicle stem cells, residing in the hair follicle outer root sheath cells (ORSCs), has previously demonstrated pluripotency for differentiation into neural stem cells (NSCs). A previous study indicated that nestin-positive hair follicle ORSCs are able to differentiate into neurons. However, little has been reported on the isolation of nestin-negative human ORSCs and whether they can successfully differentiate into neurons in vitro. In the present study, nestin-positive ORSCs were significantly reduced with a prolonged incubation time in vitro. Following 9 days of primary culture, nestin-expressing ORSCs disappeared entirely, and ORSCs remained nestin-negative following 5 days of subculture. Notably, nestin was identified in ORSCs following a three-step process of neuro-induction. In addition, neruodevelopmental markers were detected in the ORSC-derived nestin-positive spherical cell mass, including the induction of the neuronal specific markers growth associated protein-43, neurotensin receptor-3 and p75 neurotrophin receptor, and also the gliocyte markers, glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100. These sphere-forming cells did not express the mature neuron-associated markers neurofilament medium, neuronal nuclei and neuron-specific enolase, which suggested that sphere-forming cells may preferentially differentiate into neural stem cell-like cells as opposed to mature neurons or neurogliocyte. In conclusion, ORSC-driven neural differentiation may be a suitable treatment strategy for neurodegenerative diseases and may possess an important value in regenerative medicine.",

The cell surface protein Stem Cell Antigen-1 (Sca-1) marks stem or progenitor cells in several murine tissues and is normally upregulated during cancer development. Although the specific function of Sca-1 remains unknown, Sca-1 seems to play a role in proliferation, differentiation and cell migration in a number of tissues. In the skin epithelium, Sca-1 is highly expressed in the interfollicular epidermis but is absent in most compartments of the hair follicle ; however, the function of Sca-1 in the skin has not been investigated. To explore the role of Sca-1 in normal and malignant skin development we generated transgenic mice that express Sca-1 in the hair follicle stem cells that are normally Sca-1 negative. Development of hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis appeared normal in Sca-1 mutant mice ; however, follicular induction of Sca-1 expression in bulge region and isthmus stem cells reduced the overall yield of papillomas in a chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Despite that fewer papillomas developed in transgenic mice a higher proportion of the papillomas underwent malignant conversion. These findings suggest that overexpression of Sca-1 in the hair follicle stem cells contributes at different stages of tumour development. In early stages, overexpression of Sca-1 decreases tumour formation while at later stages overexpression of Sca-1 seems to drive tumours towards malignant progression.",

Using NF-kappaB reporter mouse models, strong NF-kappaB activity was detected in the secondary hair germ of late telogen and early anagen HFs, suggesting a potential role for NF-kappaB in HF stem/progenitor cell activation during anagen induction. At mid-anagen, NF-kappaB activity was observed in the inner root sheath and unilaterally clustered in the HF matrix, which indicates that NF-kappaB activity is also involved in hair fiber morphogenesis during HF cycling. A mouse model with inducible NF-kappaB suppression in the epithelium revealed pelage hair-type-dependent functions of NF-kappaB in cycling HFs. NF-kappaB participates in telogen-anagen transition in awl and zigzag HFs, and is required for zigzag hair bending and guard HF cycling. Interestingly, zigzag hair shaft bending depends on noncanonical NF-kappaB signaling, which previously has only been associated with lymphoid cell biology. Furthermore, loss of guard HF cycling suggests that in this particular hair type, NF-kappaB is indispensable for stem cell activation, maintenance, and/or growth.",

Skin permeation was conducted by in vitro Franz diffusion cell. The anti-MRSA potential was checked using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), a well diffusion test, and intracellular MRSA killing. The classic, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), and deoxycholic acid (DA) liposomes had a vesicle size of 98, 132, and 239 nm, respectively. The incorporation of DMPC or DA into the liposomes increased the bilayer fluidity. The malleable vesicles containing DMPC and DA showed increased follicular Cm uptake over the control solution by 1. 5-and 2-fold, respectively. The MIC and MBC of DA liposomes loaded with Cm were 62. 5 and 62. 5-125 mug/mL, comparable to free Cm. An inhibition zone about 2-fold higher was achieved by DA liposomes as compared to the free control at a Cm dose of 0. 5 mg/mL. DA liposomes also augmented antibacterial activity on keratinocyte-infected MRSA. The deformable liposomes had good biocompatibility against keratinocytes and neutrophils (viability > 80%). In vivo administration demonstrated that DA liposomes caused negligible toxicity on the skin, based on physiological examination and histology. These data suggest the potential application of malleable liposomes for follicular targeting and the treatment of MRSA-infected dermatologic conditions.",

Both gene differential expression (DE) and gene set (GS) analyses were conducted using hair follicle transcriptome established from pre and postexercise subjects upon a 10-day HIIT program by RNA-Seq, Comparing between pre and posttraining groups, differentially expressed protein coding genes were identified. To interpret the functional significance of the DE results, a comprehensive GS analysis approach featuring multiple algorithms was used to enrich gene ontology (GO) terms and KEGG pathways. The GS analysis revealed enriched themes such as energy metabolism, cell proliferation/growth/survival, muscle adaptations, and cytokine-cytokine interaction, all of which have been previously proposed as HIIT responses. Moreover, related cell signaling pathways were also measured. Specifically, G-protein-mediated signal transduction, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)-protein kinase B (PKB) and Janus kinase (JAK)-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) signaling cascades were over-represented.

OBJECTIVE: Hair loss generates severe psychosocial implications. To date, exploring the prognostic factors of possible clinical benefit of autologous blood concentrate platelet rich plasma (PRP) was failed. The aim of our pilot study was to explore the correlation between the individual inflammation genetic profile and PRP efficacy in the treatment of hair follicle regeneration. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 41 volunteers (25 men, 16 women) took part in this retrospective study. All the patients were scheduled for 4 sessions of PRP application with intervals of 40-60 days. All the patients were checked up at 6 weekly intervals for 6 months and, then, at the end of the first year. A panel of 5 polymorphisms on 4 genes (IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-10) implicated in the individual genetic inflammation profile were performed. RESULTS: A significant increase rate in hair density was noticed after the third month of treatment in 32/41 (78%) of the subjects. We found an interesting association between the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1alpha polymorphism C > A (rs17561) and responders to PRP treatment. The cases carrying C/C genotype (coding for Ser114) were 21 (66%) in responders and only 2 (22%) in non-responders (p < 0. 05). In addition, about IL-1a, the frequency of G/G genotype in responder patients was over two times lower in responder (31%) than in non-responder patients (78%). CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study demonstrated a correlation between the individual genetic inflammatory profile and the efficacy of the PRP treatment in males. On the contrary, in females, it showed a negative correlation. IL-1a could be used as a prognostic value for PRP efficacy. Also, these results provide preliminary evidence that may encourage the design of controlled clinical trials to properly test this modus operandi on a large number of subjects.",

Hair follicle is a mini-organ that consists of complex but well-organized structures, which are differentiated from hair follicle progenitor or stem cells. How non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway is involved in regulating hair follicle differentiation remains elusive. Here we showed that Wnt5a regulates hair follicle differentiation through an epithelial-mesenchymal interaction mechanism in mice. We first observed that Wnt5a is expressed in the epithelial and dermal papilla cells during hair follicle development and growth. For the upstream of Wnt5a, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry staining showed that Wnt5a expression is significantly decreased in the Gsdma3-mutant mice in vivo. Overexpression of Gsdma3 results in a significantly increased expression of Wnt5a in the cultured epidermal cells in vitro. We also checked the downstream factors of Wnt5a by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Wnt5a to the dermal papilla cells isolated from the mouse whisker. We found that overexpression of Wnt5a suppresses canonical Wnt signaling pathway effectors such as beta-catenin and Lef1. In addition, genes involved in maintaining cell quiescent state are also significantly decreased in their expression to the DP cells which were treated by Wnt5a. Our study indicates that Wnt5a mediates epithelia-expressed Gsdma3 to influence DP cell behaviors, which in turn regulate hair follicle epithelia differentiation in mice.",

Hair follicle regeneration is dependent on reciprocal signaling between epithelial cells and underlying mesenchymal cells within the dermal papilla. Hair follicle dermal stem cells reside within the hair follicle mesenchyme, self-renew in vivo, and function to repopulate the dermal papilla and regenerate the connective tissue sheath with each hair cycle. The identity and temporal pattern of signals that regulate hair follicle dermal stem cell function are not known. Here, we show that platelet-derived growth factor signaling is crucial for hair follicle dermal stem cell function and platelet-derived growth factor deficiency results in a progressive depletion of the hair follicle dermal stem cell pool and their progeny. Using alphaSMACreERT2: RosaYFP: Pdgfralphaflox mice, we ablated Pdgfralpha specifically within the adult hair follicle dermal stem cell lineage. This led to significant loss of hair follicle dermal stem cell progeny in connective tissue sheath and dermal papilla of individual follicles, and a progressive reduction in total number of anagen hair follicles containing YFP + ve cells. As well, over successive hair cycles, fewer hair follicle dermal stem cells were retained within each telogen hair follicle suggesting an impact on hair follicle dermal stem cell self-renewal. To further assess this, we grew prospectively isolated hair follicle dermal stem cells (Sox2GFP + ve alphaSMAdsRed + ve) in the presence or absence of platelet-derived growth factor ligands. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB enhanced proliferation, increased the frequency of Sox2 + ve hair follicle dermal stem cell progeny and improved inductive capacity of hair follicle dermal stem cells in an ex vivo hair follicle formation assay. Similar effects on proliferation were observed in adult human SKPs. Our findings impart novel insights into the signals that comprise the adult hair follicle dermal stem cell niche and suggest that platelet-derived growth factor signaling promotes self renewal, is essential to maintain the hair follicle dermal stem cell pool and ultimately their regenerative capacity within the hair follicle.",

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as non-coding transcripts (> 200 nucleotides) that serve important roles in the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells. Hair follicle stem cells (HFTs) have multidirectional differentiation potential and are able to differentiate into skin, hair follicles and sebaceous glands, serving a role in skin wound healing. The aim of the present study was to analyze the regulatory role of lncRNA AK015322 (IncRNA5322) in HFTs and the potential mechanism of IncRNA5322-mediated differentiation of HFTs. The results demonstrated that lncRNA5322 transfection promoted proliferation and differentiation in HFTs. It was identified that lncRNA5322 transfection upregulated the expression and phosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) in HFTs. It was also observed that lncRNA5322 transfection upregulated microRNA (miR)-21 and miR-21 agonist (agomir-21) eliminated lncRNA5322-induced expression and phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. The present study also demonstrated that agomir-21 blocked IncRNA5322-induced expression and phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT in HFTs. The results indicated that agomir-21 transfection also suppressed the IncRNA5322-induced proliferation and differentiation of HFTs. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that lncRNA5322 is able to promote the proliferation and differentiation of HFTs by targeting the miR-21-mediated PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in HFTs.",

    "text": "T helper 17 cell/regulatory T-cell imbalance in hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa: the link to hair follicle dissection, obesity, smoking and autoimmune comorbidities. BACKGROUND: Disintegration of the infundibula of terminal hair follicles (HFs) in intertriginous skin areas exhibits the histological hallmark of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)/acne inversa, featuring a dissecting terminal hair folliculitis. Elevated serum levels of interleukin (IL)-17 and local increase in the ratio of proinflammatory T helper (Th) 17 cells and anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been reported. Perifollicular Tregs play a key role in HF stem cell homeostasis and infundibular integrity. OBJECTIVES: In this review, we evaluate the Th17/Treg ratio in HS, its aggravating conditions and associated comorbidities. Furthermore, we intended to clarify whether drugs with reported beneficial effects in the treatment of HS readjust the deviated Th17/Treg axis. METHODS: PubMed-listed, peer-reviewed original research articles characterizing Th17/Treg regulation in HS/acne inversa and associated comorbidities were selected for this review. RESULTS: This review presents HS as a disease that exhibits an increased Th17/Treg ratio. Perifollicular deficiencies in Treg numbers or function may disturb HF stem cell homeostasis, initiating infundibular dissection of terminal HFs and perifollicular inflammation. The Th17/Treg imbalance is aggravated by obesity, smoking and decreased Notch signalling. In addition, HS-associated autoimmune diseases exhibit a disturbed Th17/Treg axis resulting in a Th17-dominant state. All drugs that have beneficial effects in the treatment of HS normalize the Th17/Treg ratio. CONCLUSIONS: HS immunopathogenesis is closely related to deviations of the Th17/Treg balance, which may negatively affect Treg-controlled HF stem cell homeostasis and infundibular integrity. Pharmacological intervention should not only attenuate Th17/IL-17 signalling, but should also improve Treg function in order to stabilize HF stem cell homeostasis and infundibular integrity.",

    "text": "Integrative analysis reveals ncRNA-mediated molecular regulatory network driving secondary hair follicle regression in cashmere goats. BACKGROUND: Cashmere is a keratinized product derived from the secondary hair follicles (SHFs) of cashmere goat skins. The cashmere fiber stops growing following the transition from the actively proliferating anagen stage to the apoptosis-driven catagen stage. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of apoptosis in SHFs, especially as pertains to the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and their interactions with other molecules. Hair follicle (HF) degeneration is caused by localized apoptosis in the skin, while anti-apoptosis pathways may coexist in adjacent HFs. Thus, elucidating the molecular interactions responsible for apoptosis and anti-apoptosis in the skin will provide insights into HF regression. RESULTS: We used multiple-omics approaches to systematically identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs expressed in cashmere goat skins in two crucial phases (catagen vs. anagen) of HF growth. Skin samples were collected from three cashmere goats at the anagen (September) and catagen (February) stages, and six lncRNA libraries and six miRNA libraries were constructed for further analysis. We identified 1122 known and 403 novel lncRNAs in the goat skins, 173 of which were differentially expressed between the anagen and catagen stages. We further identified 3500 gene-encoding transcripts that were differentially expressed between these two phases. We also identified 411 known miRNAs and 307 novel miRNAs, including 72 differentially expressed miRNAs. We further investigated the target genes of lncRNAs via both cis-and trans-regulation during HF growth. Our data suggest that lncRNAs and miRNAs act synergistically in the HF growth transition, and the catagen inducer factors (TGFbeta1 and BDNF) were regulated by miR-873 and lnc108635596 in the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks. CONCLUSION: This study enriches the repertoire of ncRNAs in goats and other mammals, and contributes to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of ncRNAs involved in the regulation of HF growth and regression in goats and other hair-producing species.",

However, the role of autophagy in human physiology is poorly understood, highlighting a need for a model human organ system to assess the efficacy and safety of strategies to therapeutically modulate autophagy. As a complete, cyclically remodelled (mini-) organ, the organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs), which, after massive growth (anagen), spontaneously enter into an apoptosis-driven organ involution (catagen) process, may provide such a model. Here, we reveal that in anagen, hair matrix keratinocytes (MKs) of organ-cultured HFs exhibit an active autophagic flux, as documented by evaluation of endogenous lipidated Light Chain 3B (LC3B) and sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) proteins and the ultrastructural visualization of autophagosomes at all stages of the autophagy process. This autophagic flux is altered during catagen, and genetic inhibition of autophagy promotes catagen development. Conversely, an anti-hair loss product markedly enhances intrafollicular autophagy, leading to anagen prolongation. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role of autophagy in human hair growth. Moreover, we show that organ-cultured scalp HFs are an excellent preclinical research model for exploring the role of autophagy in human tissue physiology and for evaluating the efficacy and tissue toxicity of candidate autophagy-modulatory agents in a living human (mini-) organ.",

Recent studies have demonstrated significant influences of posttranscriptional regulation by microRNA (miRNA) on HF development. The current study aims to investigate how miRNAs regulate Wnt/beta-catenin to control HF inductivity of DP cells by performing microarray analysis in early-and late-passage DP cells and transfecting with miRNAs inhibitor or mimic. Results showed early-passage DP cells strongly expressed miRNAs related to inhibition of noncanonical Wnt pathways. In late-passage DP cells, miRNAs capable of inhibiting the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were upregulated, in addition to the miRNAs targeting the noncanonical Wnt pathway. Moreover, we verified that beta-catenin expression was downregulated by miR-195-5p overexpression in dose manner. Meanwhile LRP6 expression was downregulated in both protein and mRNA as well as the genes involved in the hair inductivity of DP cells.

Neural crest stem cells that located in the postnatal hair follicle (HF-NCSC) are considered a promising tool for treatment of nervous system diseases and injuries. It is well known that HF-NCSC can be used in the spinal cord and sciatic nerve reparation but their ability to restore brain structures is poorly studied. In this article we are investigating the interaction between HF-NCSC and a nerve tissue (embryonic and adult). We have found out that HF-NCSC isolated from adult mice grow and differentiate in accordance with the mouse embryo developmental stage when co-cultured with the embryonic nerve tissue. The HF-NCSC migration is slower in the late embryonic tissue co-culture system compared to the early one. This phenomenon is related to the motor function of the cells but not to their proliferation level. We have demonstrated that the embryonic nerve tissue maintains HF-NCSC an undifferentiated status, while an adult brain tissue inhibits the cell proliferation and activates the differentiation processes. Besides, HF-NCSC pre-differentiated into the neuronal direction shows a higher survival and migration rate after the transplantation into the adult brain tissue compared to the undifferentiated HF-NCSC. Thus, we have investigated the postnatal HF-NCSC response to the nerve tissue microenvironment to analyze their possible application to the brain repair processes.",

Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing and in vivo methods, we infer a sequence of transcriptional states through which DC cells pass that begins prior to HF morphogenesis. Our data indicate that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is required to progress into an intermediate stage that precedes quiescence and differentiation. Further, we provide evidence that quiescent DC cells are recent progeny of selectively proliferating cells present prior to morphogenesis and that are later identified in the peri-DC zone during DC expansion.

    "text": "OCT4 maintains self-renewal and reverses senescence in human hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells through the downregulation of p21 by DNA methyltransferases. BACKGROUND: Self-renewal is dependent on an intrinsic gene regulatory network centered on OCT4 and on an atypical cell cycle G1/S transition, which is also regulated by OCT4. p21, a gene negatively associated with self-renewal and a senescence marker, is a member of the universal cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) and plays critical roles in the regulation of the G1/S transition. The expression of p21 can be regulated by OCT4-targeted DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which play distinct roles in gene regulation and maintaining pluripotency properties. The aim of this study was to determine the role of OCT4 in the regulation of self-renewal and senescence in human hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells (hHFMSCs) and to characterize the molecular mechanisms involved. METHODS: A lentiviral vector was used to ectopically express OCT4. The influences of OCT4 on the self-renewal and senescence of hHFMSCs were investigated. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to identify the downstream genes of OCT4 in this process. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis was performed to measure the methylation level of the p21 promoter region. p21 was overexpressed in hHFMSCsOCT4 to test its downstream effect on OCT4. The regulatory effect of OCT4 on DNMTs was examined by ChIP assay. 5-aza-dC/zebularine was used to inhibit the expression of DNMTs, and then self-renewal properties and senescence in hHFMSCs were detected. RESULTS: The overexpression of OCT4 promoted proliferation, cell cycle progression, and osteogenic differentiation capacity of hHFMSCs. The cell senescence of hHFMSCs was markedly suppressed due to the ectopic expression of OCT4. Through NGS, we identified 2466 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between hHFMSCsOCT4 and hHFMSCsEGFP, including p21, which was downregulated. The overexpression of p21 abrogated the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation capacity of hHFMSCsOCT4 and promoted cell senescence. OCT4 enhanced the transcription of DNMT genes, leading to an elevation in the methylation of the p21 promoter. The inhibition of DNMTs reversed the OCT4-induced p21 reduction, depleted the self-renewal of hHFMSCsOCT4, and triggered cell senescence. CONCLUSIONS: OCT4 maintains the self-renewal ability of hHFMSCs and reverses senescence by suppressing the expression of p21 through the upregulation of DNMTs.",

BACKGROUND: Hair follicle (HF) cycling is dependent upon activation and differentiation of an epithelial subpopulation of cells with stem-like characteristics. These cells express cytokeratin 15 (CK15) and are sequestered within a specialized niche termed the follicular bulge. The pathways that mediate bulge activation are poorly understood, although growing evidence suggests a role for epigenetic events. METHODS: Here we investigated murine and human HFs to determine whether a recently described epigenetic hydroxymethylation marker, 5-hmC, known to mediate cell growth and differentiation, may play a role in bulge activation. RESULTS: We found the bulge region of murine HFs to show variable 5-hmC distribution within the nuclei of CK15-positive stem cells during early anagen, a pattern that was not associated with resting stem cells of telogen follicles, which did not express 5-hmC. Moreover, during phases of early anagen that were induced in an organ culture model, spatial alterations in bulge stem cell 5-hmC reactivity, as assessed by dual labeling, were noted. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that 5-hmC may play a dynamic role in bulge activation during anagen growth, and provide a foundation for further experimental inquiry into epigenomic regulation of HF stem cells.",

Merkel discs, located in skin touch domes and whisker hair follicles, are tactile end organs essential for environmental exploration, social interaction, and tactile discrimination. Recent studies from our group and two others have shown that mechanical stimulation excites Merkel cells via Piezo2 channel activation to subsequently activate sensory neural pathways. We have further shown that mechanical stimulation leads to the release of 5-HT from Merkel cells to synaptically transmit tactile signals to whisker afferent nerves. However, a more recent study using skin touch domes has raised the possibility that Merkel discs are adrenergic synapses. It was proposed that norepinephrine is released from Merkel cells upon mechanical stimulation to subsequently activate beta2 adrenergic receptors on Merkel disc nerve endings leading to nerve impulses. In the present study, we examined effects of norepinephrine and beta2 adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118, 551 on Merkel disc mechanoreceptors in mouse whisker hair follicles. We show that norepinephrine did not directly induce impulses from Merkel disc mechanoreceptors. Furthermore, we found that ICI 118, 551 at 50 muM inhibited voltage-gated Na + channels and suppressed impulses of Merkel disc mechanoreceptors, but ICI 118, 551 at 1 muM had no effects on the impulse.

BACKGROUND: Despite advances in medical treatments, the proportion of the population suffering from alopecia is increasing, creating a need for new treatments to control hair loss and prevent balding. Treatments based on plant-derived compounds could potentially prevent hair loss. Human hair follicle dermal papilla (HDP) cells, a type of specialized fibroblast in the hair bulb, play an essential role in controlling hair growth and in conditions such as androgenic alopecia. We examined the effect of Bacillus/Trapa japonica fruit ferment filtrate extracts (TJFs) on HDP cells to determine whether activation of the Akt/ERK/GSK-3beta signaling pathway improved HDP cell proliferation. METHODS: We prepared TJFs using various methods. The extract properties were analyzed using WST-1, Lowry, and cell migration assays as well as immunofluorescence staining. We also determined the cell cycle stage and performed western blotting and an in ovo chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Last, we constructed an organotypic three-dimensional cell culture model for immunohistochemical use. RESULTS: Our study confirmed that the TJFs contained numerous peptides and five unknown fractions. The TJFs stimulated HDP cell proliferation and migration via the Akt/ERK/GSK-3beta signaling pathway. To verify that the Akt/ERK/GSK-3beta pathway affected HDP cell proliferation, we treated HDP cells with LY294002 (an Akt inhibitor), BIO (a GSK-3beta inhibitor), and PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor). The TJFs also induced cell cycle progression, inhibited type I 5alpha-reductase, decreased apoptosis, and enhanced angiogenesis (vascular expansion). In addition to these signaling pathways, proteins including insulin-like growth factor-1 and keratinocyte growth factor, stimulating hair growth, were detected in the three-dimensional cell culture model. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that TJFs enhance HDP cell proliferation via the Akt/ERK/GSK-3beta signaling pathway, suggesting a potential treatment for alopecia.",

The present study examined the hypothesis that the application of simvastatin would induce the HFSCs differentiation into keratinocyte. Methods: The bulge of the hair follicle was anatomized, and HFSCs were cultivated. The flow cytometry and immunocytochemical staining for detection of nestin, CD34, and Kr15 biomarkers were performed before differentiation. In order to hasten the HFSCs differentiation to keratinocyte, HFSCs were treated with 1 microM, 2 microM, and 5 microM of simvastatin daily for a week. After differentiation, the flow cytometry and immunocytochemical staining were performed with Kr15 and Kr10 biomarkers, and the MTT assay was carried out as an index of cell viability and cell growth. Results: Our results showed that bulge of HFSCs were nestin and CD34 positive and Kr15 negative. Simvastatin significantly increased the viability of HFSCs (p < 0. 05) at the concentration of 5 microM. In addition, the percentages of keratinocyte-differentiated cells treated with 5 microM of simvastatin showed a significant increase compared to all other treated groups (p < 0. 05).

Using both in vitro and ex vivo models of human skin wound closure, we found that hair follicle dermal papilla fibroblasts could accelerate closure of in vitro scratch wounds by 1. 8-fold and epithelial growth capacity by 1. 5-fold compared with controls (P < 0. 05). We used a cytokine array to determine how the dermal papilla fibroblasts were eliciting this effect and identified two cytokines, sAXL and CCL19, that are released at significantly higher levels by follicular fibroblasts than by interfollicular subtypes. Using sAXL and CCL19 individually, we found that they could also increase closure of epithelial cells in a scratch wound by 1. 2-and 1. 5-fold, respectively, compared with controls (P < 0. 05).

Stem cells derived from elderly donors or harvested by repeated subculture exhibit a marked decrease in proliferative capacity and multipotency, which not only compromises their therapeutic potential but also raises safety concerns for regenerative medicine. NANOG-a well-known core transcription factor-plays an important role in maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of stem cells. Unfortunately, the mechanism that NANOG delays mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) senescence is not well-known until now. In our study, we showed that both ectopic NANOG expression and PBX1 overexpression (i) significantly upregulated phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and PARP1 ; (ii) promoted cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and osteogenesis ; (iii) reduced the number of senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase-(SA-beta-gal-) positive cells ; and (iv) downregulated the expression of p16, p53, and p21. Western blotting and dual-luciferase activity assays showed that ectopic NANOG expression significantly upregulated PBX1 expression and increased PBX1 promoter activity. In contrast, PBX1 knockdown by RNA interference in hair follicle-(HF-) derived MSCs that were ectopically expressing NANOG resulted in the significant downregulation of p-AKT and the upregulation of p16 and p21. Moreover, blocking AKT with the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 or knocking down AKT via RNA interference significantly decreased PBX1 expression, while increasing p16 and p21 expression and the number of SA-beta-gal-positive cells. In conclusion, our findings show that NANOG delays HF-MSC senescence by upregulating PBX1 and activating AKT signaling and that a feedback loop likely exists between PBX1 and AKT signaling.",

Here, the focus was evaluating the HF uptake provided by such nanoparticles in comparison to a commercial cream and investigating the influence of different physical stimuli [i. e., infrared (IR) irradiation (with and without metallic nanoparticles-MNP), ultrasound (US) (with and without vibration) and mechanical massage] on their follicular targeting potential. Nanosystems presented sizes around 180 nm (PdI < 0. 2) and negative zeta potential. The formulation did not alter skin water loss measurements and was stable for at least 30 days at 5 C. Nanoparticles released the drug in a sustained fashion for more than 3 days and increased passively about 40 times CLO follicular uptake compared to the commercial cream. Confocal images confirmed the enhanced follicular delivery. On the one hand, NLC application followed by IR for heat generation showed no benefit in terms of HF targeting even at higher temperatures generated by metallic nanoparticle heating. On the other hand, upon US treatment, CLO retention was significantly increased in deeper skin layers. The addition of mechanical vibration to the US treatment led to higher follicular accumulation compared to passive exposure to NLC without stimuli. However, from all evaluated stimuli, manual massage presented the highest follicular targeting potential, driving more than double the amount of CLO into the HF than NLC passive application. In conclusion, NLC showed great potential for delivering CLO to HF, and a simple massage was capable of doubling follicular retention.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic mechanisms underlying wool production by characterizing the skin protein profile and determining the proteomic changes that occur as a consequence of development in wool-producing sheep using a label-free proteomics approach. Samples were collected at four stages during gestation (87, 96, 102, and 138 days), and every two consecutive stages were statistically compared (87 versus 96, 96 versus 102, and 102 versus 138 days). We identified 227 specific proteins in the sheep proteome that were present in all four stages, and 123 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs). We also observed that the microstructure of the secondary follicles changed significantly during the development of the fetal skin hair follicle. The screened DAPs were strictly related to metabolic and skin development pathways, and were associated with pathways such as the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. These analyses indicated that the wool production of fine wool sheep is regulated via a variety of pathways. These findings provide an important resource that can be used in future studies of the genetic mechanisms underlying wool traits in fine wool sheep, and the identified DAPs should be further investigated as candidate markers for predicting wool traits in sheep. SIGNIFICANCE: Wool quality (fiber diameter, length, etc.) is an important economic trait of fine wool sheep that is determined by secondary follicle differentiation and re-differentiation. Secondary follicles of fine wool sheep developed from a bud (87 days), and underwent differentiation (96 days) and rapid growth (102 days) until maturity (138 days) during gestation. Comparative analysis based on differential proteomics of these four periods could provide a better understanding of the wool growth mechanism of fine wool sheep and offer novel strategies for improving fine wool quality by breeding.",

    "text": "Dicer-and Bulge Stem Cell-Dependent MicroRNAs During Induced Anagen Hair Follicle Development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a major class of conserved non-coding RNAs that have a wide range of functions during development and disease. Biogenesis of canonical miRNAs depend on the cytoplasmic processing of pre-miRNAs to mature miRNAs by the Dicer endoribonuclease. Once mature miRNAs are generated, the miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), or miRISC, incorporates one strand of miRNAs as a template for recognizing complementary target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to dictate post-transcriptional gene expression. Besides regulating miRNA biogenesis, Dicer is also part of miRISC to assist in activation of the complex. Dicer associates with other regulatory miRISC co-factors such as trans-activation responsive RNA-binding protein 2 (Tarbp2) to regulate miRNA-based RNA interference. Although the functional role of miRNAs within epidermal keratinocytes has been extensively studied within embryonic mouse skin, its contribution to the normal function of hair follicle bulge stem cells (BSCs) during post-natal hair follicle development is unclear. With this question in mind, we sought to ascertain whether Dicer-Tarpb2 plays a functional role within BSCs during induced anagen development by utilizing conditional knockout mouse models. Our findings suggest that Dicer, but not Tarbp2, functions within BSCs to regulate induced anagen (growth phase) development of post-natal hair follicles. These findings strengthen our understanding of miRNA-dependency within hair follicle cells during induced anagen development.",

This likely reflects that the HF epithelium differs from the epidermal barrier in that it provides a moist, less acidic, and relatively ultraviolet light-protected environment, part of which is immune-privileged, thus facilitating microbial survival. Here we review the current understanding of the human HF microbiome and its potential physiological and pathological functions, including in folliculitis, acne vulgaris, hidradenitis suppurativa, alopecia areata and cicatricial alopecias. While reviewing the main human HF bacteria (such as Propionibacteria, Corynebacteria, Staphylococci and Streptococci), viruses, fungi and parasites as human HF microbiome constituents, we advocate a broad view of the HF as an integral part of the human holobiont. Specifically, we explore how the human HF may manage its microbiome via the regulated production of antimicrobial peptides (such as cathelicidin, psoriasin, RNAse7 and dermcidin) by HF keratinocytes, how the microbiome may impact on cytokine and chemokine release from the HF, and examine hair growth-modulatory effects of antibiotics, and ask whether the microbiome affects hair growth in turn.

In this study, we identified that platelet factor 4 (PF4), a component of PRP, significantly suppressed human hair follicle growth and restrained the proliferation of human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs). Furthermore, our results showed that PF4 upregulated androgen receptor (AR) in human dermal papilla cells in vitro and via hair follicle organ culture. Among the hair growth-promoting and DP-signature genes investigated, PF4 decreased the expression of Wnt5a, Wnt10b, LEF1, HEY1 and IGF-1, and increased DKK1 expression, but did not affect BMP2 and BMP4 expression.

BACKGROUND: Vitiligo manifests as hypo-to de-pigmented macules, which are sometimes associated with leukotrichia. For complete cosmetic improvement, the repigmentation of leukotrichia is an important component. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included patients with stable vitiligo with leukotrichia. Two vitiligo patches in each patient were randomized to receive either of the two procedures. The patients were followed up for 9 months posttransplantation. The efficacy of hair follicle cell suspension (HFCS) with epidermal cell suspension (ECS) in repigmentation of leukotrichia and skin in vitiligo was compared. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients underwent the procedure, and 19 completed the follow-up. The area of the vitiligo patch and the number of leukotrichia in the patches were comparable between the two groups. There was a significant difference in the mean +-S. D. number of cells transplanted between the two groups (5. 06 x 105 in HFCS vs. 39. 8 x 105 in ECS, P < 0. 0001). The percentage viability of cells and proportion of melanocytes were comparable between the two groups. A total of 10 patients in HFCS and eight patients in ECS had repigmentation of leukotrichia. The mean +-S. D. percentages of depigmented hair showing repigmentation at nine months were 7. 42 +-11. 62% in HFCS and 11. 42 +-17. 90% in ECS (P = 0. 4195), whereas the mean +-S. D. percentage repigmentation of vitiligo patches was 61. 58 +-42. 68% in HFCS and 78. 68 +-30. 03% in ECS (P = 0. 1618). CONCLUSIONS: The mean number of cells transplanted in the HFCS group was about eight times less than those in ECS.

Many active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) possess poor aqueous solubility and thus lead to poor bioavailability upon oral administration and topical application. Nanocrystals have a well-established, universal formulation approach to overcome poor solubility. Various nanocrystal-based products have entered the market for oral application. However, their use in dermal formulations is relatively novel. Previous studies confirmed that nanocrystals are a superior formulation principle to improve the dermal penetration of poorly soluble API. Other studies showed that nanocrystals can also be used to target the hair follicles where they create a drug depot, enabling long acting drug therapy with only one application. Very recent studies show that also the vehicle in which the nanocrystals are incorporated can have a tremendous influence on the pathway of the API and the nanocrystals. In order to elucidate the influence of the excipient in more detail, a systematic study was conducted to investigate the influence of excipients on the penetration efficacy of the formulated API and the pathway of nanocrystals upon dermal application. Results showed that already small quantities of excipients can strongly affect the passive dermal penetration of curcumin and the hair follicle targeting of curcumin nanocrystals. The addition of 2% ethanol promoted hair follicle targeting of nanocrystals and hampered passive diffusion into the stratum corneum of the API, whereas the addition of glycerol hampered hair follicle targeting and promoted passive diffusion. Propylene glycol was found to promote both pathways. In fact, the study proved that formulating nanocrystals to improve the bioefficacy of poorly soluble API upon dermal application is highly effective. However, this is only true, if the correct excipient is selected for the formulation of the vehicle. The study also showed that excipients can be used to allow for a targeted dermal drug delivery, which enables to control if API should be delivered via passive diffusion and/or as drug reservoir by depositing API in the hair follicles.",

Here we combine marker-independent long-term 3D live imaging and single-cell transcriptomics to capture a dynamic lineage progression and transcriptome changes in the entire epithelium of the mouse hair follicle as it develops. We found that the precursors of different epithelial lineages were aligned in a 2D concentric manner in the basal layer of the hair placode.

Prospective bulge stem cells were derived from the peripheral ring of the placode basal layer, but not from suprabasal cells (as was previously suggested3).

In addition, alopecia is associated with a decrease in the micro-vascularization of the hair follicles. In this study, the role of glypicans (GPCs) was analyzed in the regulation of the angiogenesis of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC). The analysis of glypican gene expression showed that GPC1 is the major glypican expressed by human keratinocytes of outer root sheath (KORS), human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HHFDPC) and HDMEC. KORS were demonstrated to secrete VEGF and HGF. The HDMEC pseudotube formation was induced by KORS conditioned media (KORSCM). It was totally abrogated after GPC1 siRNA transfection of HDMEC. Moreover, when cleaved by phospholipase C (PLC), GPC1 promotes the proliferation of HDMEC. Finally, GPC1 was shown to interact directly with VEGFR2 or c-Met to regulate angiogenesis induced by the activation of these receptors. Altogether, these results showed that GPC1 is a key regulator of microvascular endothelial cell angiogenesis induced by VEGF and HGF secreted by KORS.

Hair loss is one of the most common chronic diseases, with a detrimental effect on a patient ' s psychosocial life. Hair loss results from damage to the hair follicle (HF) and/or hair regeneration cycle. Various damaging factors, such as hereditary, inflammation, and aging, impair hair regeneration by inhibiting the activation of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and dermal papilla cells (DPCs). Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) regulates the inflammatory response and the activity of various types of stem cells, and has recently been reported to have a protective effect on hair loss. Given that stem cell activity is the driving force for hair regeneration, we hypothesized that FPR2 influences hair regeneration by mediating HFSC activity. To prove this hypothesis, we investigated the role of FPR2 in hair regeneration using Fpr2 knockout (KO) mice. Fpr2 KO mice were found to have excessive hair loss and abnormal HF structures and skin layer construction compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The levels of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and beta-catenin, which promote HF regeneration, were significantly decreased, and the expression of bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) 2/4, an inhibitor of the anagen phase, was significantly increased in Fpr2 KO mice compared to WT mice.

However, the research on the development of cashmere goat secondary hair follicles is still relatively scarce. In this study, small RNA libraries and mRNA libraries of 45 days, 55 days, 65 days, and 75 days of fetal skin of cashmere goats were constructed, and the constructed libraries were sequenced using Illumina Hiseq4000, and the expression profiles of miRNA and mRNA in cashmere goat fetal skin were obtained. The differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs in six control groups were identified and the qRT-PCR experiment shows that the sequencing results are accurate. Sixty-six miRNAs related to secondary hair follicle development were screened, and used TargetScan and miRanda to predict 33 highly expressed miRNA target genes. At the same time, 664 mRNAs related to the development of secondary hair follicles were screened, and GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis were performed. It was found that some miRNA target genes were consistent with the screening results of mRNAs related to secondary hair follicle development and were enriched in Notch signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway. Therefore, miR-145-5p-DLL4, miR-27b-3p-DLL4, miR-30e-5p-DLL4, miR-193b-3p-TGF-beta1, miR-181b-5p-NOTCH2, and miR-103-3p-NOTCH2 regulatory network related to the development of secondary hair follicles were constructed and the results of dual-luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that there is a targeted relationship between chi-miR-30e-5p and DLL4, which will provide a basis for molecular mechanism of miRNA-mRNA in the development of the hair follicles in cashmere goats.",

Alopecia areata (AA) is a type of immune-mediated alopecia. Recent studies have suggested microRNAs ' (miRNAs) implication in several cellular processes, including epidermal and hair follicle biology. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can modify gene expression levels, which may induce an autoimmune response. This case-control study included 480 participants (240 for each case/control group). MicroRNA-34a gene (MIR-34A) rs2666433A/G variant was genotyped using real-time allelic discrimination polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Additionally, circulatory miR-34a levels were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). On comparing between alopecia and non-alopecia cohorts, a higher frequency of A variant was noted among patients when compared to controls-A allele: 28 versus 18% (p < 0. 001) ; A/A genotype: 9 versus 2% ; A/G genotype: 39 versus 32% (p < 0. 001). A/A and A/G carriers were more likely to develop alopecia under heterozygote comparison (OR = 1. 83, 95% CI = 1. 14-2. 93), homozygote comparison (OR = 4. 19, 95% CI = 1. 33-13. 1), dominant (OR = 2. 0, 95% CI = 1. 27-3. 15), recessive (OR = 3. 36, 95% CI = 1. 08-10. 48), over-dominant (OR = 1. 65, 95% CI = 1. 04-32. 63), and log additive (OR = 1. 91, 95% CI = 1. 3-2. 82) models. Serum miR-34a expression levels were upregulated in alopecia patients with a median and quartile fold change of 27. 3 (1. 42-2430). Significantly higher levels were more pronounced in A/A genotype patients (p < 0. 01). Patients carrying the heterozygote genotype (rs2666433 * A/G) were two times more likely to develop more severe disease grades. Stratified analysis by sex revealed the same results. A high expression level was associated with concomitant autoimmune comorbidities (p = 0. 001), in particular SLE (p = 0. 007) and vitiligo (p = 0. 049). In conclusion, the MIR34A rs2666433 (A/G) variant is associated with AA risk and severity in the studied population. Furthermore, high miR-34a circulatory levels could play a role in disease pathogenesis.",

Wnt signaling plays a pivotal role in regulating activation, proliferation, stem cell renewal and differentiation of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Secreted frizzled related protein-1 (Sfrp1), a Wnt antagonist is up regulated in the HFSCs ; however, its role in the HFSCs regulation is still obscure. Here, we show that Sfrp1 loss showed a depletion of HFSCs, enhanced HFSC proliferation and faster hair follicle cycle at PD21 to PD28, HFSC markers such as Lgr5 and Axin2 were decreased in both the Sfrp1 +/-and Sfrp1-/-HFSCs. In addition, the second hair follicle cycle was also faster as compared to WT. Importantly, Sfrp1-/-showed a restoration of HFSC by 2 nd telogen (PD49), while Sfrp1 +/-did not show restoration with still having a decreased HFSC. Infact, restoration of HFSCs was due to a pronounced down-regulation of beta-CATENIN activity mediated through a cross-talk of BMP-AKT-GSK3beta signalling in Sfrp1-/-as compared to Sfrp1 +/-, where down regulation was less pronounced. In cultured keratinocytes, Sfrp1 loss resulted in enhanced proliferation and clonogenicity, which were reversed by treating with either BMPR1A or GSK3beta inhibitor thereby confirming BMP-AKT-GSK3beta signaling involved in beta-CATENIN regulation in both the Sfrp1 +/-and Sfrp1-/-mice. Our study reveals a novel function of Sfrp1 by unravelling an in vivo molecular mechanism that regulate the HFSCs pool mediated through a hitherto unknown cross-talk of BMP-AKT-GSK3beta signalling that maintain stem cell pool balance, which in turn maintain skin tissue homeostasis.",

    "text": "A probabilistic Boolean model on hair follicle cell fate regulation by TGF-beta. Hair follicles (HFs) are mini skin organs that undergo cyclic growth. Various signals regulate HF cell fate decisions jointly. Recent experimental results suggest that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) exhibits a dual role in HF cell fate regulation that can be either anti-or pro-apoptosis. To understand the underlying mechanisms of HF cell fate control, we develop a novel probabilistic Boolean network (pBN) model on the HF epithelial cell gene regulation dynamics. First, the model is derived from literature, then refined using single-cell RNA sequencing data. Using the model, we both explore the mechanisms underlying HF cell fate decisions and make predictions that could potentially guide future experiments: 1) we propose that a threshold-like switch in the TGF-beta strength may necessitate the dual roles of TGF-beta in either activating apoptosis or cell proliferation, in cooperation with Bmp and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and at different stages of a follicle growth cycle ; 2) our model shows concordance with the high-activator-low-inhibitor theory of anagen initiation ; 3) we predict that TNF may be more effective in catagen initiation than TGF-beta, and they may cooperate in a two-step fashion ; 4) finally, predictions of gene knockout and overexpression reveal the roles in HF cell fate regulations of each gene. Attractor and motif analysis from the associated Boolean networks reveal the relations between the topological structure of the gene regulation network and the cell fate regulation mechanism. A discrete spatial model equipped with the pBN illustrates how TGF-beta and TNF cooperate in initiating and driving the apoptosis wave during catagen.",

    "text": "Effects of NCSTN Mutation on Hair Follicle Components in Mice. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)/acne inversa is an intractable skin disease that is characterized by destructive lesions-primarily on the flexural areas. Although its etiology is unknown, genetics is considered to be a factor of its pathology-mutations in gamma-secretase genes have been identified in certain familial HS patients, and follicular occlusion is widely accepted as the primary cause of HS. But, no relationship between these mutations and the components of hair follicles has been reported. Thus, we examined changes in these components in mice with a mutation in NCSTN (a gamma-secretase gene). METHODS: We generated C57BL/6 mice with an NCSTN mutation and examined their expression of hair cortex cytokeratin and trichohyalin by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, in addition to nicastrin, the product of NCSTN, and NICD compared with wild-type mice. The structure of hair follicles was analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: In mice with an NCSTN mutation, HS-like skin lesions appeared after age 6 months, the pathological manifestations of which were consistent with the features of human HS. The structure of hair follicles was abnormal in mice with an NCSTN mutation versus wild-type mice, and hair cortex cytokeratin, trichohyalin, nicastrin, and NICD were downregulated in these mice. CONCLUSIONS: This NCSTN mutant mouse model could be an improved model to study early lesion development aspects of human HS pathogenesis and could perhaps be a better alternative for evaluating early-acting and preventive therapeutics for HS experimentally before clinical trials in HS patients. NCSTN mutations disrupt the development of hair follicles, leading to abnormal hair follicle structures, perhaps resulting in the onset of HS.",

BACKGROUND: Stem cell-based therapy has received considerable attention as a potential candidate in the treatment of ischemic stroke ; however, employing an appropriate type of stem cells and an effective delivery route are still challenging. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of safe, noninvasive, and brain-targeted intranasal administration of hair follicle-derived stem cells (HFSCs) in a rat model of ischemic stroke. METHODS: Stem cells were obtained from the adult rat hair follicles. In experiment 1, stroke was induced by 30 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and stem cells were intranasally transplanted immediately after ischemia. In experiment 2, stroke was induced by 120 min MCAO and stem cells were administered 24 h after cerebral ischemia. In all experimental groups, neurological performance, short-term spatial working memory and infarct volume were assessed. Moreover, relative expression of major trophic factors in the striatum and cortex was evaluated by the quantitative PCR technique. The end point of experiment 1 was day 3 and the end point of experiment 2 was day 15. RESULTS: In both experiments, intranasal administration of HFSCs improved functional performance and decreased infarct volume compared to the MCAO rats. Furthermore, NeuN and VEGF expression were higher in the transplanted group and stem cell therapy partially prevented BDNF and neurotrophin-3 over-expression induced by cerebral ischemia.

The balance between activators and inhibitors may determine the time required for telogen hair follicles to reenter anagen. We previously reported that Wnt10b (wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site family member 10b) could promote the growth of hair follicles in vitro. To unveil the roles of Wnt10b in hair follicle regeneration, we established an in vivo mouse model using intradermal injection. On the basis of this model, we found that Wnt10b could induce the biological switch of hair follicles from telogen to anagen when overexpressed in the skin. The induced hair follicles expressed structure markers and could cycle normally into catagen. Conversely, anagen onset was abrogated by the knockdown of Wnt10b with small interfering RNA (siRNA). The Wnt10b aberrant expression data suggest that it is one of the activators of hair follicle regeneration. The beta-catenin protein is translocated to the nucleus in Wnt10b-induced hair follicles. The biological effects of Wnt10b were abrogated when beta-catenin expression was downregulated with siRNA. These data revealed that Wnt10b might induce hair follicle regeneration in vivo via the enhanced activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. To our knowledge, our data provide previously unreported insights into the regulation of hair follicle cycling and provide potential therapeutic targets for hair follicle-related diseases.",

We have previously demonstrated that the neural stem-cell marker nestin is expressed in hair follicle stem cells. Nestin-expressing cells were initially identified in the hair follicle bulge area (BA) using a transgenic mouse model in which the nestin promoter drives the green fluorescent protein (ND-GFP). The hair-follicle ND-GFP-expressing cells are keratin 15-negative and CD34-positive and could differentiate to neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells and melanocytes in vitro. Subsequently, we showed that the nestin-expressing stem cells could affect nerve and spinal cord regeneration after injection in mouse models. In the present study, we separated the mouse vibrissa hair follicle into three parts (upper, middle and lower). Each part of the follicle was cultured separately in DMEM-F12 containing B-27 and 1% methylcellulose supplemented with basic FGF. After 2 mo, the nestin-expressing cells from each of the separated parts of the hair follicle proliferated and formed spheres. Upon transfer of the spheres to RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, the nestin-expressing cells in the spheres differentiated to neurons, as well as glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells and melanocytes. The differentiated cells were produced by spheres which formed from nestin-expressing cells from all segments of the hair follicle. However, the differentiation potential is greatest in the upper part of the follicle. This result is consistent with trafficking of nestin-expressing cells throughout the hair follicle from the bulge area to the dermal papilla that we previously observed. The nestin-expressing cells from the upper part of the follicle produced spheres in very large amounts, which in turn differentiated to neurons and other cell types. The results of the present study demonstrate that multipotent, nestin-expressing stem cells are present throughout the hair follicle and that the upper part of the follicle can produce the stem cells in large amounts that could be used for nerve and spinal cord repair.",

Embryonic hair follicle induction and formation are regulated by mesenchymal-epithelial interactions between specialized dermal cells and epidermal stem cells that switch to a hair fate. Similarly, during postnatal hair growth, communication between mesenchymal dermal papilla cells and surrounding epithelial matrix cells coordinates hair shaft production. Adult hair follicle regeneration in the hair cycle again is thought to be controlled by activating signals originating from the mesenchymal compartment and acting on hair follicle stem cells. Although many signaling pathways are implicated in hair follicle formation and growth, the precise nature, timing, and intersection of these inductive and regulatory signals remains elusive.

How cell fate decisions of stem and progenitor cells are regulated by their microenvironment or niche is a central question in stem cell and regenerative biology. Although functional analysis of hair follicle epithelial stem cells by gene targeting is well established, the molecular and genetic characterization of the dermal counterpart during embryonic morphogenesis has been lacking because of the absence of cell type-specific drivers. Here, we report that T-box transcription factor Tbx18 specifically marks dermal papilla (DP) precursor cells during embryonic hair follicle morphogenesis. With Tbx18 (LacZ), Tbx18 (H2BGFP), and Tbx18 (Cre) knock-in mouse models, we demonstrate LacZ and H2BGFP (nuclear green fluorescent protein) expression and Cre activity in dermal condensates of nascent first-wave hair follicles at E14. 5. As Tbx18 expression becomes more widespread throughout the dermis at later developmental stages, we use tamoxifen-inducible Cre-expressing mice, Tbx18 (MerCreMer), to exclusively target DP precursor cells and their progeny. Finally, we ablate Tbx18 in full knockout mice, but find no perturbations in hair follicle formation, suggesting that Tbx18 is dispensable for normal DP function. In summary, our study establishes Tbx18 as a genetic driver to target for the first time embryonic DP precursors for labeling, isolation, and gene ablation that will greatly enhance investigations into their molecular functions during hair follicle morphogenesis.",

In the bulge region of the hair follicle, a densely and concentrically packed cell mass is encircled by the arrector pili muscle (APM), which offers a specilized microenvironment (niche) for housing heterogeneous adult stem cells. However, the detailed histological architecture and the cellular composition of the bulge region warrants intensive study and may have implications for the regulation of hair follicle growth regulation. This study was designed to define the gene-expression profiles of putative stem cells and lineage-specific precursors in the mid-portions of plucked hair follicles prepared according to the presence of detectable autofluorescence. The structure was also characterized by using a consecutive sectioning technique. The bulge region of the hair follicle with autofluorescence was precisely excised by employing a micro-dissection procedure. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to identify the gene expression profiles specific for epithelial, melanocyte and stromal stem cells in the bulge region of the hair follicle visualized by autofluorescence. The morphology and its age-dependent changes of bulge region of the hair follicles with autofluorescence segment were also examined in 9 scalp skin specimens collected from patients aged 30 weeks to 75 years, by serial sectioning and immuno-staining. Gene expression profile analysis revealed that there were cells with mRNA transcripts of Dct (Hi) Tyrase (Lo)-Tyrp1 (Lo) MC1R (Lo) MITF (Lo)/K15 (Hi)/NPNT (Hi) in the bulge region of the hair follicle with autofluorescence segments, which differed from the patterns in hair bulbs. Small cell-protrusions that sprouted from the outer root sheath (ORS) were clearly observed at the APM inserting level in serial sections of hair follicles by immunohistological staining, which were characteristically replete with K15 +/K19 + expressing cells. Likewise, the muscle bundles of APM positive for smooth muscle actin intimately encircled these cell-protrusions, and the occurrence frequency of the cell-protrusions was increased in fetal scalp skin compared with adult scalp skin. This study provided the evidence that the cell-protrusions occurring at the ORS relative to the APM insertion are more likely to be characteristic of the visible niches that are filled with abundant stem cells. The occurrence frequency of these cell-protrusions was significantly increased in fetal scalp skin samples (128%) as compared with the scalp skins of younger (49. 4%) and older (25. 4%) adults (P < 0. 01), but difference in the frequency between the two adult groups were not significant. These results indicated that these cell-protrusions function as a niche house for the myriad stem cells and/or precursors to meet the needs of the development of hair follicles in an embryo. The micro-dissection used in this study was simple and reliable in excising the bulge region of the hair follicle with autofluorescence segments dependent on their autofluorescence is of value for the study of stem cell culture.",

The hair follicle stem cells phenotype from rat whisker hair follicles was checked by using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Cytokeratins 7, 8, 15 and 18 were used as markers. Urothelial cell conditioned medium increased the expression of urothelial markers (cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 8, cytokeratin 18), whereas it decreased a hair follicle stem cells marker (cytokeratin 15) after 2 weeks of culture. This process depended on the time of cultivation. This medium was able to sustain the epithelial phenotype of the culture. Other media including a co-culture system failed to induce similar changes. Smooth muscle conditioned medium resulted in a loss of cells in culture.

Human hair disorders comprise a number of different types of alopecia, atrichia, hypotrichosis, distinct hair shaft disorders as well as hirsutism and hypertrichosis. Their causes vary from genodermatoses (e. g. hypotrichoses) via immunological disorders (e. g. alopecia areata, autoimmune cicatrical alopecias) to hormone-dependent abnormalities (e. g. androgenetic alopecia). A large number of spontaneous mouse mutants and genetically engineered mice develop abnormalities in hair follicle morphogenesis, cycling, and/or hair shaft formation, whose analysis has proven invaluable to define the molecular regulation of hair growth, ranging from hair follicle development, and cycling to hair shaft formation and stem cell biology. Also, the accumulating reports on hair phenotypes of mouse strains provide important pointers to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying human hair growth disorders. Since numerous new mouse mutants with a hair phenotype have been reported since the publication of our earlier review on this matter a decade ago, we present here an updated, tabulated mini-review. The updated annotated tables list a wide selection of mouse mutants with hair growth abnormalities, classified into four categories: Mutations that affect hair follicle (1) morphogenesis, (2) cycling, (3) structure, and (4) mutations that induce extrafollicular events (for example immune system defects) resulting in secondary hair growth abnormalities. This synthesis is intended to provide a useful source of reference when studying the molecular controls of hair follicle growth and differentiation, and whenever the hair phenotypes of a newly generated mouse mutant need to be compared with existing ones.",

A3-positive cells began to be seen in the hair germ and peg in fetuses and neonates ; the positive cells were epithelial cells above basal cells. Furthermore, A3-positive cells were seen in the outer root sheath adjacent to the bulge in mature hair follicles. Double immunofluorescence revealed that these A3-positive epithelial cells reacted to E-cadherin (for all epithelial elements) but not to CK15 (for basal cells/epithelial stem cells) or to nestin (for stem cells), indicating that A3-positive epithelial cells are suprabasal cells in the developing epidermic hair follicle. Additionally, spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells surrounding the hair peg and mature hair follicle reacted to A3 ; in double immunofluorescence, the A3-positive cells were located outside collagen type IV-positive glassy membrane, and reacted to vimentin (for mesenchmal cells), Thy-1 (for immature mesenchymal cells), CD34 (for stem cells) and nestin, but not to alpha-smooth muscle actin (for myofibroblasts) ; the positive cells were regarded as immature mesenchymal cells with stem cell nature in the connective tissue sheath of developing hair follicles. A3-positive epithelial and mesenchymal cells did not show proliferating activity. Collectively, it is considered that A3-positive cells seen in developing rat hair follicles may be quiescent post-progenitor cells with the potential to differentiate into either highly-differentiated epithelial or mesenchymal cells.

BACKGROUND: Although cutaneous stem cells have been implicated in skin tumourigenesis in humans, no studies have been conducted to elucidate the presence and the possible role of stem cells in hair follicle tumours in the dog. HYPOTHESIS: Stem cell markers are expressed in canine epidermal and follicular tumours and can be used to better understand the biology and origin of these tumours. ANIMALS AND METHODS: In the present study, normal skin sections and 44 follicular tumours were retrospectively investigated for the immunohistochemical expression of keratin 15 (K15) and nestin. In addition, 30 squamous cell carcinomas were evaluated for K15 expression. RESULTS: In normal skin, K15 and nestin were expressed in the outer root sheath cells of the isthmic portion of the hair follicle (bulge region), and K15 expression was also scattered in the basal cell layer of the epidermis. Infundibular keratinizing acanthomas, pilomatricomas and squamous cell carcinomas were mostly negative for K15, trichoblastomas were moderately to strongly positive, tricholemmomas were either negative or strongly positive, and trichoepitheliomas had heterogeneous staining. Nestin expression was generally faint in all follicular tumours. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Our results show that K15 can be a reliable marker for investigating the role of stem cells in hair follicle tumours of the dog, while nestin was judged to be a nonoptimal marker. Furthermore, our study suggests that hair follicle stem cells are present in the bulge region of hair follicles and could possibly play a role in tumourigenesis of canine tumours originating from this portion of the follicle, namely trichoblastomas, tricholemmomas and trichoepitheliomas. The loss of K15 expression in squamous cell carcinomas compared with normal skin suggests that this event could be important in the malignant transformation.",

The mammalian hair follicle unit consists of a central follicle and a series of associated structures: sebaceous glands, arrector pili muscles, Merkel cells, and sensory nerve endings. The architecture of this multicellular structure is highly polarized with respect to the body axes. Previous work has implicated Frizzled6 (Fz6)-mediated planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in the initial specification of hair follicle orientation. Here we investigate the origin of polarity information among structures within the hair follicle unit. Merkel cell clusters appear to have direct access to Fz6-based polarity information, and they lose polarity in the absence of Fz6. By contrast, the other follicle-associated structures likely derive some or all of their polarity cues from hair follicles, and as a result, their orientations closely match that of their associated follicle. These experiments reveal the interplay between global and local sources of polarity information for coordinating the spatial arrangement of diverse multicellular structures.

Hair follicle morphogenesis and regeneration depend on intensive but well-orchestrated interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal components. Accordingly, the enhancement of this crosstalk represents a promising approach to achieve successful bioengineering of human hair follicles. The present article summarizes the techniques, both currently available and potentially feasible, to promote epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (EMIs) necessary for human hair follicle regeneration. The strategies include the preparation of epithelial components with high receptivity to trichogenic dermal signals and/or mesenchymal cell populations with potent hair inductive capacity. In this regard, bulge epithelial stem cells, keratinocytes predisposed to hair follicle fate or keratinocyte precursor cells with plasticity may provide favorable epithelial cell populations. Dermal papilla cells sustaining intrinsic hair inductive capacity, putative dermal papilla precursor cells in the dermal sheath/neonatal dermis or trichogenic dermal cells derived from undifferentiated stem/progenitor cells are promising candidates as hair inductive dermal cells. The most established protocol for in vivo hair follicle reconstitution is co-grafting of epithelial and mesenchymal components into immunodeficient mice. In theory, combination of individually optimized cellular components of respective lineages should elicit most intensive EMIs to form hair follicles. Still, EMIs can be further ameliorated by the modulation of non-cell autonomous conditions, including cell compartmentalization to replicate the positional relationship in vivo and humanization of host environment by preparing human stromal bed. These approaches may not always synergistically intensify EMIs, however, step-by-step investigation probing optimal combinations should maximally enhance EMIs to achieve successful human hair follicle bioengineering.",

We sought to determine whether there is a perivascular niche for hair follicle stem cells.

By birth, a vascular annulus stereotypically surrounded the keratin 15 negative (K15-) stem cells in the upper bulge and remained associated with the K15-upper bulge throughout the hair cycle. The angiogenic factor Egfl6 was expressed by the K15-bulge and was localized adjacent to the vascular annulus, which comprised post-capillary venules. Although denervation altered the phenotype of upper bulge stem cells, the vascular annulus persisted in surgically denervated mouse skin. The importance of the perivascular niche was further suggested by the fact that vascular annuli formed around the upper bulge of de novo-reconstituted hair follicles before their innervation.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Alopecia areata (AA) is a non-scarring inflammatory hair loss disease. We investigated the early pathological changes of AA to identify possible factors participating in its pathogenesis. METHODS: Clinical, laboratory and pathological features of 87 AA patients were investigated. RESULTS: Anti-nuclear antibody was found in 11 of 85 patients tested (13%), with a higher percentage in women (21%) than men (5%) (P = 0. 026). In early AA lesions, inflammatory infiltration in the upper dermis and epithelial cell damage of the hair follicle infundibulum, just above the sebaceous gland, was observed. Liquefaction and disarrangement of peripheral infundibular epithelial cells coexisted with T-lymphocytic invasion and regression of the lower follicle. The latter findings positively correlated with the presence of eosinophils and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration in the upper dermis. Eosinophilic infiltration was found in 35 patients (40%) and was positively correlated to elevated serum IgE levels (r = 0. 21, P = 0. 044), a more severe perivascular lymphocytic inflammation in the upper dermis (r = 0. 24, P = 0. 026), as well as a prominent swarm of bees-like peri-follicular infiltration (r = 0. 41, P < 0. 001). Mast cells were abundant in the upper dermis, especially around blood vessels, and positively correlated with eosinophil presence (r = 0. 30, P = 0. 027). CONCLUSION: Damage to the hair follicle infundibulum in the upper dermis might be an important component of early changes in AA lesions, possibly caused by lymphocyte cell infiltration in the same area. AA may involve damage of the upper hair follicle as well as the bulb, possibly involving hypersensitivity and autoimmunity.",

OBJECTIVE: To explore the functions of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the restoration of hair follicles with a mixture of human dermal papilla cells and human hair follicle outer root sheath cells in vitro in nude mice. METHODS: Human hair follicle outer root sheath cells (hfORS) and human hair dermal papilla cells (hDP) were cultured in vitro and mixed in a fixed ratio (hfORS: hDP = 5: 1). Flow cytometry was used to detect the content of CD200 (+) cells in human hair follicle outer root sheath cells. And 8 nude mice were divided randomly into 2 groups according to a random number table and back wounds produced. Group A was transplanted with cell mixture plus 20 microg/L CTGF. Group B was transplanted with cell mixture alone. After 8 weeks of transplantation, the development of hair follicle formation was observed histologically. PCR was used to detect the expression of human specific DNA and mice DNA in transplants. RESULTS: The portion of CD200 (+) cells in cultured hfORS was 19. 65%. At 8 weeks after implantation, hair follicle formation could be observed in Group A (268 +-96) more than Group B (62 +-20). The difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). And PCR showed that there was human composition in transplant. CONCLUSION: CTGF can induce the formation of hair follicle by promoting the interference between hDP and hfORS.",

Broad dermal Wnt signaling is required for patterned induction of hair follicle placodes and subsequent Wnt signaling in placode stem cells is essential for induction of dermal condensates, cell clusters of precursors for the hair follicle dermal papilla (DP). Progression of hair follicle formation then requires coordinated signal exchange between dermal condensates and placode stem cells. However, it remains unknown whether continued Wnt signaling in DP precursor cells plays a role in this process, largely due to the long-standing inability to specifically target dermal condensates for gene ablation. Here we use the Tbx18 (Cre) knockin mouse line to ablate the Wnt-responsive transcription factor beta-catenin specifically in these cells at E14. 5 during the first wave of guard hair follicle formation. In the absence of beta-catenin, canonical Wnt signaling is effectively abolished in these cells. Sox2 (+) dermal condensates initiate normally ; however by E16. 5 guard hair follicle numbers are strongly reduced and by E18. 5 most whiskers and guard hair follicles are absent, suggesting that active Wnt signaling in dermal condensates is important for hair follicle formation to proceed after induction. To explore the molecular mechanisms by which Wnt signaling in dermal condensates regulates hair follicle formation, we analyze genome-wide the gene expression changes in embryonic beta-catenin null DP precursor cells. We find altered expression of several signaling pathway genes, including Fgfs and Activin, both previously implicated in hair follicle formation. In summary, these data reveal a functional role of Wnt signaling in DP precursors for embryonic hair follicle formation and identify Fgf and Activin signaling as potential effectors of Wnt signaling-regulated events.",

Subsequently, several studies using cultured cells have enabled identification of hair growth modulators with similar properties to the currently available drugs, which may also provide clinical benefit. In situations where the current therapeutics do not work, follicular unit transplantation is an alternative surgical option. More recently, the concept of follicular cell implantation, or hair follicle neogenesis, has been attempted, exploiting the inherent properties of cultured hair follicle cells to induce de novo hair growth in balding scalp.

Hair follicles are appendages of the mammalian skin that have the ability to periodically and stereotypically regenerate in order to continuously produce new hair over our lifetime. The ability of the hair follicle to regenerate is due to the presence of stem cells that along with other cell populations and non-cellular components, including molecular signals and extracellular material, make up a niche microenvironment. Mounting evidence suggests that the niche is critical for regulating stem cell behavior and thus the process of regeneration. Here, we review the literature concerning past and current studies that have utilized mouse genetic models, combined with other approaches to dissect the molecular and cellular composition of the hair follicle niche.

EPs can revert to SCs upon injury, but whether this dedifferentiation occurs in normal HF homeostasis (hair cycle) and the mechanisms regulating both differentiation and dedifferentiation are unclear. Here, we use lineage tracing, gain of function, transcriptional profiling, and functional assays to examine the role of observed endogenous Runx1 level changes in the hair cycle. We find that forced Runx1 expression induces hair degeneration (catagen) and simultaneously promotes changes in the quiescent bulge SC transcriptome toward a cell state resembling the EP HG fate. This cell-state transition is functionally reversible. We propose that SC differentiation and dedifferentiation are likely to occur during normal HF degeneration and niche restructuring in response to changes in endogenous Runx1 levels associated with SC location with respect to the niche.",

Here, we unfold genome-wide transcriptional and chromatin landscapes of beta-catenin-TCF3/4-TLE circuitry, and genetically dissect their biological roles within the native HFSC niche. We show that during HFSC quiescence, TCF3, TCF4 and TLE (Groucho) bind coordinately and transcriptionally repress Wnt target genes. We also show that beta-catenin is dispensable for HFSC viability, and if TCF3/4 levels are sufficiently reduced, it is dispensable for proliferation. However, beta-catenin is essential to activate genes that launch hair follicle fate and suppress sebocyte fate determination. TCF3/4 deficiency mimics Wnt-beta-catenin-dependent activation of these hair follicle fate targets ; TCF3 overexpression parallels their TLE4-dependent suppression. Our studies unveil TCF3/4-TLE histone deacetylases as a repressive rheostat, whose action can be relieved by Wnt-beta-catenin signalling. When TCF3/4 and TLE levels are high, HFSCs can maintain stemness, but remain quiescent. When these levels drop or when Wnt-beta-catenin levels rise, this balance is shifted and hair regeneration initiates.",

OBJECTIVE: To assess the normal value of the hair follicle counts in a 4-mm punch biopsy on the vertex scalp area from the Thai population. To compare the hair follicle count in the present study with those in previous described reports. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Twenty autopsy patients of clinically normal scalp were obtained for study from the Department of Forensic Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed on each patient on the vertex area of the scalp and, subsequently, horizontally bisected at the level of 1 mm below the skin surface and studied by hematoxylin-eosin staining. The total number of hair follicles, the phase of each hair follicle in a normal hair cycle, the number of terminal hairs, intermediate hairs, vellus hairs, and hair follicular unit were also included in this study and compared to those in previously described reports. RESULTS: Of our 20 studied cases, the mean numbers of total hair follicle counts, terminal, intermediate, and vellus hair follicles were 28. 3 +/-9. 2, 16. 5 +/-8. 4, 5. 0 +/-4. 6, and 6. 9 +/-7. 0 respectively.

BACKGROUND: Autologous non-cultured outer root sheath hair follicle cell suspension (NCORSHFS) is a recently described novel cellular graft technique for the treatment of stable vitiligo. There is lack of data about various factors determining the repigmentation rate in vitiligo patients undergoing this novel surgical therapy. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics and treatment variables determining therapeutic outcome in patients of stable vitiligo undergoing NCORSHFS. METHODS: Non-cultured outer root sheath hair follicle cell suspension was prepared from anagen hairs extracted from the occipital area. The number of melanocytes and hair follicle stem cells (HFSC) in the suspension was quantified by staining with anti-HMB45 and anti-CD200 antibody, respectively. In all patients, a 2 mm punch skin biopsy was taken from one of the vitiligo patch to be treated prior to surgery for assessment of histomorphological features. Post surgery patients were followed up at regular intervals for 24 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty patients (21 females, 9 males) with a clinical diagnosis of stable vitiligo, with a total of 60 target lesions were included in this study. The mean age of the study population was 21. 10 +-5. 64 years. The number of melanocytes (P = 0. 04) and HFSC (P = 0. 01) transplanted were significantly higher among patients achieving optimum repigmentation (> 75% repigmentation). There was a strong correlation between repigmentation at 24 week and number of melanocytes and HFSC transplanted. Number of HFSC transplanted and absence of dermal inflammation were significant predictors of achieving optimum repigmentation. CONCLUSION: The number of melanocytes and HFSC transplanted and absence of dermal inflammation were important determents of optimal repigmentation in patients undergoing NCORSHFS for treatment of stable vitiligo. Hence, refining the technique of NCORSHFS on the basis of these factors would help in achieving better surgical outcomes.",

The skin permeations of ionized LC, FL, and FD-4 were decreased by hair follicle-plugging.

Instead, these TG mice displayed impaired hair follicle transition from telogen to anagen, most likely due to impaired canonical Wnt signalling.

No adverse consequences of the PSHG application were observed. Naturally occurring propagating regenerative hair waves peculiar to mice were preserved. In older mice (more than 2 years) with signs of alopecia, application of PSHG caused an overgrowing of bald patches within two months. Transcriptome analysis of the PSHG effect performed in fibroblast cell culture showed that PSHG stimulates processes of tissue development and remodeling. These observations together with previous findings showing that PSHG stimulates autophagy and induces death of cells subjected to oxidative stress may suggest that the mechanism of the PSHG effect involves stimulation of regeneration of skin and its derivatives owing to more efficient elimination of senescent and damaged follicle cells.",

    "text": "Hair follicle melanocyte precursors are awoken by ultraviolet radiation via a cell extrinsic mechanism. Melanocyte stem cells (MCSCs) in the upper portion of the hair follicle periodically supply melanocytes (MCs) that migrate downward into the hair bulb during anagen, the growth phase of the hair cycle. However MCs can also migrate upwards. We previously observed an increase in epidermal MC density in the mouse epidermis after a single ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure in neonatal, but not adult mice. To better understand MCSC activation by UVR we methodically studied the response of MCs to narrow band UVB (since UVA does not invoke this response) exposure in neonatal mice, and in adults at different stages of the hair cycle. We found that a single exposure of adult mice did not induce activation of MCSCs, in any stage of the hair cycle. When adult mice MCSCs were isolated in telogen, multiple UVB exposures resulted in their activation and production of daughter cells, which migrated upwards to the epidermis. Importantly, the MCSCs produced new progeny without themselves having incurred DNA damage after UVB exposure. This, together with examination of MC localisation in the skin of mice overexpressing stem cell factor in their keratinocytes, leads us to conclude that MCSC activation by UVB is driven via paracrine production of either SCF and/or other keratinocyte cytokines. We re-examined the increase in epidermal MC density in neonatal mouse skin. This effect was much more profound after only a single exposure than that of even multiple exposures to adult skin, and we show that in this setting also, the epidermal MCs mostly derive from activation of MC precursors in the upper hair follicle, and most likely via a cell extrinsic mechanism. Hence, although adaptive changes in the skin induced by repetitive UVB exposures are necessary in adult mice, in both the adult and neonatal context the division and migration upwards of follicular MCSCs is the major mode by which epidermal MC numbers increase after UVR exposure.",

Thus, it is possible to capture behaviors including apoptosis, proliferation and migration, and to revisit the same cells for in vivo lineage tracing. In addition, a wide range of fluorescent reporter mouse lines facilitates TPLSM in the skin. This protocol also describes TPLSM laser ablation, which can spatiotemporally manipulate specific cellular populations of the hair follicle or microenvironment to test their regenerative contributions. The preparation time is variable depending on the goals of the experiment, but it generally takes 30-60 min. Imaging time is dependent on the goals of the experiment.

Transcription factor CTIP2 (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor-interacting protein 2), also known as BCL11B, is expressed in hair follicles (HFs) of embryonic and adult skin. Ctip2-null mice exhibit reduced HF density during embryonic development. In contrast, conditional inactivation of Ctip2 in the epidermis (Ctip2 (ep-/-) mice) leads to a shorter telogen and a premature entry into anagen during the second phase of hair cycling without a detectable change in the number of HFs. Keratinocytes of the bulge stem cells (SCs) niche of Ctip2 (ep-/-) mice proliferate more and undergo reduced apoptosis compared with the corresponding cells of wild-type mice. However, premature activation of follicular SCs in mice lacking CTIP2 leads to the exhaustion of this SC compartment in comparison with Ctip2 (L2/L2) mice, which retained quiescent follicle SCs. CTIP2 modulates expression of genes encoding EGFR and NOTCH1 during formation of HFs and those encoding nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic calcineurin-dependent 1 and LIM homeobox 2 during normal hair cycling in adult skin. The expression of most of these genes is disrupted in mice lacking CTIP2, and these alterations may underlie the phenotype of Ctip2-null and Ctip2 (ep-/-) mice.

Among the unique features of humans, one of the most salient is the ability to effectively cool the body during extreme prolonged activity through the evapotranspiration of water on the skin ' s surface. The evolution of this novel physiological ability required a dramatic increase in the density and distribution of eccrine sweat glands relative to other mammals and a concomitant reduction of body hair cover. Elucidation of the genetic underpinnings for these adaptive changes is confounded by a lack of knowledge about how eccrine gland fate and density are specified during development. Moreover, although reciprocal changes in hair cover and eccrine gland density are required for efficient thermoregulation, it is unclear if these changes are linked by a common genetic regulation. To identify pathways controlling the relative patterning of eccrine glands and hair follicles, we exploited natural variation in the density of these organs between different strains of mice. Quantitative trait locus mapping identified a large region on mouse Chromosome 1 that controls both hair and eccrine gland densities. Differential and allelic expression analysis of the genes within this interval coupled with subsequent functional studies demonstrated that the level of En1 activity directs the relative numbers of eccrine glands and hair follicles. These findings implicate En1 as a newly identified and reciprocal determinant of hair follicle and eccrine gland density and identify a pathway that could have contributed to the evolution of the unique features of human skin.",

Four related cows showed hairless streaks on various parts of the body with no correlation to the pigmentation pattern. The stripes occurred in a consistent pattern resembling the lines of Blaschko. The non-syndromic hairlessness phenotype observed occurred across three generations of a single family and was compatible with an X-linked mode of inheritance. Linkage analysis and subsequent whole genome sequencing of one affected female identified two perfectly associated non-synonymous sequence variants in the critical interval on bovine chromosome X. Both variants occurred in complete linkage disequilibrium and were absent in more than 3900 controls. An ERCC6L missense mutation was predicted to cause an amino acid substitution of a non-conserved residue. Analysis in mice showed no specific Ercc6l expression pattern related to hair follicle development and therefore ERCC6L was not considered as causative gene. A point mutation at the 5 '-splice junction of exon 5 of the TSR2, 20S rRNA accumulation, homolog (S. cerevisiae), gene led to the production of two mutant transcripts, both of which contain a frameshift and generate a premature stop codon predicted to truncate approximately 25% of the protein. Interestingly, in addition to the presence of both physiological TSR2 transcripts, the two mutant transcripts were predominantly detected in the hairless skin of the affected cows. Immunohistochemistry, using an antibody against the N-terminal part of the bovine protein demonstrated the specific expression of the TSR2 protein in the skin and the hair of the affected and the control cows as well as in bovine fetal skin and hair. The RNA hybridization in situ showed that Tsr2 was expressed in pre-and post-natal phases of hair follicle development in mice.

Because of their crucial impact on our perception of beauty, eyelashes constitute a prime target for the cosmetic industry. However, when compared with other hair shafts and the mini-organs that produce them [eyelash hair follicles (ELHFs)], knowledge on the biology underlying growth and pigmentation of eyelashes is still rudimentary. This is due in part to the extremely restricted availability of human ELHFs for experimental study, underappreciation of their important sensory and protective functions and insufficient interest in understanding why they are distinct from scalp hair follicles (HFs) (e. g. ELHFs produce shorter hair shafts, do not possess an arrector pili muscle, have a shorter hair cycle and undergo greying significantly later than scalp HFs). Here we synthesize the limited current knowledge on the biology of ELHFs, in humans and other species, their role in health and disease, the known similarities with and differences from other HF populations, and their intrinsic interethnic variations. We define major open questions in the biology of these intriguing mini-organs and conclude by proposing future research directions.

The cutaneous healing response has evolved to occur rapidly, in order to minimize infection and to re-establish epithelial homeostasis. Rapid healing is achieved through complex coordination of multiple cell types, which importantly includes specific cell populations within the hair follicle (HF). Under physiological conditions, the epithelial compartments of HF and interfollicular epidermis remain discrete, with K15 (+ ve) bulge stem cells contributing progeny for HF reconstruction during the hair cycle and as a basis for hair shaft production during anagen. Only upon wounding do HF cells migrate from the follicle to contribute to the neo-epidermis. However, the identity of the first-responding cells, and in particular whether this process involves a direct contribution of K15 (+ ve) bulge cells to the early stage of epidermal wound repair remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that epidermal injury in murine skin does not induce bulge activation during early epidermal wound repair. Specifically, bulge cells of uninjured HFs neither proliferate nor appear to migrate out of the bulge niche upon epidermal wounding. In support of these observations, Diphtheria toxin-mediated partial ablation of K15 (+ ve) bulge cells fails to delay wound healing. Our data suggest that bulge cells only respond to epidermal wounding during later stages of repair.

Deleting Foxc1 in activated, but not quiescent, SCs causes failure of the cells to reestablish quiescence and allows premature activation. Deleting Foxc1 in the SC niche of gene-targeted mice leads to loss of the old hair without impairing quiescence. In self-renewing SCs, Foxc1 activates Nfatc1 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, two key mechanisms that govern quiescence.

In the epidermis of mice lacking transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity, primary hair follicle (HF) pre-placode formation is initiated without progression to proper placodes. NF-kappaB modulates WNT and SHH signaling at early stages of HF development, but this does not fully account for the phenotypes observed upon NF-kappaB inhibition. To identify additional NF-kappaB target genes, we developed a novel method to isolate and transcriptionally profile primary HF placodes with active NF-kappaB signaling. In parallel, we compared gene expression at the same developmental stage in NF-kappaB-deficient embryos and controls. This uncovered novel NF-kappaB target genes with potential roles in priming HF placodes for down-growth. Importantly, we identify Lhx2 (encoding a LIM/homeobox transcription factor) as a direct NF-kappaB target gene, loss of which replicates a subset of phenotypes seen in NF-kappaB-deficient embryos. Lhx2 and Tgfb2 knockout embryos exhibit very similar abnormalities in HF development, including failure of the E-cadherin suppression required for follicle down-growth. We show that TGFbeta2 signaling is impaired in NF-kappaB-deficient and Lhx2 knockout embryos and that exogenous TGFbeta2 rescues the HF phenotypes in Lhx2 knockout skin explants, indicating that it operates downstream of LHX2. These findings identify a novel NF-kappaB/LHX2/TGFbeta2 signaling axis that is crucial for primary HF morphogenesis, which may also function more broadly in development and disease.",

    "text": "Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Fetal Skin Reveals Key Genes Related to Hair Follicle Morphogenesis in Cashmere Goats. Cashmere goat skin contains two types of hair follicles (HF): primary hair follicles (PHF) and secondary hair follicles (SHF). Although multiple genetic determinants associated with HF formation have been identified, the molecules that determine the independent morphogenesis of HF in cashmere goats remain elusive. The growth and development of SHF directly influence the quantity and quality of cashmere production. Here, we report the transcriptome profiling analysis of nine skin samples from cashmere goats using 60-and 120-day-old embryos (E60 and E120, respectively), as well as newborns (NB), through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). HF morphological changes indicated that PHF were initiated at E60, with maturation from E120, while differentiation of SHF was identified at E120 until formation of cashmere occurred after birth (NB). The RNA-sequencing analysis generated over 20. 6 million clean reads from each mRNA library. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in E60 vs. E120, E120 vs. NB, and E60 vs. NB were 1, 024, 0 and 1, 801, respectively, indicating that no significant differences were found at transcriptomic levels between E120 and NB. Key genes including B4GALT4, TNC, a-integrin, and FGFR1, were up-regulated and expressed in HF initiation from E60 to E120, while regulatory genes such as GPRC5D, PAD3, HOXC13, PRR9, VSIG8, LRRC15, LHX2, MSX-2, and FOXN1 were up-regulated and expressed in HF keratinisation and hair shaft differentiation from E120 and NB to E60. Several genes belonging to the KRT and KRTAP gene families were detected throughout the three HF developmental stages. The transcriptional trajectory analyses of all DEGs indicated that immune privilege, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, and growth factor receptors all played dominant roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal interface and HF formation. We found that the Wnt, transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein, and Notch family members played vital roles in HF differentiation and maturation. The DEGs we found could be attributed to the generation and development of HF, and thus will be critically important for improving the quantity and quality of fleece production in animals for fibres.",

OBJECTIVE: Skin wound healing is a serious clinical problem especially after surgery and severe injury of the skin. Cell therapy is an innovative technique that can be applied to wound healing. One appropriate source of stem cells for therapeutic use is stem cells from the adult bulge of hair follicles. This study examined the effects of adult bulge hair follicle stem cells (HFSC) in wound healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hair follicle stem cells were obtained from rat vibrissa and labeled with DiI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), then special markers were detected using flow cytometry. A full-thickness excisional wound model was created and DiI-labeled HFSC were injected around the wound bed. Wound healing was recorded with digital photographs. Animals were sacrificed at 3, 7, or 14 days after surgery, and were used for the following histological analyses. RESULTS: Flow cytometry analysis showed that HFSC were CD34 positive and nestin positive, but K15 negative. Morphological analysis of HFSC-treated wounds exhibited accelerated wound closure. Histological analysis of hematoxylin and eosin stained and Masson ' s trichrome-stained photomicrographs showed significantly more re-epithelialization and dermal structural regeneration in HFSC-treated wounds than in the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD31 protein-positive cells showed angiogenesis was also more significant in HFSC-treated wounds than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Hair follicle stem cells accelerate skin wound healing. Isolating HFSC from a small skin biopsy could repair less-extensive full-thickness skin wounds by autologous stem cells and overcome major challenges regarding the use of stem cells in clinical application, while avoiding immune rejection and ethical concerns.",

Nestin-expressing hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells are located in the bulge area of the follicle. Previous studies have shown that HAP stem cells can differentiate to neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, and melanocytes in vitro. HAP stem cells effected nerve and spinal cord regeneration in mouse models. Recently, we demonstrated that HAP stem cells differentiated to beating cardiac muscle cells. The differentiation potential to cardiac muscle cells was greatest in the upper part of the follicle. The beat rate of the cardiac muscle cells was stimulated by isoproterenol. In the present study, we observed that isoproterenol directs HAP stem cells to differentiate to cardiac muscle cells in large numbers in culture compared to HAP stem cells not supplemented with isoproterenol. The addition of activin A, bone morphogenetic protein 4, and basic fibroblast growth factor, along with isoproternal, induced the cardiac muscle cells to form tissue sheets of beating heart muscle cells. These results demonstrate that HAP stem cells have great potential to form beating cardiac muscle cells in tissue sheets.",

Hair follicles are skin appendages that undergo periods of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen) regulated by their mesenchymal component, the dermal papilla (DP). On the basis of the reports of its specific expression in the DP, we investigated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT5) activation during hair development and cycling. STAT5 activation in the DP began in late catagen, reaching a peak in early anagen before disappearing for the rest of the cycle. This was confirmed by the expression profile of suppressor of cytokine signaling 2, a STAT5 target in the DP. This pattern of expression starts after the first postnatal hair cycle. Quantification of hair cycling using the Flash canonical Wnt signaling in vivo bioluminescence reporter found that conditional knockout of STAT5A/B in the DP targeted through Cre-recombinase under the control of the Sox18 promoter resulted in delayed anagen entry compared with control. Microarray analysis of STAT5 deletion versus control revealed key changes in tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Wnt, and fibroblast growth factor ligands, known for their role in inducing anagen entry. We conclude that STAT5 activation acts as a mesenchymal switch to trigger natural anagen entry in postdevelopmental hair follicle cycling.",

In the present study, we isolated and characterized a full-length open reading frame (ORF) of BMP4 cDNA from the skin tissue of Liaoning cashmere goat, and investigated the transcriptional pattern and methylation status of BMP4 gene in skin tissue of this breed during different stages of hair follicle cycle. The sequence analysis indicated that the isolated cDNA was 1264-bp in length containing a complete ORF of 1230-bp. It encoded a precursor peptide of 409 amino acids with a signal peptide of 19 amino acids. The structural analysis indicated that goat BMP4 contains typical TGF-beta propeptide and TGF-beta domains. In skin tissue, BMP4 is generally transcribed in an ascendant pattern from anagen to telogen. The methylation level of 5 ' flanking regulatory region of BMP4 gene might be involved in its mRNA expression in skin tissue: a higher BMP4 methylation level in skin coincides with a lower expression of BMP4 mRNA.

The maintenance of highly proliferative capacity and full differentiation potential is a necessary step in the initiation of stem cell-based regenerative medicine. Our recent study showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) significantly enhanced hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cell (HF-MSC) proliferation while maintaining the multilineage differentiation potentials. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we investigated the role of EGF in HF-MSC proliferation. HF-MSCs were isolated and cultured with or without EGF. Immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, cytochemistry, and western blotting were used to assess proliferation, cell signaling pathways related to the EGF receptor (EGFR), and cell cycle progression. HF-MSCs exhibited surface markers of mesenchymal stem cells and displayed trilineage differentiation potentials toward adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. EGF significantly increased HF-MSC proliferation as well as EGFR, ERK1/2, and AKT phosphorylation (p-EGFR, p-ERK1/2, and p-AKT) in a time-and dose-dependent manner, but not STAT3 phosphorylation. EGFR inhibitor (AG1478), PI3K-AKT inhibitor (LY294002), ERK inhibitor (U0126), and STAT3 inhibitor (STA-21) significantly blocked EGF-induced HF-MSC proliferation. Moreover, AG1478, LY294002, and U0126 significantly decreased p-EGFR, p-AKT, and p-ERK1/2 expression. EGF shifted HF-MSCs at the G1 phase to the S and G2 phase. Concomitantly, cyclinD1, phosphorylated Rb, and E2F1expression increased, while that of p16 decreased. In conclusion, EGF induces HF-MSC proliferation through the EGFR/ERK and AKT pathways, but not through STAT-3. The G1/S transition was stimulated by upregulation of cyclinD1 and inhibition of p16 expression.",

Nanoparticles with a size of several hundred nanometers can effectively penetrate into the hair follicles and may serve as depots for controlled drug delivery. However, they can neither overcome the hair follicle barrier to reach the viable cells nor release the loaded drug adequately. On the other hand, small drug molecules cannot penetrate deep into the hair follicles. Thus, the most efficient way for drug delivery through the follicular route is to employ nanoparticles that can release the drug close to the target structure upon exposure to some external or internal stimuli. Accordingly, 100-700 nm sized thermoresponsive nanogels with a phase transition temperature of 32-37 C were synthesized by the precipitation polymerization technique using N-isopropylacrylamide as a monomer, acrylated dendritic polyglycerol as a crosslinker, VA-044 as an initiator, and sodium dodecyl sulphate as a stabilizer. The follicular penetration of the indodicarbocyanine (IDCC) labeled nanogels into the hair follicles and the release of coumarin 6, which was loaded as a model drug, in the hair follicles were assessed ex vivo using porcine ear skin. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) enabled independent tracking of the nanogels and the loaded dye, although it is not as precise and accurate as standard analytical methods. The results showed that, unlike smaller nanogels (< 100 nm), medium and larger sized nanogels (300-500 nm) penetrated effectively into the hair follicles with penetration depths proportional to the nanogel size. The release of the loaded dye in the hair follicles increased significantly when the investigation on penetration was carried out above the cloud point temperature of the nanogels.

Research into how the central nervous system (CNS) and the skin of mammals are physiologically connected and how this \" \" brain-skin connection \" \" may be therapeutically targeted in clinical medicine has witnessed a renaissance. A key element in this development has been the discovery that mammalian skin and its appendages, namely human scalp hair follicles (HFs), not only are important, long-underestimated target tissues for classical neurohormones, neurotrophins and neuropeptides, but also are eminent peripheral tissue sources for the production and/or release of these neuromediators. This essay summarizes the many different levels of biology at which human scalp HFs respond to and generate a striking variety of neurohormones, and portrays HFs as prototypic, cyclically remodelled miniorgans that utilize these neurohormones to autoregulate their growth, hair shaft production, rhythmic organ transformation, pigmentation, mitochondrial energy metabolism, and immune status. The essay also explores how preclinical research on human scalp HFs can be exploited to unveil and explore \" \" novel \" \" and clinically as yet untapped, but most likely ancestral functions of neurohormones within mammalian epithelial biology that still impact substantially on human skin physiology. Arguably, systematic investigation of the \" \" brain-skin connection \" \" is one of the most intriguing current research frontiers in investigative dermatology, not the least since it has reversed the traditional CNS focus in studying the interactions between two key organ systems by placing the skin epithelium on center stage. \"",

The application of stem cells in the treatment of various degenerative diseases is highly promising. However, cell-based therapy could be limited by the problem of low viability of grafted cells and uncertainty about their fate. The combination of molecular imaging and contrast-enhanced MRI may give more insight into the survival and behavior of grafted stem cells. We explore hair-follicle-bulge-derived stem cells (HFBSCs) as a potential candidate for autologous cell-based therapy. HFBSCs are transduced with a lentiviral construct with genes coding for bioluminescent (Luc2) and fluorescent (copGFP) reporter proteins, and subsequently loaded with magnetic nanoparticles to enable MRI visualization. Thus, we investigate for the first time if lentiviral transduction and cellular loading with nanoparticles have a cytotoxic effect upon these stem cells. Transduction efficiency, proliferation rate, cell viability and reporter protein co-expression during long-term culture of transduced HFBSCs were studied using fluorescence and bioluminescence microscopy. In addition, the effect of TMSR50 nanoparticles on proliferation and viability was investigated using the MTS assay and bioluminescence microscopy. The amount of TMSR50-loaded HFBSCs needed to reach signal threshold for MRI was assessed using an agarose phantom. Transduction with the Luc2-copGFP construct did not influence senescence, proliferation, doubling time, and differentiation of the HFBSCs. CopGFP expression was visible immediately after transduction and persisted for at least 15 passages, concomitantly with Luc2 expression. Cellular loading with TMSR50 nanoparticles did not affect cell viability and proliferation. The results imply that combined MRI and bioluminescence imaging may enable in vivo localization and long-term monitoring of grafted viable HFBSCs. Copyright 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

As hair greying is the consequence of melanocyte disappearance in an oxidative stress environment, we checked whether the antioxidant capacity of the new Polygonum multiflorum Radix extract could preserve melanocyte viability in response to H2 O2-induced oxidative stress, and preserve pigmentation within ex vivo human hair follicles. RESULTS: In vitro treatment of primary human foreskin melanocytes with traditional available Polygonum multiflorum Radix extract resulted in decreased intracellular ROS accumulation in response to H2 O2 exposure with a concomitant preservation of glutathione-to-protein ratio, consistent with a protective response against H2 O2 exposure and demonstrating the promise of this extract for protecting melanocytes against oxidative stress. Melanocytes treated with the improved Polygonum multiflorum Radix extract exhibited attenuated H2 O2-induced cell death, demonstrating a clear cytoprotective effect. Treatment of ex vivo human hair follicles with the improved Polygonum multiflorum Radix extract resulted in a higher level of melanin compared to vehicle-treated controls, demonstrating an ex vivo protective effect on hair pigmentation. CONCLUSION: Polygonum multiflorum Radix extract protects in vitro primary human foreskin melanocytes from the deleterious effects of H2 O2 exposure and improves pigmentation within ex vivo human hair follicles, demonstrating the utility of Polygonum multiflorum Radix extract as a potential active ingredient for the protection of melanocytes against premature death. This data provides in vitro mechanistic evidence consistent with existing in vivo studies for the use of Polygonum multiflorum Radix extract as a strategy for the prevention of oxidative stress-induced hair greying, in line with traditional Polygonum multiflorum Radix uses.",

Panfolliculoma (PF) is a rare benign tumor with signs of differentiation toward all components of the hair follicle (HF). Cystic panfolliculoma (CPF) is a subset of PF with histological similarity to trichofolliculoma making the differential diagnosis difficult in some cases. Immunohistopathological investigations of PF have been reported ; however, previous studies focused mostly on the expression profile of the outer root sheath markers. Herein, we report a case of CPF. A panel of antibodies was developed and used for the detection of the expression of cytokeratin (CK) 10, CK13, CK14, CK15, hair-hard keratin (AE13) and EpCAM within the lesion, supporting the differentiation of all epithelial lineages of the HF and the diagnosis of CPF. Immunohistopathological examinations clearly showed the spatial distribution pattern of each subset of tumor cells with distinct HF differentiation marker expression. Intriguingly, fibroblastic dermal cells were distributed preferentially near CK15-negative epithelium or CK13-positive HF-like structures, suggesting a role for epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (EMIs) in CPF pathogenesis. Further characterization of EMIs between the tumor and surrounding mesenchymal cells in CPF may provide an explanation for immature HF differentiation. These findings suggest that the more intense and coordinated EMI in the analogous tumorigenesis gives rise to mature HF structures, resulting in trichofolliculoma, which may explain their histological resemblance.",

B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp1) is a transcriptional repressor that regulates cell growth and differentiation in multiple tissues, including skin. Although in the epidermis Blimp1 is important for keratinocyte and sebocyte differentiation, its role in dermal fibroblasts is unclear. Here we show that Blimp1 is dynamically regulated in dermal papilla cells during hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and the postnatal hair cycle, preceding dermal Wnt/beta-catenin activation. Blimp1 ablation in E12. 5 mouse dermal fibroblasts delayed HF morphogenesis and growth and prevented new HF formation after wounding. By combining targeted quantitative PCR screens with bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation we demonstrated that Blimp1 is both a target and a mediator of key dermal papilla inductive signaling pathways including transforming growth factor-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin. Epidermal overexpression of stabilized beta-catenin was able to override the HF defects in Blimp1 mutant mice, underlining the close reciprocal relationship between the dermal papilla and adjacent HF epithelial cells. Overall, our study reveals the functional role of Blimp1 in promoting the dermal papilla inductive signaling cascade that initiates HF growth.",

    "text": "Hierarchical patterning modes orchestrate hair follicle morphogenesis. Two theories address the origin of repeating patterns, such as hair follicles, limb digits, and intestinal villi, during development. The Turing reaction-diffusion system posits that interacting diffusible signals produced by static cells first define a prepattern that then induces cell rearrangements to produce an anatomical structure. The second theory, that of mesenchymal self-organisation, proposes that mobile cells can form periodic patterns of cell aggregates directly, without reference to any prepattern. Early hair follicle development is characterised by the rapid appearance of periodic arrangements of altered gene expression in the epidermis and prominent clustering of the adjacent dermal mesenchymal cells. We assess the contributions and interplay between reaction-diffusion and mesenchymal self-organisation processes in hair follicle patterning, identifying a network of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), wingless-related integration site (WNT), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling interactions capable of spontaneously producing a periodic pattern. Using time-lapse imaging, we find that mesenchymal cell condensation at hair follicles is locally directed by an epidermal prepattern. However, imposing this prepattern ' s condition of high FGF and low BMP activity across the entire skin reveals a latent dermal capacity to undergo spatially patterned self-organisation in the absence of epithelial direction. This mesenchymal self-organisation relies on restricted transforming growth factor (TGF) beta signalling, which serves to drive chemotactic mesenchymal patterning when reaction-diffusion patterning is suppressed, but, in normal conditions, facilitates cell movement to locally prepatterned sources of FGF. This work illustrates a hierarchy of periodic patterning modes operating in organogenesis.",

BACKGROUND: Cashmere growth is a seasonal and cyclic phenomenon under the control of photoperiod and multiple stimulatory and inhibitory signals. Beyond relevant coding genes, microRNA (miRNA) and long non coding RNA (lncRNA) play an indispensable role in hair follicle (HF) development and skin homeostasis. Furthermore, the influence of lncRNA upon miRNA function is also rapidly emerging. However, little is known about miRNAs, lncRNAs and their functions as well as their interactions on cashmere development and cycling. RESULT: Here, based on lncRNA and miRNA high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, we have identified 1108 lncRNAs and 541 miRNAs in cashmere goat skin during anagen and telogen. Compared with telogen, 1388 coding genes, 41 lncRNAs and 15 miRNAs were upregulated, while 1104 coding genes, 157 lncRNAs and 8 miRNAs were downregulated in anagen (adjusted P-value < = 0. 05 and relative fold-change > = 2). Subsequently, we investigated the impact of lncRNAs on their target genes in cis and trans, indicating that these lncRNAs are functionally conserved during HF development and cycling. Furthermore, miRNA-mRNA and miRNA-lncRNA interaction were identified through the bioinformatics algorithm miRanda, then the ceRNA networks, miR-221-5p-lnc _ 000679-WNT3, miR-34a-lnc _ 000181-GATA3 and miR-214-3p-lnc _ 000344-SMAD3, were constructed under defined rules, to illustrate their roles in cashmere goat HF biology. CONCLUSION: The present study provides a resource for lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA studies in cashmere cycling and development. We also demonstrate potential ceRNA regulatory networks in cashmere goat HF cycling for the first time. It expands our knowledge about lncRNA and miRNA biology as well as contributes to the annotation of the goat genome.",

Stem-cell-based repair of auditory neurons may represent an attractive therapeutic option to restore sensorineural hearing loss. Hair-follicle-bulge-derived stem cells (HFBSCs) are promising candidates for this type of therapy, because they (1) have migratory properties, enabling migration after transplantation, (2) can differentiate into sensory neurons and glial cells, and (3) can easily be harvested in relatively high numbers. However, HFBSCs have never been used for this purpose. We hypothesized that HFBSCs can be used for cell-based repair of the auditory nerve and we have examined their migration and incorporation into cochlear modiolus explants and their subsequent differentiation. Modiolus explants obtained from adult wild-type mice were cultured in the presence of EF1alpha-copGFP-transduced HFBSCs, constitutively expressing copepod green fluorescent protein (copGFP). Also, modiolus explants without hair cells were co-cultured with DCX-copGFP-transduced HFBSCs, which demonstrate copGFP upon doublecortin expression during neuronal differentiation. Velocity of HFBSC migration towards modiolus explants was calculated, and after two weeks, co-cultures were fixed and processed for immunohistochemical staining. EF1alpha-copGFP HFBSC migration velocity was fast: 80. 5 +-6. 1 mum/h. After arrival in the explant, the cells formed a fascicular pattern and changed their phenotype into an ATOH1-positive neuronal cell type. DCX-copGFP HFBSCs became green-fluorescent after integration into the explants, confirming neuronal differentiation of the cells. These results show that HFBSC-derived neuronal progenitors are migratory and can integrate into cochlear modiolus explants, while adapting their phenotype depending on this micro-environment. Thus, HFBSCs show potential to be employed in cell-based therapies for auditory nerve repair.",

The main focus of this study was elucidating the coping mechanisms of stem cells against the stimulation of constant exposure to genotoxic stresses, both endogenous and exogenous, to ensure long-term function. Investigation of various mouse strains, differing in their DNA repair capacity, enables us to clarify fractionated low-dose irradiation (LDR)-induced consequences for different stem cell populations of the murine hair follicle (HF) in their physiological stem cell niche. Using microscopic techniques combined with flow cytometry, we could show that LDR induces accumulation of persisting ; pKu70-independent 53BP1-foci (\" \" chromatin-alterations \" \") in heterochromatic regions of the HF stem cells (HFSCs). These remaining chromatin-alterations result in varying stem cell consequences. CD34-positive HFSCs react by ataxia telangiectasia mutated-dependent, premature senescence, which correlates with global chromatin compaction, whereby apoptosis is prevented by the activity of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit. However, distinctively highly damaged HFSCs seem to be sorted out of the niche by differentiation, transferring their chromatin-alterations to more proliferative G protein-coupled receptor 5-positive stem cells. Consequentially, the loss of basal HFSCs is compensated by increased proliferation within the stem cell pool. Despite the initial success of these mechanisms in stem cell population maintenance, the combined effect of the chromatin-alterations and the modification in stem cell pool composition may lead to downstream long-term functional loss of tissue or organs.

Tissue regeneration relies on resident stem cells (SCs), whose activity and lineage choices are influenced by the microenvironment. Exploiting the synchronized, cyclical bouts of tissue regeneration in hair follicles (HFs), we investigate how microenvironment dynamics shape the emergence of stem cell lineages. Employing epigenetic and ChIP-seq profiling, we uncover how signal-dependent transcription factors couple spatiotemporal cues to chromatin dynamics, thereby choreographing stem cell lineages. Using enhancer-driven reporters, mutagenesis, and genetics, we show that simultaneous BMP-inhibitory and WNT signals set the stage for lineage choices by establishing chromatin platforms permissive for diversification. Mechanistically, when binding of BMP effector pSMAD1 is relieved, enhancers driving HF-stem cell master regulators are silenced. Concomitantly, multipotent, lineage-fated enhancers silent in HF-stem cells become activated by exchanging WNT effectors TCF3/4 for LEF1. Throughout regeneration, lineage enhancers continue reliance upon LEF1 but then achieve specificity by accommodating additional incoming signaling effectors.

Our previous study indicated that loureirin A induces hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) differentiation through Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway activation. However, if and how microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) modulate loureirin A-induced differentiation remains to be elucidated. In the present study, HFSCs were separated from the vibrissae of rats and identified by CD34 and keratin, type 1 cytoskeletal (K) 15 expression. Microarray-based miRNA profiling analysis revealed that miR-339-5p was downregulated in loureirin A-induced HFSC differentiation. miR-339-5p overexpression by transfection with miR-339-5p mimics markedly inhibited the expression of K10 and involucrin, which are markers of epidermal differentiation, whereas inhibition of miR-339-5p by miR-339-5p inhibitor transfection promoted the expression of K10 and involucrin. These results suggest that miR-339-5p is a negative regulator of HFSC differentiation following induction by loureirin A. These findings were confirmed by a luciferase assay. Homeobox protein DLX-5 (DLX5) was identified as a direct target of miR-339-5p. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that miR-339-5p inhibited DLX5. Overexpression of miR-339-5p by mimic transfection significantly inhibited protein Wnt-3a (Wnt3a) expression, while inhibition of miR-339-5p by inhibitor transfection significantly increased the expression of Wnt3a. Furthermore, small interfering RNA targeting DLX5 was transfected into HFSCs, and western blot analysis revealed that Wnt3a, involucrin and K10 expression was significantly downregulated. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-339-5p negatively regulated loureirin A-induced HFSC differentiation by targeting DLX5, resulting in Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway inhibition. This may provide a possible therapeutic target for skin repair and regeneration.",

BACKGROUND: Differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into hepatocytes has important clinical significance in providing a new stem cell source for cell therapy of terminal liver disease. The differential gene expression analysis of hiPSCs, induced hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) provides valuable information for optimization of an induction scheme and exploration of differentiation mechanisms. METHODS: Human hair follicle-derived iPSCs (hHF-iPSCs) were induced in vitro by mimicking the environment of a developing liver for 19 days. Expression of specific proteins was determined by immunofluorescence staining ; the function of HLCs in storage and metabolism was identified by detecting periodic acid-Schiff, indocyanine green, and low-density lipoprotein. Based on the transcriptomics data, the differential gene expression profiles of hHF-iPSCs, HLCs, and PHHs were analyzed by Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, FunRich, and network analysis methods. RESULTS: HLCs were able to express albumin (ALB), alpha-fetoprotein, CYP3A4, and CYP7A1, and exhibited matured liver cell functions such as glycogen synthesis and storage. Complement and coagulation cascades and metabolic pathways ranked top in the downregulated list of HLCs/PHHs, while the cell cycle ranked top in the upregulated list of HLCs/PHHs. In the protein-protein interaction network, according to the degree rankings, TOP2A, CDK1, etc. were the important upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while ALB, ACACB, etc. were the major downregulated DEGs in HLCs/PHHs ; the module analysis indicated that CDCA8, AURKB, and AURKA were the top upregulated DEGs in HLCs/PHHs.

CONTEXT: Due to the wide use of improvised explosive devices during modern warfare, primary blast-derived mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has become a major medical condition in the military. With minimal visually identifiable symptoms, an effective molecular biomarker system is desirable. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the potential of mammalian hair follicle miRNAs as an mTBI biomarker. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Due to their well-established roles in mTBI molecular pathology, the expression level of miR-183, miR-26a, miR-181c, miR-29a, miR-34a and miR-27b was determined using qRT-PCR in whisker hair follicles from rats subject to head-only exposure to a single-pulse shock wave. Based on established transcriptomics profiles, sub-network enrichment analysis (SNEA) was also conducted. RESULTS: The results revealed that molecular networks involving miR-183, miR-26a and miR-181c were enriched in multiple treatments, whereas sub-networks of miR-29a, miR-34a and miR-27b were unique to individual exposure groups. DISCUSSION: Our study showed that all six miRNAs were reflective of the mTBI signature involved in cellular responses. Noteworthy was that the decrease in the transcript levels of miR-181c was correlated with shockwave exposure severity. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates for the first time that mammalian hair follicles are capable of housing miRNA biomarkers for TBI.",

How stem cells coordinately differentiate into multiple cell types is largely unclear. Recent studies underline the heterogeneity among stem cells or common progenitors, suggesting that coordination occurs at the stem cell/progenitor level1-4. Here, by tracking and manipulating the same stem cells and their progeny at the single-cell level in live mice, we uncover an unanticipated flexibility of homeostatic stem cell differentiation in hair follicles. Although stem cells have been shown to be flexible upon injury, we demonstrate that hair germ stem cells at the single-cell level can flexibly establish all of the differentiation lineages even in uninjured conditions. Furthermore, stem cell-derived hair progenitors in the structure called matrix, previously thought to be unipotent, flexibly change differentiation outcomes as a consequence of unexpected dynamic relocation. Finally, the flexible cell fate determination mechanism maintains normal differentiation and tissue architecture against an ectopic differentiation stimulus induced by Wnt activation. This work provides a model of continual fate channelling and late commitment of stem cells to achieve coordinated differentiation and robust tissue architecture.",

A tailor-made system is needed to investigate the individual differences in RHE derived from each donor. It is possible to make an individual RHE using each donor ' s keratinocytes, which are usually obtained by invasive procedures such as skin excision or biopsy. To overcome this drawback, we established an RHE model using keratinocytes derived from plucked hair follicles as a less invasive procedure under conditions without feeder cells, serum, or matrix proteins. In this chapter, we provide a method of isolation and two-dimensional (2D) culture of keratinocytes derived from adult human plucked hair follicles including the outer root sheath (ORS).

The expression of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) turns to be weakened or disappeared in hair follicles of AGA patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether VEGF is involved in the apoptosis of HFSCs induced by 5alpha-DHT in the patients of AGA. METHODS: By 5alpha-DHT, apoptosis of CD200-rich and CD34-positive HFSCs was induced and apoptotic rates up to 24 hours were assessed using flow cytometry. The expression grades of Bcl-2, Akt, caspase-3 and Bax were observed through Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Vascular endothelial growth factor could cut 5alpha-DHT induced apoptosis down substantially in a concentration-dependent manner. The 5alpha-DHT induced decline in the rise of Bcl-2/Bax proportion and the increase in caspase-3 degrees were mostly reversed by using VEGF and the VEGF ' s anti-apoptotic actions were impeded through preventing the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt.

Burn wound healing is an important issue in skin regeneration and has multiple indications for stem cell therapy.

Methods: HFSCs of the rat whisker were isolated, cultured, and labeled with DiI. Flow cytometry method was used to detect special markers of HFSCs. Deep partial-thickness burn wound was created, and labeled HFSCs were injected around the wound bed. Wound closure was recorded via digital photographs. The inflicted rats were sacrificed at 3, 7, or 14 days post burn and used for subsequent histological and tensiometry analysis. Results: Our results indicated that HFSCs were positive for Nestin and CD34 markers, but negative for Kr15. Morphological and histological photographs revealed that wound closure rate was accelerated in stem cell-treated group compared with other groups. In addition, faster re-epithelialization and collagen deposition were observed. The immunohistochemical analysis suggested that CD31 expression and vascular density enhanced in the stem cell-treated group.

Here, we compare two strategies to further promote dutasteride follicular-targeted delivery: the chemical modulation of nanosystem surface properties by coating with the natural polymer chitosan, and the application of a massage. For this, poly-(e-caprolactone)-lipid-core nanocapsules (NC) containing dutasteride were developed and had their permeation profile compared to chitosan-coated nanocapsules (NC-CS). Nanocapsules showed high drug encapsulation efficiency (> 94%), and stability for up to 90 days of storage.

Here, we show that alpha-parvin (alpha-pv), a focal adhesion protein that couples integrins to actin cytoskeleton, is indispensable for epidermal morphogenesis and HF development. Inactivation of the murine alpha-pv gene in basal keratinocytes results in keratinocyte-BM detachment, epidermal thickening, ectopic keratinocyte proliferation and altered actin cytoskeleton polarization. In vitro, alpha-pv-null keratinocytes display reduced adhesion to BM matrix components, aberrant spreading and stress fibers formation, and impaired directed migration.

Perifollicular mast cells, Tregs and other immunocytes may also contribute to HF IP maintenance in healthy human skin. Collapse of anagen hair bulb IP is an essential prerequisite for the development of alopecia areata (AA). In AA, lesional HFs are rapidly infiltrated by NKG2D + T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, while perifollicular mast cells acquire a profoundly pro-inflammatory phenotype and interact with autoreactive CD8 + T cells. Using animal models, significant functional evidence has accumulated that demonstrates the dominance of the immune system in AA pathogenesis. Purified CD8 + T-cell and NK cell populations alone, which secrete fgamma, suffice to induce the AA phenotype, while CD4 + T-cells aggravate it, and Tregs and iNKT cells may provide relative protection against AA development. While IP collapse may be induced by exogenous agents, inherent IP deficiencies might confer increased susceptibility to AA for some individuals. Thus, a key goal for effective AA management is the re-establishment of a functional HF IP, which will also provide superior protection from disease relapse. \"",

Hair follicles are easily accessible skin appendages that protect against cold and potential injuries. Hair follicles contain various pools of stem cells, such as epithelial, melanocyte, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that continuously self-renew, differentiate, regulate hair growth, and maintain skin homeostasis. Recently, MSCs derived from the dermal papilla or dermal sheath of the human hair follicle have received attention because of their accessibility and broad differentiation potential. In this review, we describe the applications of human hair follicle-derived MSCs (hHF-MSCs) in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. We have described protocols for isolating hHF-MSCs from human hair follicles and their culture condition in detail. We also summarize strategies for maintaining hHF-MSCs in a highly proliferative but undifferentiated state after repeated in vitro passages, including supplementation of growth factors, 3D suspension culture technology, and 3D aggregates of MSCs. In addition, we report the potential of hHF-MSCs in obtaining induced smooth muscle cells and tissue-engineered blood vessels, regenerated hair follicles, induced red blood cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells. In summary, the abundance, convenient accessibility, and broad differentiation potential make hHF-MSCs an ideal seed cell source of regenerative medical and cell therapy.",

This article explores and summarizes recent progress in and the characterization of main players in the regulation and cyclic regeneration of hair follicles. The review discusses current views and discoveries on the molecular mechanisms that allow hair follicle stem cells (hfSCs) to synergistically integrate homeostasis during quiescence and activation. Discussion elaborates on a model that shows how different populations of skin stem cells coalesce intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, resulting in the maintenance of stemness and hair regenerative potential during an organism ' s lifespan. Primarily, we focus on the question of how the intrinsic oscillation of gene networks in hfSCs sense and respond to the surrounding niche environment. The review also investigates the existence of a cell-autonomous mechanism and the reciprocal interactions between molecular signaling axes in hfSCs and niche components, which demonstrates its critical driving force in either the activation of whole mini-organ regeneration or quiescent homeostasis maintenance. These exciting novel discoveries in skin stem cells and the surrounding niche components propose a model of the intrinsic stem cell oscillator which is potentially instructive for translational regenerative medicine. Further studies, deciphering of the distribution of molecular signals coupled with the nature of their oscillation within the stem cells and niche environments, may impact the speed and efficiency of various approaches that could stimulate the development of self-renewal and cell-based therapies for hair follicle stem cell regeneration.",

    "text": "Back to the Future: From Appendage Development Toward Future Human Hair Follicle Neogenesis. Hair disorders such as alopecia and hirsutism often impact the social and psychological well-being of an individual. This also holds true for patients with severe burns who have lost their hair follicles (HFs). HFs stimulate proper wound healing and prevent scar formation ; thus, HF research can benefit numerous patients. Although hair development and hair disorders are intensively studied, human HF development has not been fully elucidated. Research on human fetal material is often subject to restrictions, and thus development, disease, and wound healing studies remain largely dependent on time-consuming and costly animal studies. Although animal experiments have yielded considerable and useful information, it is increasingly recognized that significant differences exist between animal and human skin and that it is important to obtain meaningful human models. Human disease specific models could therefore play a key role in future therapy. To this end, hair organoids or hair-bearing skin-on-chip created from the patient ' s own cells can be used. To create such a complex 3D structure, knowledge of hair genesis, i. e., the early developmental process, is indispensable. Thus, uncovering the mechanisms underlying how HF progenitor cells within human fetal skin form hair buds and subsequently HFs is of interest. Organoid studies have shown that nearly all organs can be recapitulated as mini-organs by mimicking embryonic conditions and utilizing the relevant morphogens and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Therefore, knowledge of the cellular and ECM proteins in the skin of human fetuses is critical to understand the evolution of epithelial tissues, including skin appendages. This review aims to provide an overview of our current understanding of the cellular changes occurring during human skin and HF development. We further discuss the potential implementation of this knowledge in establishing a human in vitro model of a full skin substitute containing hair follicles and the subsequent translation to clinical use.",

One of the drawbacks preventing the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in clinical practice is the heterogeneous nature of their cultures. MSC cultures are not homogeneously formed by the MSCs and may contain non-mesenchymal cell types. Therefore, prior to use in clinics or research, complete characterization of MSCs should be performed to demonstrate the existence or absence of proper stem cell markers, many of which are happened to be cell-surface proteins. Unfortunately, the success of MSC characterization studies is limited due to the low specificity of the currently available cell-surface markers. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the plasma membrane (PM) proteins of MSCs isolated from human dental pulp (DP), adipose tissue (AT), bone marrow (BM), and hair follicle (HF) with the hope of proposing novel putative specific MSC markers. Differential-velocity centrifugation was used to enrich PM proteins. The isolated proteins were then identified by nLC-MS/MS and subjected to bioinformatics analysis.

Hair follicle (HF) regeneration remains challenging, principally due to the absence of a platform that can successfully generate the microenvironmental cues of hair neogenesis. Here, we demonstrate a 3D bioprinting technique based on a gelatin/alginate hydrogel (GAH) to construct a multilayer composite scaffold simulating the HF microenvironment in vivo. Fibroblasts (FBs), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), dermal papilla cells (DPCs), and epidermal cells (EPCs) were encapsulated in GAH (prepared from a mixture of gelatin and alginate) and respectively 3D-bioprinted into the different layers of a composite scaffold. The bioprinted scaffold with epidermis-and dermis-like structure was subsequently transplanted into full-thickness wounds in nude mice. The multilayer scaffold demonstrated suitable cytocompatibility and increased the proliferation ability of DPCs (1. 2-fold ; P < 0. 05). It also facilitated the formation of self-aggregating DPC spheroids and restored DPC genes associated with hair induction (ALP, beta-catenin, and alpha-SMA). The dermal and epidermal cells self-assembled successfully into immature HFs in vitro. HFs were regenerated in the appropriate orientation in vivo, which can mainly be attributed to the hierarchical grid structure of the scaffold and the dot bioprinting of DPCs. Our 3D printed scaffolds provide a suitable microenvironment for DPCs to regenerate entire HFs and could make a significant contribution in the medical management of hair loss. This method may also have broader applications in skin tissue (and appendage) engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Hair loss remains a challenging clinical problem that influences quality of life. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has become a useful tool for the fabrication of tissue constructs for transplantation and other biomedical applications. In this study, we used a 3D bioprinting technique based on a gelatin/alginate hydrogel to construct a multi-layer composite scaffold with cuticular and corium layers to simulate the microenvironment of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) in the human body. This new approach permits the controllable formation of self-aggregating spheroids of DPCs in a physiologically relevant extracellular matrix and the initiation of epidermal-mesenchymal interactions, which results in HF formation in vivo. The ability to regenerate entire HFs should have a significant impact on the medical management of hair loss.",

In this study, we investigated whether lymphatic endothelial cells might secrete paracrine factors that activate dermal papilla cells in vitro. We found that Sostdc1 was more expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells compared with blood vascular endothelial cells. In addition, Sostdc1 expression levels were significantly increased during the anagen phase in the back skin of C57BL/6J mice, as compared to the telogen phase. We also observed that incubation of dermal papilla cells with 200 ng/mL Sostdc1 for 72 h induced the expression levels of Lef-1, a downstream target of Wnt signaling.

Caspase-3 downregulation was also detected by immunofluorescence, Western blot and RT-PCR in the hair follicle of the mutant mice. After intradermal injection of Gsdma3 gene expression plasmid, apoptosis as well as Caspase-3 expression in the hair follicle of mutant mice was enhanced, and so the catagen retardation of Gsdma3-mutant mice was rescued.

    "text": "Inhibition of BMP signaling in P-Cadherin positive hair progenitor cells leads to trichofolliculoma-like hair follicle neoplasias. BACKGROUND: Skin stem cells contribute to all three major lineages of epidermal appendages, i. e., the epidermis, the hair follicle, and the sebaceous gland. In hair follicles, highly proliferative committed progenitor cells, called matrix cells, are located at the base of the follicle in the hair bulb. The differentiation of these early progenitor cells leads to specification of a central hair shaft surrounded by an inner root sheath (IRS) and a companion layer. Multiple signaling molecules, including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), have been implicated in this process. METHODS: To further probe the contribution of BMP signaling to hair follicle development and maintenance we employed a transgenic mouse that expresses the BMP inhibitor, Noggin, to disrupt BMP signaling specifically in subset of hair follicle progenitors under the control of neuron specific enolase (Nse) promoter. We then studied the skin tumor phenotypes of the transgenic mice through histology, immunohistochemistry and Western Blotting to delineate the underlying mechanisms. Double transgenic mice expressing BMP as well as noggin under control of the Nse promoter were used to rescue the skin tumor phenotypes. RESULTS: We found that the transgene is expressed specifically in a subpopulation of P-cadherin positive progenitor cells in Nse-Noggin mice. Blocking BMP signaling in this cell population led to benign hair follicle-derived neoplasias resembling human trichofolliculomas, associated with down-regulation of E-cadherin expression and dynamic regulation of CD44. CONCLUSIONS: These observations further define a critical role for BMP signaling in maintaining the homeostasis of hair follicles, and suggest that dysregulation of BMP signaling in hair follicle progenitors may contribute to human trichofolliculoma.",

Tissue development and regeneration depend on cell-cell interactions and signals that target stem cells and their immediate progeny. However, the cellular behaviours that lead to a properly regenerated tissue are not well understood. Using a new, non-invasive, intravital two-photon imaging approach we study physiological hair-follicle regeneration over time in live mice. By these means we have monitored the behaviour of epithelial stem cells and their progeny during physiological hair regeneration and addressed how the mesenchyme influences their behaviour. Consistent with earlier studies, stem cells are quiescent during the initial stages of hair regeneration, whereas the progeny are more actively dividing. Moreover, stem cell progeny divisions are spatially organized within follicles. In addition to cell divisions, coordinated cell movements of the progeny allow the rapid expansion of the hair follicle. Finally, we show the requirement of the mesenchyme for hair regeneration through targeted cell ablation and long-term tracking of live hair follicles. Thus, we have established an in vivo approach that has led to the direct observation of cellular mechanisms of growth regulation within the hair follicle and that has enabled us to precisely investigate functional requirements of hair-follicle components during the process of physiological regeneration.",

To elucidate the role of MED1 in keratinocytes, we established keratinocyte-specific Med1-null (Med1 (epi-/-)) mice using the K5Cre/LoxP system. Development of the epidermis and appendages of Med1 (epi-/-) mice were macroscopically and microscopically normal until the second catagen of the hair cycle. However, the hair cycle of Med1 (epi-/-) mice was spontaneously repeated after the second telogen, which does not occur in wild-type (WT) mice. Hair follicles of Med1 (epi-/-) mice could not enter anagen after 6 months of age, resulting in sparse pelage hair in older Med1 (epi-/-) mice. Interfollicular epidermis (IFE) of Med1 (epi-/-) mice was acanthotic and more proliferative than that of WT mice, whereas these findings were less evident in older Med1 (epi-/-) mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the numbers of hair follicle bulge stem cells were reduced in Med1 (epi-/-) mice from a few months after birth. These results suggest that MED1 has roles in maintaining quiescence of keratinocytes and preventing depletion of the follicular stem cells.",

In this study, we investigated the developmental and transcriptional response of skin and hair to changes in RAS activity, using mouse genetic models and microarray analysis. While activation of Kras (Kras (G12D)) in the skin had strong effects on hair growth and hair shape, steady state changes in downstream RAS/MAPK effectors were subtle and detected only by transcriptional responses. To model the transcriptional response of multiple developmental pathways to active RAS, the effects of growth factor stimulation were studied in skin explants. Here FGF acutely suppressed Shh transcription within 90 min but had significantly less effect on Eda, WNT, Notch or BMP pathways. Furthermore, in vivo Fgfr2 loss-of-function in the ectoderm caused derepression of Shh, revealing a role for FGF in Shh regulation in the hair follicle.

Here we describe a method of labeling and subsequent tracking stem cells of the hair follicle bulge region in mouse skin. Hair follicle stem cells are specifically labeled by expressing the Cre recombinase under control of keratin15 (K15) regulatory sequences and by crossing the Cre-containing animals with Cre-sensitive Rosa26R (R26R) reporter mice. To achieve a temporal control of recombinase activity in stem cells, Cre is fused to a modified estrogen receptor (CreER (G) T2).

By analyzing the skin tissue at different time points following genetic labeling, important information on stem cell behavior and contribution of labeled stem cells to epidermal structures during tissue homeostasis and hair follicle regeneration are obtained.

The activation of tissue stem cells from their quiescent state represents the initial step in the complex process of organ regeneration and tissue repair. While the identity and location of tissue stem cells are becoming known, how key regulators control the balance of activation and quiescence remains mysterious. The vertebrate hair is an ideal model system where hair cycling between growth and resting phases is precisely regulated by morphogen signaling pathways, but how these events are coordinated to promote orderly signaling in a spatial and temporal manner remains unclear. Here, we show that hair cycle timing depends on regulated stability of signaling substrates by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Topical application of partial proteasomal inhibitors (PaPIs) inhibits epidermal and dermal proteasome activity throughout the hair cycle. PaPIs prevent the destruction of the key anagen signal beta-catenin, resulting in more rapid hair growth and dramatically shortened telogen. We show that PaPIs induce excess beta-catenin, act similarly to the GSK3beta antagonist LiCl, and antagonize Dickopf-related protein-mediated inhibition of anagen. PaPIs thus represent a novel class of hair growth agents that act through transiently modifying the balance of stem cell activation and quiescence pathways.",

    "text": "Protease activity, localization and inhibition in the human hair follicle. OBJECTIVE: In humans, the process of hair shedding, referred to as exogen, is believed to occur independently of the other hair cycle phases. Although the actual mechanisms involved in hair shedding are not fully known, it has been hypothesized that the processes leading to the final step of hair shedding may be driven by proteases and/or protease inhibitor activity. In this study, we investigated the presence of proteases and protease activity in naturally shed human hairs and assessed enzyme inhibition activity of test materials. METHODS: We measured enzyme activity using a fluorescence-based assay and protein localization by indirect immunohistochemistry (IHC). We also developed an ex vivo skin model for measuring the force required to pull hair fibres from skin. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate the presence of protease activity in the tissue material surrounding club roots. We also demonstrated the localization of specific serine protease protein expression in human hair follicle by IHC. These data provide evidence demonstrating the presence of proteases around the hair club roots, which may play a role during exogen. We further tested the hypothesis that a novel protease inhibitor system (combination of Trichogen) and climbazole) could inhibit protease activity in hair fibre club root extracts collected from a range of ethnic groups (U. K., Brazil, China, first-generation Mexicans in the U. S. A., Thailand and Turkey) in both males and females. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this combination is capable of increasing the force required to remove hair in an ex vivo skin model system. CONCLUSION: These studies indicate the presence of proteolytic activity in the tissue surrounding the human hair club root and show that it is possible to inhibit this activity with a combination of Trichogen and climbazole.

The nestin-expressing hair follicle stem cells can effect nerve and spinal cord repair upon transplantation in mouse models. In the present study, nestin-expressing hair follicle stem cells expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP) were induced by retinoic acid and fetal bovine serum to differentiate and then transplanted together with Matrigel into the transected distal sciatic or tibial nerve stump of transgenic nude mice ubiquitously expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Control mice were transplanted with Matrigel only. The transplanted cells appeared neuron like, with large round nuclei and long extensions. Immunofluorescence staining showed that some of the transplanted cells in the distal nerve stump expressed the neuron marker Tuj1 as well as motor neuron markers Isl 1/2 and EN1. These transplanted cells contacted each other as well as host nerve fibers. Two weeks post-transplantation, nerve fibers in the distal sciatic nerve stump of the transplanted mice had greater expression of motor neuron markers and neurotrophic factor-3 than those in the Matrigel-only transplanted mice. Muscle fiber areas in the nestin-expressing stem cell plus Matrigel-transplanted animals were much bigger than that in the Matrigel-only transplanted animals after 4 weeks.

De novo organ regeneration has been observed in several lower organisms, as well as rodents ; however, demonstrating these regenerative properties in human cells and tissues has been challenging. In the hair follicle, rodent hair follicle-derived dermal cells can interact with local epithelia and induce de novo hair follicles in a variety of hairless recipient skin sites. However, multiple attempts to recapitulate this process in humans using human dermal papilla cells in human skin have failed, suggesting that human dermal papilla cells lose key inductive properties upon culture. Here, we performed global gene expression analysis of human dermal papilla cells in culture and discovered very rapid and profound molecular signature changes linking their transition from a 3D to a 2D environment with early loss of their hair-inducing capacity. We demonstrate that the intact dermal papilla transcriptional signature can be partially restored by growth of papilla cells in 3D spheroid cultures. This signature change translates to a partial restoration of inductive capability, and we show that human dermal papilla cells, when grown as spheroids, are capable of inducing de novo hair follicles in human skin.",

PURPOSE: The effects of ionizing radiations on somatic stem cells largely remain to be studied. Hair follicles are self-renewing structures that reconstitute themselves throughout the hair cycle, which is comprised of the following phases: Anagen (growth), catagen (regression) and telogen (resting), suggesting the presence of their own stem cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The whole bodies of C57BL/10JHir mice in the 1st telogen phase were irradiated with gamma-rays. Mice were examined for effects on hair follicles, including their number, morphology and pigmentation in the 2nd anagen phase. RESULTS: Decreased hair follicle density and induction of curved hair follicles were observed in the dermal skin of irradiated mice. In addition to these keratinocyte-derived anomalies, melanocyte-derived anomalies including white hair and hypopigmented hair bulbs were found. The decrease in hair follicle density and the increase in the frequency of hypopigmented hair bulbs were dependent on the dose of gamma-rays. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that gamma-rays damage stem cells and progenitors for keratinocytes and melanocytes, thereby affecting the structure and character of regenerated hair follicles. The density of hair follicles and pigment production in hair bulbs are established as criteria for the effects of gamma-rays on the hair cycle.",

Hair follicle morphogenesis depends on Wnt, Shh, Notch, BMP and other signaling pathways interplay between epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The Wnt pathway plays an essential role during hair follicle induction, Shh is involved in morphogenesis and late stage differentiation, Notch signaling determines stem cell fate while BMP is involved in cellular differentiation. The Wnt pathway is considered to be the master regulator during hair follicle morphogenesis. Wnt signaling proceeds through EDA/EDAR/NF-kappaB signaling. NF-kappaB regulates the Wnt pathway and acts as a signal mediator by upregulating the expression of Shh ligand. Signal crosstalk between epithelial and mesenchymal cells takes place mainly through primary cilia. Primary cilia formation is initiated with epithelial laminin-511 interaction with dermal beta-1 integrin, which also upregulates expression of downstream effectors of Shh pathway in dermal lineage. PDGF signal transduction essential for crosstalk is mediated through epithelial PDGF-A and PDGFRalpha expressed on the primary cilia. Dermal Shh and PDGF signaling up-regulates dermal noggin expression ; noggin is a potent inhibitor of BMP signaling which helps in counteracting BMP mediated beta-catenin inhibition. This interplay of signaling between the epithelial and dermal lineage helps in epithelial Shh signal amplification. The dermal Wnt pathway helps in upregulation of epithelial Notch expression. Dysregulation of these pathways leads to certain abnormalities and in some cases even tumor outgrowth.",

BACKGROUND: Some vitiligo lesions are resistant to all medical treatments. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare the efficacy of hair follicle transplantation and mini-punch grafting for the treatment of refractory vitiligo lesions. METHODS: A total of 25 patients with stable and resistant vitiligo participated in the study. In each patient, a resistant vitiligo patch was divided into 2 equal parts. One part was treated with hair follicle transplantation and the other part with mini-punch grafting. Postsurgically, the recipient areas were exposed to narrowband ultraviolet B twice a week for 6 months. The diameter of the repigmentation around each graft was measured monthly. RESULTS: At the end of the sixth month, 68% of follicle grafts, and 72% of mini-punch grafts, had repigmentation. The mean diameter of repigmentation around follicle grafts was 5 +-1. 7 mm and around punch grafts was 5. 3 +-1. 6 mm. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups statistically (P =. 18). LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and short time of follow-up are limitations. CONCLUSIONS: Because the results of the 2 methods are not statistically different and mini-punch grafting is much easier to do than follicular transplantation, we recommend mini-punch grafting to treat drug-resistant vitiligo.",

Hair follicles (HFs) upon development enter a lifelong cycle of growth, regression, and resting. These phases have been extensively studied at the cellular and molecular levels for individual HFs. However, HFs group into domains with coordinated cycling strongly influenced by their environment. These macroscopic hair domains have been difficult to study and can be influenced by physiological or pathological conditions, such as pregnancy or skin wounds. To robustly address this issue, we generated a mouse model for quantitative monitoring of beta-catenin activity reflecting HF cycle dynamics macroscopically by using live bioluminescence imaging. These mice allowed live tracking of HF cycles and development, and highlighted hair regenerative patterns known to occur through macro-environmental cues, including initiation events, propagating anagen and border stability, and allowed refinement of a mechanistic mathematical model that integrates epidermal cell population dynamics into an excitable reaction-diffusion model. HF cycling could be studied in situations of pregnancy, wound healing, hair plucking, as well as in response to cyclosporine or Wnt3a stimulation. In conclusion, we developed a model for analysis of HF cycling at the macroscopic level that will allow refined analysis of hair cycle kinetics as well as its propagation dynamics.",

Whereas, hair follicle stem cells (HFSC), which are affected in with neurogenic potential, it might to hypothesize that this multipotent cell compartment is the predominant source of seladin-1. Our aim was to evaluate seladin-1 gene expression in hair follicle stem cells.

Next, 9-11-day cells were evaluated for seladin-1 gene expression by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Our results indicated that expression of the seladin-1 gene (DHCR24) on days 9, 10, and 11 may contribute to the development of HFSC. However, the expression of this gene on day 11 was more than day 10 and on 10th day was more than day 9. Also, we assessed HFSC on day 14 and demonstrated these cells were positive for beta-sh tubulin, and seladin-1 was not expressed in this day.

Hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and cycling are a result of intricate autonomous epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Once the first HF cycle is complete it repeatedly undergoes cyclic transformations. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix where they influence a variety of biological processes by interacting with physiologically important proteins, such as growth factors. Inhibition of heparanase (an HS endoglycosidase) in in vitro cultured HFs has been shown to induce a catagen-like process. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the precise role of HS in HF morphogenesis and cycling. An inducible tetratransgenic mouse model was generated to excise exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 (Ext1) in keratin 14-positive cells from P21. Interestingly, EXT1 (StEpiDelta/StEpiDelta) mice presented solely anagen HFs. Moreover, waxing the fur to synchronize the HFs revealed accelerated hair regrowth in the EXT1 (StEpiDelta/StEpiDelta) mice and hindered cycling into catagen. The ablation of HS in the interfollicular epidermal cells of mature skin led to the spontaneous formation of new HFs and an increase in Sonic Hedgehog expression resembling wild-type mice at P0, thereby indicating that the HS/Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates HF formation during embryogenesis and prevents HF formation in mature skin. Finally, the knock-out of HS also led to the morphogenesis and hyperplasia of sebaceous glands and sweat glands in mature mice, leading to exacerbated sebum production and accumulation on the skin surface. Therefore, our findings clearly show that an intricate control of HS levels is required for HF, sebaceous gland, and sweat gland morphogenesis and HF cycling.",

We focus on such a noninvasively available source of adult stem cells that we carry with us throughout our life, available at our fingertips-or shall we say hair roots, by a simple plucking of hair: the human hair follicle. This chapter describes an explant procedure for cultivating melanocytes differentiated from the stem cell pool of the hair follicle Outer Root Sheath (ORS).

We have taken advantage of the ORS developmental potential by optimizing explant primary culture, expansion and melanogenic differentiation of resident ORS stem cells towards end-stage melanocytes in order to obtain functional melanocytes noninvasively for the purposes of transplantation and use them for the treatment of depigmentation disorders. Our protocol specifies sampling of hair with their ORS, follicle medium-air interface primary culture, stimulation of cell outgrowth, adherent culture and differentiation of ORS stem cells and precursors towards fully functional melanocytes.

BACKGROUND: Spiradenoma and cylindroma have historically been described as sweat gland tumors and have often been considered to be of eccrine lineage. However, (a) associations with trichoepitheliomas in Brooke-Spiegler syndrome or with trichoepitheliomas and milia in Rasmussen syndrome, (b) neoplastic combinations with hair follicle tumors in solitary cases, and (c) anatomical considerations support a folliculosebaceous-apocrine lineage. Follicular stem cell markers may allow for further characterization of these neoplasms. METHODS: A total of 97 tumors were examined for the expression pattern of follicular stem cell markers cytokeratin 15 (CK15), cytokeratin 19 (CK19), pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 1 (PHLDA1), and CD200. The tumors were comprised of 27 spiradenomas, 30 cylindromas, 16 hidradenomas, 19 poromas, 4 dermal duct tumors and 1 hidroacanthoma simplex. RESULTS: All spiradenomas and cylindromas were CD200-positive whereas the other tumors classified as eccrine in lineage were all CD200-negative. CK15 also discriminated between spiradenomas and cylindromas and the remaining neoplasms but not to the degree of CD200. PHLDA1 and CK19 were noncontributory.

Mice with skin and hair follicle (HF) defects are common models of human skin disorders. A mutant strain with the we/we wal/wal genotype develops alopecia.

Although these mice lose their hair at 21 days, a label-retaining cell population persists in HFs until at least day 54. Depilation-induced anagen was accomplished in we/we wal/wal mutants but the resulting hair shafts were short and extremely deformed. Serious abnormalities in epidermis stratification and HF morphogenesis exist in we/we wal/wal homozygous E18. 5 embryos. There were significantly fewer HF primordia in this mutant compared with wild type. We discovered specific structures, identified as invalid placodes, positive for ectodysplasin A1 receptor, nuclear beta-catenin, and LEF1, which failed to invaginate, produced a double basal-like layer of epidermal cells, and lacked cylindrical keratinocytes. Specification of dermal papillae (DP) was impaired, and the papillary dermis expressed alkaline phosphatase and LEF1. We also detected DP-like groups of intensively stained cells in the absence of visible signs of folliculogenesis in the epidermis. We showed differentiation disturbances in the mutant embryonic E18. 5 epidermis and HFs: The cornified layer was absent, the width of the spinous layer was reduced, and HFs lacked LEF1-positive precortex cells. In this study, we used a very interesting and useful mouse model of alopecia. The presence of symptoms of skin disorders in we/we wal/wal murine embryos correlates with the postnatal skin phenotype.

This process is linked to distinct gene expression, including Wnt transcription. Interestingly, by mimicking this event through the selective induction of macrophage apoptosis in early telogen, we identify a novel involvement of macrophages in stem cell activation in vivo. Importantly, the macrophage-specific pharmacological inhibition of Wnt production delays hair follicle growth. Thus, perifollicular macrophages contribute to the activation of skin epithelial stem cells as a novel, additional cue that regulates their regenerative activity.

OBJECTIVE: Hair follicles are widely recognized as the preferential target and site of accumulation for nanoparticles after topical application. This feature is of particular importance for hair cosmetics, having the potential to refine the treatment of several hair follicle-related disorders. The aim of this work was to improve the preparation of Poly (D, L-lactide) (PLA) nanoparticles for in vivo follicular target and drug delivery. METHODS: Envisaging a future industrial scale-up of the process, nanoprecipitation method was used to prepare PLA nanoparticles: the effect of several processing parameters on their properties was examined and the yield of nanoparticles formation determined. Encapsulation efficiencies and in vitro release profiles of lipophilic and hydrophilic model compounds were also assessed. In vitro cytotoxicity and ex vivo penetration studies were performed on a reference skin cell line (NCTC2455, human skin keratinocytes) and porcine skin, respectively. RESULTS: Using acetone: ethanol (50: 50, v/v) as the solvent phase, 0. 6% (w/w) of Pluronic () F68 as a surfactant agent and agitation to mix the solvent and non-solvent phases, a monodispersed population of non-cytotoxic spherical nanoparticles of approximately 150 nm was obtained. The yield of nanoparticles for this formulation was roughly 90%. After encapsulation of model compounds, no significant changes were found in the properties of particles and the entrapment efficiencies were above 80%. The release kinetics of dyes from PLA nanoparticles indicate an anomalous transport mechanism (diffusion and polymer degradation) for Nile Red (lipophilic) and a Fickian diffusion of first order for fluorescein 5 (6)-isothiocyanate (hydrophilic). Ex vivo skin penetration studies confirmed the presence of nanoparticles along the entire follicular ducts. CONCLUSIONS: The optimized method allows the preparation of ideal PLA nanoparticles-based formulations for hair follicle targeting. PLA nanoparticles can effectively transport and release lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds into the hair follicles, and the yields obtained are acceptable for industrial purposes.",

    "text": "Thyroid hormone signaling controls hair follicle stem cell function. Observations in thyroid patients and experimental animals show that the skin is an important target for the thyroid hormones. We previously showed that deletion in mice of the thyroid hormone nuclear receptors TRalpha1 and TRbeta (the main thyroid hormone-binding isoforms) results in impaired epidermal proliferation, hair growth, and wound healing. Stem cells located at the bulges of the hair follicles are responsible for hair cycling and contribute to the regeneration of the new epidermis after wounding. Therefore a reduction in the number or function of the bulge stem cells could be responsible for this phenotype. Bulge cells show increased levels of epigenetic repressive marks, can retain bromodeoxyuridine labeling for a long time, and have colony-forming efficiency (CFE) in vitro. Here we demonstrate that mice lacking TRs do not have a decrease of the bulge stem cell population. Instead, they show an increase of label-retaining cells (LRCs) in the bulges and enhanced CFE in vitro. Reduced activation of stem cells leading to their accumulation in the bulges is indicated by a strongly reduced response to mobilization by 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate. Altered function of the bulge stem cells is associated with aberrant activation of Smad signaling, leading to reduced nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, which is crucial for stem cell proliferation and mobilization. LRCs of TR-deficient mice also show increased levels of epigenetic repressive marks. We conclude that thyroid hormone signaling is an important determinant of the mobilization of stem cells out of their niche in the hair bulge. These findings correlate with skin defects observed in mice and alterations found in human thyroid disorders.",

Ceramides are crucial for skin barrier function, but little is known about the regulation of epidermal appendages and whether stem cell populations that control their regeneration depend on specific ceramide species. Here we demonstrate that ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4) is highly expressed in the epidermis of adult mice where it is localized in the interfollicular epidermis and defined populations within the pilosebaceous unit. Inactivation of CerS4 in mice resulted in precocious activation of hair follicle bulge stem cells while expanding the Lrig1 (+) junctional zone and sebaceous glands. This was preceded first by a decrease in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and a subsequent increase in Wnt signaling. This imbalance in quiescent versus activating signals likely promoted a prolonged anagen-like hair follicle state after the second catagen, which exhausted stem cells over time ultimately resulting in hair loss in aged mice. K14-Cre-mediated deletion of CerS4 revealed a similar phenotype, thus suggesting an epidermis intrinsic function of CerS4 in regulating the regeneration of the pilosebaceous unit. The data indicate that CerS4-directed epidermal ceramide composition is essential to control hair follicle stem and progenitor cell behavior potentially through its regulation of BMP and Wnt signaling.",

Interposition of cells into the companion layer must cause increase of its volume and additional volume supposed to be led away into the pillar canal around the hair near the sebaceous glands orifices.

Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in the bugle circularly generate outer root sheath (ORS) through linear proliferation within limited cycles during anagen phases.

Here we revealed that Foxp1, a transcriptional factor, was dynamically relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of HFSCs in phase transitions from anagen to catagen, coupled with the rise of oxidative stress. Mass spectrum analyses revealed that the S468 phosphorylation of Foxp1 protein was responsive to oxidative stress and affected its nucleocytoplasmic translocation. Foxp1 deficiency in hair follicles led to compromised ROS accrual and increased HFSC proliferation. And more, NAC treatment profoundly elongated the anagen duration and HFSC proliferation in Foxp1-deficient background. Molecularly, Foxp1 augmented ROS levels through suppression of Trx1-mediated reductive function, thereafter imposing the cell cycle arrest by modulating the activity of p19/p53 pathway.

By comparing the fates of several keratinocyte lineages, we observed here an initial decrease in both HF-and IFE-derived cells within the transient acanthotic layers of the regenerating epithelium. At the same time, the relative abundance of early-arriving IFE-derived cells specifically in the wound basal layer declined as later-arriving HF-derived cells entered the site of injury. Although laggard bulge-derived cells were typically constrained at the regenerative periphery, these cells persisted in the wound basal layer. Finally, suppressing Notch enabled IFE-derived cells to out-compete HF-derived cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that IFE-, HF-and bulge-derived cells make distinct contributions to regeneration over time.

We investigated assembly strategies for the interactions of dermal papilla (DP) cells with adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in promoting hair formation. DP cells lose DP traits during adherent culture, but preserved DP markers with a unified sphere diameter by seeding on chitosan-coated microenvironments. Next, ASCs isolated from rats were co-cultured with DP spheres by different assembling approaches to determine their interactions ; a mixed sphere of ASCs with DP cells (MA-DPS), or a core-shell structure, outer ASCs shell and an inner DP core (CSA-DPS). CSA-DPS exhibited superior DP characteristics compared to MA-DPS. Conditional medium from ASCs, but not differentiated adipocytes, promoted DP markers and functional alkaline phosphatase activity from the DP cells. In vivo patch assay showed the core-shell assembling of CSA-DPS can reconstruct cellular arrangements and microenvironmental niches as dominated by PPARalpha signal in ASCs to induce the greater hair induction than MA-DPS or DP spheres alone. Therefore, the assembling of a core-shell sphere for DP with ASCs could reconstruct the HF cellular arrangement for hair formation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine an efficient expression strategy in Arabidopsis thaliana and to determine whether a dimeric oleosin fusion approach could achieve keratinocyte growth factor-2 (KGF2) expression and bioactivity. RESULTS: Higher recombinant protein accumulation was observed in the two dimeric oleosin constructs than in a single-oleosin-fused protein (O:: KGR2) or KGF2 control. Highest expression was in O-O:: KGF2-transgenic seeds. MTT assay in FGFR2 III b-BaF3 cells revealed comparable levels of bioactivity due to O-O:: KGF2 and O:: KGR2, whereas O:: KGF2-O had no effect on FGFR2 III b-BaF3 opithelial cell growth. The transgenic proteins had a pronounced stimulatory effect on hair follicle proliferation in C57BL/6 mice. CONCLUSION: A dimeric oleosin approach can be used to express KGF2 with the non-symmetrical O-O:: KGF2 construct showing the highest expression and bioactivity.",

Initiation of hair follicle (HF) is the first and most important stage of HF morphogenesis. However the precise molecular mechanism of initiation of hair follicle remains elusive. Meanwhile, in previous study, the more attentions had been paid to the function of genes, while the roles of non-coding RNAs (such as long noncoding RNA and microRNA) had not been described. Therefore, the roles of long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) and coding RNA in sheep skin during the initiation of sheep secondary HF were integrated and analyzed, by using strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq). A total of 192 significant differentially expressed genes were detected, including 67 up-regulated genes and 125 down-regulated genes between stage 0 and stage 1 of HF morphogenesis during HF initiation. Only Wnt2, FGF20 were just significant differentially expressed among Wnt, Shh, Notch and BMP signaling pathways. Further expression profile analysis of lncRNAs showed that 884 novel lncRNAs were discovered in sheep skin expression profiles. A total of 15 lncRNAs with significant differential expression were detected, 6 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated. Among of differentially expressed genes and LncRNA, XLOC002437 lncRNA and potential target gene COL6A6 were all significantly down-regulated in stage 1. Furthermore, by using RNAhybrid, XLOC005698 may be as a competing endogenous RNA ' ' sponges \" \" oar-miR-3955-5p activity. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that the significantly enriched pathway was peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) pathway (corrected P-value < 0. 05), indicating that PPAR pathway is likely to play significant roles during the initiation of secondary HF. Results suggest that the key differentially expressed genes and LncRNAs may be considered as potential candidate genes for further study on the molecular mechanisms of HF initiation, as well as supplying some potential values for understanding human hair disorders. \"",

Secretory phospholipase A2 Group-IIA (sPLA2-IIA) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids to yield fatty acids and lysophospholipids. sPLA2-IIA is deregulated in various cancers ; however, its role in hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) regulation is obscure. Here we report a transgenic mice overexpressing sPLA2-IIA (K14-sPLA2-IIA) showed depletion of HFSC pool. This was accompanied with increased differentiation, loss of ortho-parakeratotic organization and enlargement of sebaceous gland, infundibulum and junctional zone. The colony forming efficiency of keratinocytes was significantly reduced. Microarray profiling of HFSCs revealed enhanced level of epithelial mitogens and transcription factors, c-Jun and FosB that may be involved in proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, K14-sPLA2-IIA keratinocytes showed enhanced activation of EGFR and JNK1/2 that led to c-Jun activation, which co-related with enhanced differentiation. Further, depletion of stem cells in bulge is associated with high levels of chromatin silencing mark, H3K27me3 and low levels of an activator mark, H3K9ac suggestive of alteration in gene expression contributing toward stem cells differentiation. Our results, first time uncovered that overexpression of sPLA2-IIA lead to depletion of HFSCs and differentiation associated with altered histone modification.

    "text": "Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Reveals that a Ubiquitin-Mediated Proteolysis Pathway Is Important for Primary and Secondary Hair Follicle Development in Cashmere Goats. BACKGROUND: The fleece of cashmere goats contains two distinct populations of fibers, a short and fine non-medullated insulating cashmere fiber and a long and coarse medullated guard hair. The former is produced by secondary follicles (SFs) and the later by primary follicles (PFs). Evidence suggests that the induction of PFs and SFs may require different signaling pathways. The regulation of BMP2/4 signaling by noggin and Edar signaling via Downless genes are essential for the induction of SFs and PFs, respectively. However, these differently expressed genes of the signaling pathway cannot directly distinguish between the PFs and SFs. RESULTS: In this study, we selected RNA samples from 11 PFs and 7 SFs that included 145, 525 exons. The pathway analysis of 4512 differentially expressed exons revealed that the most statistically significant metabolic pathway was related to the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway (UMPP) (P < 3. 32x 10-7). In addition, the 51 exons of the UMPP that were differentially expressed between the different types of hair follicle (HFs) were compared by cluster analysis. This resulted in the PFs and SFs being divided into two classes. The expression level of two selected exons was analyzed by qRT-PCR, and the results indicated that the expression patterns were consistent with the deep sequencing results obtained by RNA-Seq. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the comparative transcriptome analysis of 18 HFs from cashmere goats, a large number of differentially expressed exons were identified using a high-throughput sequencing approach. This study suggests that UMPP activation is a prominent signaling pathway for distinguishing the PFs and SFs of cashmere goats. It is also a meaningful contribution to the theoretical basis of the biological study of the HFs of cashmere goats and other mammals.",

Despite recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of ectodermal dysplasias (EDs), the molecular basis of many of these disorders remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed at elucidating the genetic basis of a new form of ED featuring facial dysmorphism, scalp hypotrichosis and hypodontia. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified 2 frameshift and 2 missense mutations in TSPEAR segregating with the disease phenotype in 3 families. TSPEAR encodes the thrombospondin-type laminin G domain and EAR repeats (TSPEAR) protein, whose function is poorly understood. TSPEAR knock-down resulted in altered expression of genes known to be regulated by NOTCH and to be involved in murine hair and tooth development. Pathway analysis confirmed that down-regulation of TSPEAR in keratinocytes is likely to affect Notch signaling. Accordingly, using a luciferase-based reporter assay, we showed that TSPEAR knock-down is associated with decreased Notch signaling. In addition, NOTCH1 protein expression was reduced in patient scalp skin. Moreover, TSPEAR silencing in mouse hair follicle organ cultures was found to induce apoptosis in follicular epithelial cells, resulting in decreased hair bulb diameter. Collectively, these observations indicate that TSPEAR plays a critical, previously unrecognized role in human tooth and hair follicle morphogenesis through regulation of the Notch signaling pathway.",

Alopecia is an exceedingly prevalent problem that lacks effective therapy. Recently, research has focused on early-passage dermal papilla cells (DPCs), which have hair inducing activity both in vivo and in vitro. Our previous study indicated that factors secreted from early-passage DPCs contribute to hair follicle (HF) regeneration. To identify which factors are responsible for HF regeneration and why late-passage DPCs lose this potential, we collected 48-h-culture medium (CM) from both of passage 3 and 9 DPCs, and subcutaneously injected the DPC-CM into NU/NU mice. Passage 3 DPC-CM induced HF regeneration, based on the emergence of a white hair coat, but passage 9 DPC-CM did not. In order to identify the key factors responsible for hair induction, CM from passage 3 and 9 DPCs was analyzed by iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic technology. We identified 1360 proteins, of which 213 proteins were differentially expressed between CM from early-passage vs. late-passage DPCs, including SDF1, MMP3, biglycan and LTBP1. Further analysis indicated that the differentially-expressed proteins regulated the Wnt, TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways, which directly and indirectly participate in HF morphogenesis and regeneration. Subsequently, we selected 19 proteins for further verification by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) between the two types of CM. These results indicate DPC-secreted proteins play important roles in HF regeneration, with SDF1, MMP3, biglycan, and LTBP1 being potential key inductive factors secreted by dermal papilla cells in the regeneration of hair follicles.",

Almost all organisms maintain a circadian clock from birth to death to synchronize their own physiology and behavior with the earth ' s rotation. Because the in vivo evaluation of human circadian characteristics is labor-intensive, in vitro or ex vivo approaches could provide advantages. In this study, to enable the simple and non-invasive evaluation of autonomous circadian oscillation, we established a method for monitoring clock gene expression by performing ex vivo culture of whole hair root tissue. This method is extremely simple and imposes little burden on subjects. Results obtained using Cryptochrome-deficient mice support that circadian period length in hair tissue correlates with intrinsic period length observed in physiology and behavior. We then applied this method to old-old subjects with severe dementia, who showed abnormal circadian behavior, and found that their peripheral clocks autonomously oscillated in a manner similar to those of healthy or younger subjects, indicating that the effect of cellular senescence on the autonomous clock oscillator is limited at least in some cell types. Although further validation may be required, the hair tissue-based culture assay would be a tool to investigate intrinsic circadian characteristics in humans.",

METHODS: Data were collected using databases and resources of PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, MEDLINE and their references from the earliest available published to identify English observational studies on hair follicle bulge region. RESULTS: Bulge stem cells are pluripotent with high proliferative capacity. Specific markers allow the bulge cells to be isolated from mouse or human hair follicle. Stem cells isolated from bulge region are label retaining and slow cycling hence these cells are defined as label-retaining cells. Bulge cell populations, due to their plasticity nature are able to differentiate into distinct linage and could contribute in tissue regeneration.

Low level laser therapy is widely used to relieve pain and inflammation, and to restore cellular functions. The photons of light are absorbed by mitochondria in cells, leading to an increase in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nitric oxide release, blood flow, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study proposed the use of a laser diode array at 808 nm to stimulate the proliferation and to activate the functions of dermal papilla cells, which were an important part of the hair growth cycle. These cells were isolated from human hair follicles and were exposed to 808 nm light at various doses from 0. 5, 1, 2. 5, 4, and 6 J/cm2. The rate of cell proliferation and the gene expression profile of dermal papilla cells were investigated and compared with the control in which the cells did not received any light treatment. The growth curves of the dermal papilla cells were used to determine the specific growth rates. Higher specific growth rates were observed in the cells exposed to laser at doses higher than 0. 5 J/cm2. The effect of the laser light treatment on several gene markers, specifically for dermal papilla cells, was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Our result shows that collagen type 1 (Col1), alkaline phosphatase (Alp), and versican (Vcan) did not increase when the cells were irradiated by the laser light. Interestingly, sex determining region y-box 2 (Sox2) gene was up-regulated when 0. 5 J/cm2, and 1 J/cm2 light was used, while an increase in the level of fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) gene was observed with light irradiation at 0. 5 J/cm2, 1 J/cm2, 2. 5 J/cm2, and 4 J/cm2.

Drug delivery systems that target the pilosebaceous unit (PSU) selectively could improve the clinical management of diseases that originate in the hair follicle. The aims of this study were (i) to prepare polymeric micelles using d-alpha-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate diblock copolymer that incorporated adapalene (ADA), a retinoid indicated for Acne vulgaris, and (ii) to investigate the feasibility of delivering ADA preferentially to the PSU under finite dose conditions-thereby better approximating actual conditions of use by patients. Incorporation of ADA into spherical micelles (dn < 20 nm) increased aqueous solubility by ~ 50 000-fold (from < 4 ng mL-1 to 0. 2 mg mL-1). Optimized micelle solution and gel formulations (0. 02% ADA) were stable after storage for 4 weeks at 4 C. Finite dose experiments using full-thickness porcine and human skin revealed that ADA delivery efficiency from micelle solution and gel formulations was equivalent and was > 2-and 10-fold higher than that from Differin gel and Differin cream (products containing ADA at 0. 1% (w/w)). Follicular delivery studies in human skin, using a punch biopsy technique to extract the intact PSU, demonstrated that the micelle solution and gel formulations did indeed enable preferential delivery of ADA to the PSU (4. 5-and 3. 3-fold higher, respectively, than that to PSU-free skin biopsies). Confocal laser scanning microscopy provided visual corroboration that ADA was uniformly distributed in the hair follicles. In conclusion, the results confirmed that polymeric micelle nanocarriers enabled selective, targeted drug delivery to the PSU under finite dose conditions and so might improve therapy of follicular diseases and decrease off-site side-effects.",

Here we show that expression of Hoxc genes is sufficient to reprogram mesenchymal DP cells and alter the regenerative potential of epithelial stem cells. Hoxc gene expression in adult skin dermis closely correlates with regional HF regeneration patterns. Disrupting the region-specific expression patterns of Hoxc genes, by either decreasing their epigenetic repression via Bmi1 loss or inducing ectopic interactions of the Hoxc locus with an active epigenetic region, leads to precocious HF regeneration. We further show that a single Hoxc gene is sufficient to activate dormant DP niches and promote regional HF regeneration through canonical Wnt signaling. Altogether, these results reveal that Hoxc genes bestow mesenchymal niches with tissue-level heterogeneity and plasticity.",

Mesenchymal stem cell therapy (MSCT) has been suggested as a new therapeutic strategy for immunological disorders. There have been only a few attempts to treat alopecia areata (AA) with MSCT. MSCT efficacy and mechanism of action in treating AA are not known. We sought to investigate the effect of human hematopoietic mesenchymal stem cells (hHMSCs) on an in vitro model of AA and to explore relevant mechanisms that regulate efficacy. An AA-like environment was induced by pretreatment of human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) with interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). hHMSCs were administered to the hDPCs, and cell viability was determined. Similar studies were also conducted with human hair follicles (HFs) in culture. The change in expression of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and JAK/STAT pathway-related molecules and growth factors in hHMSC-treated hDPCs was also examined by reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot assay and growth factor array. Immune privilege-related molecules were examined by immunohistochemistry in HF culture models. hHMSCs enhanced the cell viability of the hDPCs. hHMSCs activated several molecules in the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway, including ss-catenin and phosphorylated GSK3b, and decreased IFN-gamma-induced expression of DKK1 in hDPCs. hHMSCs suppressed IFN-gamma-induced expression of caspase-1, caspase-3 and IFN-gamma receptor. hHMSCs induced the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 compared to controls and IFN-gamma-pretreated hDPCs. hHMSC-treated HFs enhanced several growth factor mRNAs. hHMSC pretreatment modulated IFN-gamma-induced expression of molecules related to HF immune privilege on HFs in organ culture. These data suggest MSCT may be a new potential therapeutic option in treating AA.",

Mammalian wounds typically heal by fibrotic repair without hair follicle (HF) regeneration. Fibrosis and regeneration are currently considered the opposite end of wound healing. This study sought to determine if scar could be remodeled to promote healing with HF regeneration. Here, we identify that activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway reinstalls a regenerative dermal niche, called dermal papilla, which is required and sufficient for HF neogenesis (HFN). Epidermal Shh overexpression or constitutive Smoothened dermal activation results in extensive HFN in wounds that otherwise end in scarring. While long-term Wnt activation is associated with fibrosis, Shh signal activation in Wnt active cells promotes the dermal papilla fate in scarring wounds. These studies demonstrate that mechanisms of scarring and regeneration are not distant from one another and that wound repair can be redirected to promote regeneration following injury by modifying a key dermal signal.",

For the past ten years, we have evaluated the role of Tbeta4 by establishing a flock of 15 cashmere goats that specifically overexpress the Tbeta4 gene in the hair follicles. These Tbeta4 overexpression (Tbeta4-OE) cashmere goats had more secondary hair follicles than the WT goats and produced more cashmere. Meanwhile, combined analysis of the skin transcriptome and proteome in cashmere goats suggested that Tbeta4 may affect hair growth by interacting with keratin type II cytoskeletal 4 epidermal (KRT4) to mediate the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, thereby promoting the development of secondary hair follicles, and consequently, increasing cashmere yield. Thus, the specific overexpression of Tbeta4 in the hair follicles of cashmere goats effectively increased the cashmere yield.",

The spleen and cecum weight of the CB group was greater than those of the WS and control groups (p < 0. 05). The redness (Commission Internationale de l ' Eclairage a *) of the meat sample of the control group was lower than those of the enriched cage groups (p < 0. 05). Moreover, the hue value of the CB group was significantly lower than that of the other groups (p < 0. 05). The tenderest meat belonged to the CB group. In addition, more secondary (p < 0. 05) and primary follicles were found in the CB group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Environmental enrichment increased the average daily gain and improved some carcass traits, meat quality, and hair follicle density. Among the three environmental enrichment materials, CB could be recommended for rabbit husbandry.",

Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic and debilitating inflammatory condition related to a permanent obstruction of the pilosebaceous units. Until nowadays, therapeutic options are unsatisfactory. Here, we propose nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) entrapping an association of clindamycin phosphate (CDM) and rifampicin (RIF) as a topical alternative for the treatment of the disease. Chemical compatibility between the drugs was demonstrated using thermal analysis combined with ATR-FTIR and X-ray powder diffraction assays. Nanocarriers ' diameter was narrowly distributed (polydispersity index = 0. 2) around 400 +-14 nm, they possess a negative surface charge (-48. 9 +-0. 7 mV) and high drug entrapment efficiencies (80. 2 +-0. 4% and 93. 4 +-0. 7% for CDM and RIF, respectively). The formulation proved to be safe for the topical application, as it was non-irritant on both HET-CAM and reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) assays. Spin-label EPR indicated an NLC affinity for the lipidic domains of stratum corneum, which could benefit the targeting of the sebaceous units. Indeed, when applied on the skin in vitro, even when mimicking the sebaceous condition, NLC accumulated into the hair follicles openings, not altering the amount of accumulated CDM and significantly increasing by 12-fold the uptake of RIF in these structures. In conclusion, developed NLC formulation incorporating the antibiotics CDM and RIF is a promising strategy for the topical treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa or other infections that may affect the pilosebaceous units.",

Although bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have been shown to promote cutaneous wound healing, they cannot functionally promote wound healing with the recovery of appendages such as hair follicles. We previously found that growth factor plus BM-MSCs could effectively promote wound healing and hair follicle regeneration. In the present study, we grafted insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a multifunctional cell growth factor, and BM-MSCs into a collagen-chitosan scaffold to investigate their effects on functional wound healing. Using scanning electron microscopy, histological staining, and quantitative analysis, we found that IGF1-and BM-MSC-incorporating collagen-chitosan scaffolds promote cutaneous wound healing with effective regeneration of hair follicles in a rat full-thickness skin injury model. In addition, IGF1/BM-MSCs inhibit inflammatory cytokines during wound healing. In vitro, we found that IGF1 promotes the proliferation and migration of BM-MSCs via the IGFR-mediated ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Collectively, in this study, we first demonstrated that IGF1 enhances BM-MSC-mediated wound healing as well as hair follicle regeneration. Our data suggest that the topical application of IGF1 and BM-MSCs incorporated in collagen-chitosan scaffolds can be used as a feasible and effective therapeutic approach to improve functional cutaneous wound healing.",

Introduction: Adult stem cell function has been one of the most intensively explored areas of biological and biomedical research, with hair follicle stem cells serving as one of the best model systems. This study explored the role of the transcription factor DLX5 in regulating hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) differentiation. Methods: HFSCs were isolated, characterized, and assessed for their expression of DLX5, c-MYC, NSD1, and miR-29c-3p using RT-qPCR, Western blot analysis, or immunofluorescence. Next, the ability of HFSCs to proliferate as well as differentiate into either sebaceous gland cells or epidermal cells was determined. The binding of DLX5 to the c-MYC promoter region, the binding of c-MYC to the miR-29c-3p promoter region, and the binding of miR-29c-3p to the 3 '-UTR of NSD1 mRNA were verified by luciferase activity assay and ChIP experiments. Results: DLX5 was highly expressed in differentiated HFSCs. DLX5 transcriptionally activated c-MYC expression to induce HFSC differentiation. c-MYC was able to bind the miR-29c-3p promoter and thus suppressed its expression. Without miR-29c-3p mediated suppression, NSD1 was then able to promote HFSC differentiation. These in vitro experiments suggested that DLX5 could promote HFSC differentiation via the regulation of the c-MYC/miR-29c-3p/NSD1 axis. Discussion: This study demonstrates that DLX5 promotes HFSC differentiation by modulating the c-MYC/miR-29c-3p/NSD1 axis and identifies a new mechanism regulating HFSC differentiation.",

CircRNA-1967 was found in secondary hair follicles (SHFs) of cashmere goats, but its functions are not clear. Here, we showed that both circRNA-1967 and its host gene BNC2 had significantly higher expression in SHF bulge at anagen than those at telogen of cashmere goats.

Tissues and organs undergo structural deterioration and functional decline during aging. DNA damage is considered a major cause of stem cell senescence. Although stem cells develop sophisticated DNA repair systems, when the intrinsic and extrinsic insults exceed the DNA repair capacity, cellular senescence, and age-related diseases inevitably occur. Therefore, the prevention and alleviation of DNA damage is an alternative to DNA repair in attenuating stem cell senescence and preventing age-related diseases. Pre-B-cell leukaemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) participates in maintaining the pluripotency of human embryonic and haematopoietic stem cells. Our recent studies showed that PBX1 promotes hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cell (HF-MSC) proliferation, decreases cellular senescence and apoptosis, and enhances induced pluripotent stem cell generation. Whether PBX1 attenuates HF-MSC senescence and apoptosis by alleviating DNA damage or by enhancing DNA repair remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of PBX1 on the intrinsic ROS or extrinsic H2O2-induced cellular senescence of HF-MSCs. To this end, we generated HF-MSCs overexpressing either PBX1, or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, or both. Our results showed that PBX1 overexpression attenuates HF-MSC senescence and apoptosis by alleviating reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage instead of enhancing DNA repair. This is the first study to report that PBX1 attenuates stem cell senescence and apoptosis by alleviating DNA damage. It provides new insight into the mechanism of stem cell senescence and lays the foundation for the development of strategies for age-related disease prevention and treatment, and in particular, hair follicle repair and regeneration.",

An exploding public health crisis is the exponential growth in the incidence of chronic nonhealing ulcers associated with diseases such as diabetes. Various modalities have been developed to stimulate wound closure that is otherwise recalcitrant to standard clinical treatments. However, these approaches primarily focus on the process of re-epithelialization and are often deficient in regenerating the full spectrum of structures necessary for normal skin function. Autologous hair follicle grafting is a recent therapy to stimulate the closure of such nonhealing wounds, and we observed effects beyond the epidermis to other important components of the dermis. We found that hair follicle grafting facilitated the reappearance of various undifferentiated and differentiated layers of the epidermis with the restoration of epidermal junctions. In addition, other important structures that are critical for cutaneous health and function such as the blood and lymph vasculature, nerve fibers, and sweat gland structures were restored in postgrafted wounds. Interestingly, both immune cells and inflammatory signals were substantially decreased, indicating a reduction in the chronic inflammation that is a hallmark of nonhealing wounds.

Liver cirrhosis (LC) involves multiple systems throughout the body, and patients with LC often die of multiple organ failure. However, few drugs are useful to treat LC. Hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells (HF-MSCs) are derived from the dermal papilla and the bulge area of hair follicles and are pluripotent stem cells in the mesoderm with broad prospects in regenerative medicine. As an emerging seed cell type widely used in skin wound healing and plastic surgery, HF-MSCs show considerable prospects in the treatment of LC due to their proliferation and multidirectional differentiation capabilities. We established an LC model in C57BL/6J mice by administering carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and injected HF-MSCs through the tail vein to explore the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of HF-MSCs on LC. Here, we found that HF-MSCs improved liver function and ameliorated the liver pathology of LC. Notably, PKH67-labeled HF-MSCs were detected in the injured liver and expressed the hepatocyte-specific markers cytokeratin 18 (CK18) and albumin (ALB). In addition, in contrast to that in the LC group, the alpha-SMA expression showed a decreasing trend in the treatment group in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the pathological activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was inhibited by HF-MSC treatment. Moreover, the levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) and p-Smad3, a signaling molecule downstream of TGF-beta1, were increased in mice with LC, while HF-MSC treatment reversed these changes in vivo and in vitro.

Androgenetic alopecia is a multifactorial condition characterized by noticeable hair loss, affecting both men and women and representing a debilitating and chronic disorder that considerably affects the quality of life. Available topical treatments based on minoxidil or finasteride require repeated applications and are associated with a certain number of adverse effects. The challenges associated with current treatments pave the way for the research of new therapeutic strategies, more precise and selective, and capable of providing long-term results. In this context, the present review examines the new proposed formulation strategies to deliver 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors in order to obtain a targeted drug delivery, for improving drug retention at the site of action in the hair follicle, contemporaneously reducing drug systemic absorption, which is the cause of important adverse effects. In particular, the research will be focused on the several aspects that influence the performance of nanostructured drug delivery systems in creating a depot in the hair follicles, such as particle size, surface charge, excipients, and combined application with external stimuli (infrared radiation, mechanical massage, ultrasounds application).",

Androgenic alopecia is a hair loss disease mediated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and is currently treated using minoxidil, finasteride, or low-level laser therapy. However, these treatments have side-effects, indicating the need for an alternative treatment. In the present study, it was demonstrated that inaudible sound at 30 kHz significantly induced proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects in human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and outer root sheath keratinocytes. Cell viability assay, ELISA, reverse transcription quantitative PCR and TUNEL assays were performed to evaluate the effect of inaudible sound. Inaudible sound was also demonstrated to significantly inhibit the hair loss signals induced by DHT treatment in hDPCs. Furthermore, inaudible sound significantly induced hair follicle (HF) elongation and hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation in human HF organ culture. Overall, the results suggested that inaudible sound may be effective in treating hair loss and could be used to develop a new hair loss treatment approach.",

    "text": "Alpinetin promotes hair regeneration via activating hair follicle stem cells. BACKGROUND: Alopecia affects millions of individuals globally, with hair loss becoming more common among young people. Various traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) have been used clinically for treating alopecia, however, the effective compounds and underlying mechanism are less known. We sought to investigate the effect of Alpinetin (AP), a compound extracted from Fabaceae and Zingiberaceae herbs, in hair regeneration. METHODS: Animal model for hair regeneration was mimicked by depilation in C57BL/6J mice. The mice were then topically treated with 3 mg/ml AP, minoxidil as positive control (PC), or solvent ethanol as vehicle control (VC) on the dorsal skin. Skin color changes which reflected the hair growth stages were monitored and pictured, along with H & E staining and hair shaft length measurement. RNA-seq analysis combined with immunofluorescence staining and qPCR analysis were used for mechanism study. Meanwhile, Gli1CreERT2 ; R26RtdTomato and Lgr5EGFP-CreERT2 ; R26RtdTomato transgenic mice were used to monitor the activation and proliferation of Gli1 + and Lgr5 + HFSCs after treatment. Furthermore, the toxicity of AP was tested in keratinocytes and fibroblasts from both human and mouse skin to assess the safety. RESULTS: When compared to minoxidil-treated and vehicle-treated control mice, topical application of AP promoted anagen initiation and delayed catagen entry, resulting in a longer anagen phase and hair shaft length. Mechanistically, RNA-seq analysis combined with immunofluorescence staining of Lef1 suggested that Lgr5 + HFSCs in lower bulge were activated by AP via Wnt signaling. Other HFSCs, including K15 +, Lef1 +, and Gli1 + cells, were also promoted into proliferating upon AP treatment. In addition, AP inhibited cleaved caspase 3-dependent apoptosis at the late anagen stage to postpone regression of hair follicles. More importantly, AP showed no cytotoxicity in keratinocytes and fibroblasts from both human and mouse skin. CONCLUSION: This study clarified the effect of AP in promoting hair regeneration by activating HFSCs via Wnt signaling. Our findings may contribute to the development of a new generation of pilatory that is more efficient and less cytotoxic for treating alopecia.",

    "text": "A Drug Free, Hair Follicle Cycling Regulatable, Separable, Antibacterial Microneedle Patch for Hair Regeneration Therapy. The development of painless hair loss therapy without side-effect is challenging. The dermal papilla is the signal center of hair follicles and plays a key role in the regulation of their cycling. Activation of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) would promote hair regeneration. In this study, a separable microneedle patch comprised of chitosan lactate (CL) and exosomes (EXO) from adipose-derived stem cells is fabricated for hair regeneration. After the insertion of the microneedle into the skin, the hyaluronic acid substrate dissolves fast and the swellable polyvinyl alcohol needle tips are retained. The EXO sustainedly released from needle tips could be endocytosed by DPCs and promote cell proliferation via the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, while the L-lactate released by CL could promote cell growth by activating lactate dehydrogenase. CL and EXO synergetically facilitate hair regeneration through regulating hair follicle cycling. In animal tests, compared with topical administration of minoxidil, the self-administration of drug-free microneedle patches could more significantly promote hair regeneration within 7 days with lower dosing frequency. Furthermore, the inherent antibacterial properties of CL make it possible to avoid potential infection. Such transdermally administrated drug-free microneedle patches provide a simple, safe and efficient strategy for hair loss treatment and exhibit great potential in clinical application.

    "text": "Cell Population Dynamics in Wound-Induced Hair Follicle Neogenesis Model. Hair follicle (HF) regeneration can be achieved in the center of large full-thickness wounds on mouse backs (wound-induced HF neogenesis model, WIHN). Investigations with this model have allowed for the identification of some of the factors limiting the extent of fibrosis, which creates a permissive environment for the reposition of HF. For WIHN, specific subpopulations of cells rather than cell types are permissive to this process. Detailed information on the cellular composition in WIHN is not available. Here, we provide a description of changes in cell numbers of fibroblasts, HF dermal papilla, endothelial cells, keratinocytes (interfollicular epidermis, HF-infundibulum, HF-isthmus, HF-bulge (basal and suprabasal), HF-hair germ) and immune cells (macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, T cells (CD4 +, CD8 +, CD4 +/CD8 +, regulatory T cells) and neutrophils) based on flow cytometric analysis. We compared unwounded skin with large wounds (1. 5 x 1. 5 cm) at different time points after wounding. We found that non-immune dermal cells have the largest share in the skin at all time points studied, and that the number of epidermal cells started increasing nine days after wounding, which precede isthmus cells and bulge cells, mirroring the development of hair follicles. Monocytes and neutrophils represent most myeloid cells in wounds and remain in wounds even beyond the inflammatory phase of wound healing. Macrophages can be identified as inflammatory and alternative cells and are also found in wounds even in the late remodeling phase of wound healing. Lastly, we provide information about T cells in large wounds. Most T cells in the wounds were CD8 + at all time points and expressed gammadeltaTCR, which was previously thought to be expressed mainly on CD4 +. We also report the existence of double positive CD4/CD8. Our study provides a guide in terms of time points suitable for the further study of cell subpopulations aiming to dissect the cellular heterogeneity in WIHN. Our results might set the base for the comparison of WIHN between control mice and animals manipulated to influence HF neogenesis and the full understanding of the responsible actors allowing for HF regeneration.",

    "text": "Does collapse of immune privilege in the hair-follicle bulge play a role in the pathogenesis of primary cicatricial alopecia ? BACKGROUND: The hair-follicle bulge has recently been added to a growing list of human tissue compartments that exhibit a complex combination of immunosuppressive mechanisms, termed immune privilege (IP), which seem to restrict immune-mediated injury in specific locations. As epithelial hair-follicle stem cells (eHFSC) reside in the hair-follicle bulge region, it is conceivable that these IP mechanisms protect this vital compartment from immune-mediated damage, thereby ensuring the ongoing growth and cyclic regeneration of the hair follicle. Primary cicatricial alopecias (PCA) are a group of inflammatory hair disorders that result in hair-follicle destruction and permanent alopecia. Growing evidence suggests that eHFSC destruction is a key factor in the permanent follicle loss seen in these conditions. AIM: To explore the possible role of bulge IP collapse in PCA pathogenesis. METHODS: We report three clinically distinct cases of PCA. Immunohistochemical analyses of paired biopsies from lesional and uninvolved scalp skin were compared using recognized markers of IP. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical investigation found increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and II and of beta2-microglobulin in the bulge region of lesional follicles compared with uninvolved follicles in each case. Further, expression of the bulge marker keratin 15 was reduced in lesional skin in two of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: This small series represents our first preliminary attempts to ascertain whether bulge IP collapse may play a role in PCA pathogenesis. We present standard parameters relating to hair-follicle IP in the bulge region of three patients with distinct PCA variants, and show the presence of features consistent with bulge IP collapse in each case.",

    "text": "Abnormal hair follicle development and altered cell fate of follicular keratinocytes in transgenic mice expressing DeltaNp63alpha. The transcription factor p63 plays an essential role in epidermal morphogenesis. Animals lacking p63 fail to form many ectodermal organs, including the skin and hair follicles. Although the indispensable role of p63 in stratified epithelial skin development is well established, relatively little is known about this transcriptional regulator in directing hair follicle morphogenesis. Here, using specific antibodies, we have established the expression pattern of DeltaNp63 in hair follicle development and cycling. DeltaNp63 is expressed in the developing hair placode, whereas in mature hair its expression is restricted to the outer root sheath (ORS), matrix cells and to the stem cells of the hair follicle bulge. To investigate the role of DeltaNp63 in hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling, we have utilized a Tet-inducible mouse model system with targeted expression of this isoform to the ORS of the hair follicle. DeltaNp63 transgenic animals display dramatic defects in hair follicle development and cycling, eventually leading to severe hair loss. Strikingly, expression of DeltaNp63 leads to a switch in cell fate of hair follicle keratinocytes, causing them to adopt an interfollicular epidermal (IFE) cell identity. Moreover, DeltaNp63 transgenic animals exhibit a depleted hair follicle stem-cell niche, which further contributes to the overall cycling defects observed in the mutant animals.

Mice null for the Vitamin D receptor (VdrKO) have a disrupted first hair follicle cycle and aborted subsequent hair follicle cycling. We examined the expression of different markers and mediators of hair follicle cycling in the hair follicle of the VdrKO mouse during days 13-22 when the hair follicle normally initiates and completes the first catagen. We compared the expression of those genes in mice with a nonsense mutation in hairless (Rhino), which have a similar alopecia phenotype, and to Cyp27b1 null mice which are deficient in the production of 1, 25 (OH) 2D3, the Vdr ligand, but display normal hair follicle cycling. Our results demonstrate the down regulation of hair follicle markers and the alteration of expression of hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, Fgf, and Tgfbeta pathways in VdrKO and Rhino mice, but not in Cyp27b1KO mice. Treatment of VdrKO mice with an agonist to the Hh pathway partially restored hair follicle cycling, suggesting a role of this pathway in the regulation of hair follicle cycling by VDR. These results suggest that Vdr regulates directly or indirectly the expression of genes required for hair follicle cycling, including Hh signaling, independent of 1, 25 (OH) 2D3.",

Nestin-expressing hair follicle stem cells can form neurons and other cell types, and thus adult hair follicle stem cells could have important therapeutic applications, particularly for neurologic diseases. Transplanted hair follicle stem cells promote the functional recovery of injured peripheral nerve and spinal cord. Recent findings suggest that direct transplantation of hair-follicle stem cells without culture can promote nerve repair, which makes them potentially clinically practical. Human hair follicle stem cells as well as mouse hair follicle stem cells promote nerve repair and can be applied to test the hypothesis that human hair follicle stem cells can provide a readily available source of neurologically therapeutic stem cells. The use of hair follicle stem cells for nerve regeneration overcomes critical problems of embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells in that the hair follicle stem cells are multipotent, readily accessible, non-oncogenic, and are not associated with ethical issues.",

BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that large (> 1 cm) diameter circular cutaneous wounds induce follicular neogenesis in mice. However, the effects of non-circular wounds or smaller circular wounds on the hair follicle cycle remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether non-circular wounds or smaller (< = 1 cm) circular wounds could induce early entry of hair follicle stem cells into anagen. METHODS: We created different shaped and sized full-thickness incisional wounds on the dorsal skin of 6-wk old mice (BALB/c, C57BL/6, and CD1), and then assessed for hair growth, wound contraction rates, and growth factor and/or immunomodulatory cytokine involvement. RESULTS: By day 16 and through day 26 post-wounding, we observed hair growth in the skin around the wound, but not in distant unwounded skin of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, CD1 mice showed hair growth in both the wounded and unwounded skin. In all mice, the hair growth pattern was independent of wound type. The area of hair growth induced by a 2 cm linear wound was roughly 2-fold that induced by a 1 cm linear wound and 4-fold that of a 0. 5 cm linear wound. Increased gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity was observed in hair follicles growing in the wounded area as well as an up to 8-fold upregulation of Wnt-and Shh-dependent signaling, consistent with anagen growth. CONCLUSION: Our data strongly support that small cutaneous wounds induce telogen to anagen transition of murine hair follicle stem cells.",

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), also known as common baldness, is characterized by a marked decrease in hair follicle size, which could be related to the loss of hair follicle stem or progenitor cells. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed bald and non-bald scalp from AGA individuals for the presence of hair follicle stem and progenitor cells. Cells expressing cytokeratin15 (KRT15), CD200, CD34, and integrin, alpha6 (ITGA6) were quantitated via flow cytometry. High levels of KRT15 expression correlated with stem cell properties of small cell size and quiescence. These KRT15 (hi) stem cells were maintained in bald scalp samples. However, CD200 (hi) ITGA6 (hi) and CD34 (hi) cell populations--which both possessed a progenitor phenotype, in that they localized closely to the stem cell-rich bulge area but were larger and more proliferative than the KRT15 (hi) stem cells--were markedly diminished. In functional assays, analogous CD200 (hi) Itga6 (hi) cells from murine hair follicles were multipotent and generated new hair follicles in skin reconstitution assays.

BACKGROUND: In vivo confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) is a recently developed non-invasive technique for visualizing microscopic structures with the skin. CSLM has been used to characterize proliferative and inflammatory skin diseases, neoplastic skin lesions and pigmented lesions. OBJECTIVE: Here, we assessed the ability of CSLM to evaluate the formation of neogenic hair follicles after a full-thickness wound in mice. METHODS: Full-thickness wounds were made on the dorsal skin of 3-week-old mice. After scab detachment (SD), the number, width, length, space and volume of neogenic hair follicles were analyzed using CSLM. The results were compared with those from conventional methods, including staining for alkaline phosphatase (AP) and keratin 17 (K17) as well as histology. RESULTS: Quantification of neogenic hair follicles using CSLM compared favorably with the results from direct measurements on isolated epidermal tissue after immunostaining for K17, a marker for the epithelial portion of new hair follicles. CSLM detected 89% of K17-stained follicles. CSLM more accurately quantified the number of new follicles compared with AP staining, which detects the dermal portion of the new follicle. The width and length measurement from CSLM and histology were very close and correlated with each other. The minimum length of a neogenic hair follicle that could be detected by CSLM was 21 mum. The space between neogenic hair follicles was decreased in histological sections compared with CSLM. CONCLUSION: CSLM is an accurate and valuable method for counting and measuring neogenic hair follicles non-invasively. CSLM produces images similar to histology in mice. Measurements of microstructures using CSLM more accurately reflect actual sizes as this technique avoids fixation artifacts. In vivo visualization of developing follicles with CSLM allows the detection of serial changes in hair follicle formation, thus conserving the numbers of mice required for studies and improving the detection of temporal changes in developing hair follicles.",

The possibility of using tissue-engineered skin grafts for full-thickness wound repair is a promising approach. The primary goal of tissue-engineered skin grafts is to restore lost barrier function, but regeneration of appendages, such as hair follicles, has to be yet achieved.

However, many limitations still need to be explored, particularly enriching isolated cells with trichogenic capacity, maintaining this ability during processing, and providing the cells with proper environmental cues.

Despite its well-documented role as a cell cycle regulator and as a tumor suppressor, the function of 14-3-3sigma in the intricate balance of proliferation and differentiation in epithelial development is poorly understood. A mutation in 14-3-3sigma was found to be responsible for the repeated epilation (Er) phenotype. It has previously been shown that Sfn (+/Er) mice are characterized by repeated hair loss and regrowth, whereas Sfn (Er/Er) mice die at birth displaying severe oral fusions and limb abnormalities as a result of defects in keratinizing epithelia. Here we show that mice heterozygous for the 14-3-3sigma mutation have severe defects in hair shaft differentiation, resulting in destruction of the hair shaft during morphogenesis. Furthermore, we report that the interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous glands are hyperproliferative, coincident with expanded nuclear Yap1 (Yes-associated protein 1)--a critical modulator of epidermal stem cell proliferation. We also report that hair follicle stem cells in the bulge cycle abnormally, raising important questions as to the role of 14-3-3sigma in the bulge.",

The multistage model of nonmelanoma skin carcinogenesis has contributed significantly to our understanding of epithelial cancer in general. We used the Krt1-15CrePR1 ; R26R transgenic mouse to determine the contribution of keratin 15 + cells from the hair follicle to skin tumor development by following the labeled progeny of the keratin 15 expressing cells into papillomas. We present three novel observations. First, we found that keratin 15 expressing cells contribute to most of the papillomas by 20 weeks of promotion. Second, in contrast to the transient behavior of labeled keratin 15-derived progeny in skin wound healing, keratin 15 progeny persist in papillomas, and some malignancies for many months following transient induction of the reporter gene. Third, papillomas have surprising heterogeneity not only in their cellular composition, but also in their expression of the codon 61 signature Ha-ras mutation with approximately 30% of keratin 15-derived regions expressing the mutation. Together, these results demonstrate that keratin 15 expressing cells of the hair follicle contribute to cutaneous papillomas with long term persistence and a subset of which express the Ha-ras signature mutation characteristic of initiated cells.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the suppression of Wnt10b by siRNA could prevent the development of hair follicle in the cultured rat embryonic skin. METHODS: siRNA-Wnt10b was synthesized by chemosynthesis method. The dorsal skin of SD rat at embryos were cultured in DMEM in the presence of different percentage of interfering RNA targeting Wnt10b. Wnt10b/beta-catenin expression was analyzed by real-time PCR everyday and by Western blot on the third day. The cultured embryonic skin underwent paraffin embedding, section, HE staining on the third day, in which the number of de novo hair follicle was calculated and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Wnt10b gene in the cultured embryonic skin could be knocked down with the siRNA-based method. Beta-catenin mRNA was not greatly influenced by the downregulation of Wnt10b mRNA. The number of de novo hair follicle placode in cultured embryonic skin decreased, along with the downregulation of Wnt10b and beta-catenin proteins expression. CONCLUSIONS: The downregulation of Wnt10b mRNA and protein by siRNA reduces the number of de novo hair follicle placode in the cultured rat embryonic skin.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanisms of hair follicle regeneration by injection of follicular cells isolated from murine skin. METHODS: Epidermis was peeled off from the dermis of 3-5 d C57BL/6J mouse by 0. 2% Dispase digestion at 37 degrees C for 2 hours. Dermis was cut into small pieces and digested in 0. 2% collagenase at 37 degrees C for 30 minute with low speed stirring to isolate hair follicles from dermis. Hair follicles were collected through filtration, low-speed centrifugation and density gradient centrifugation. Collagenase and trypsin were added to digest hair follicles into dissociated cells which were marked by Dio and injected into the nude mouse skin. RESULTS: 2 d after intradermal injection of hair follicle cells, a cyst was formed containing lots of round and elliptical cells and homogeneous eosin stained cell-free tissues. The cyst wall was composed of many spindle shaped fibroblast cells and showed sparsely localized green fluorescence. The contents of the cyst showed bright green fluorescence. 4 d after injection, the skin became slightly thicken with grey appearance, a lots of hair follicles formed with black bulb. 1 weeks after injection, the injection site became black and evaluated with a lots of black hair follicles and hyperproliferation of capillary blood. Newly formed hair follicles showed bright green fluorescence. 3 weeks after injection, a cyst containing lots of black hairs formed in the injection site. Newly formed hair follicles showed positive for Dio. Sebaceous gland can be seen accompanied with hair follicles. 6 weeks after injection, the cyst contained lots of sheded club hair shafts and hair follicles on the stage of anagen. Cultured follicular cells and injection below 1 x 10 (5) failed to regenerate hairs. While the regenerated hair follicle was few when the hair follicle cells were injected subcutaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Follicular cells can aggregate spontaneously and develop synergistically into hair follicles with normal growth cycle after implantation. The regeneration depends on the interactions between follicular cells, as well as on the recipient sites and cell numbers.",

Retinoic acid (RA) is essential during embryogenesis and for tissue homeostasis, whereas excess RA is well known as a teratogen. In humans, excess RA is associated with hair loss. In the present study, we demonstrate that specific levels of RA, regulated by Cyp26b1, one of the RA-degrading enzymes, are required for hair follicle (hf) morphogenesis. Mice with embryonic ablation of Cyp26b1 (Cyp26b1 (-/-)) have excessive endogenous RA, resulting in arrest of hf growth at the hair germ stage. The altered hf development is rescued by grafting the mutant skin on immunodeficient mice. Our results show that normalization of RA levels is associated with reinitiation of hf development. Conditional deficiency of Cyp26b1 in the dermis (En1Cre ; Cyp26b1f/-) results in decreased hair follicle density and specific effect on hair type, indicating that RA levels also influence regulators of hair bending. Our results support the model of RA-dependent dermal signals regulating hf downgrowth and bending. To elucidate target gene pathways of RA, we performed microarray and RNA-Seq profiling of genes differentially expressed in Cyp26b1 (-/-) skin and En1Cre ; Cyp26b1f/-tissues. We show specific effects on the Wnt-catenin pathway and on members of the Runx, Fox, and Sox transcription factor families, indicating that RA modulates pathways and factors implicated in hf downgrowth and bending.

To gain insight into the functional role of Trps1, we analyzed the late morphogenesis vibrissae phenotype of Trps1 (Deltagt) mutant mice, which is characterized by follicle degeneration after peg downgrowth has been initiated. We found that Trps1 directly represses expression of the hair follicle stem cell regulator Sox9 to control proliferation of the follicle epithelium. Furthermore, we identified a copy number variation upstream of SOX9 in a family with hypertrichosis that significantly decreases expression of the gene in the hair follicle, providing new insights into the long-range regulation of SOX9.

Prostaglandins (PGs) are key inflammatory mediators involved in wound healing and regulating hair growth ; however, their role in skin regeneration after injury is unknown. Using wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN) as a marker of skin regeneration, we hypothesized that PGD2 decreases follicle neogenesis. PGE2 and PGD2 were elevated early and late, respectively, during wound healing. The levels of WIHN, lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds), and its product PGD2 each varied significantly among background strains of mice after wounding, and all correlated such that the highest Ptgds and PGD2 levels were associated with the lowest amount of regeneration. In addition, an alternatively spliced transcript variant of Ptgds missing exon 3 correlated with high regeneration in mice. Exogenous application of PGD2 decreased WIHN in wild-type mice, and PGD2 receptor Gpr44-null mice showed increased WIHN compared with strain-matched control mice. Furthermore, Gpr44-null mice were resistant to PGD2-induced inhibition of follicle neogenesis. In all, these findings demonstrate that PGD2 inhibits hair follicle regeneration through the Gpr44 receptor and imply that inhibition of PGD2 production or Gpr44 signaling will promote skin regeneration.",

BACKGROUND: Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) in older equids is commonly recognized by a long hair coat that fails to shed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare hair follicle stages in PPID-affected horses with excessively long hair coats with the stages of normal aged horses (controls) and to compare hair follicle stages in PPID-affected horses after 6 months of treatment with pergolide mesylate with those of control horses. ANIMALS: Eight PPID-affected horses and four normal, age-matched, control horses. METHODS: Skin biopsies were collected from the neck and rump of PPID-affected and control horses. A diagnosis of PPID was established based on hair coat changes and supportive overnight dexamethasone suppression test results. Skin biopsies were repeated after 6 months of treatment with pergolide. The number of hair follicles in anagen (A) or telogen (T) was counted for each skin biopsy using transverse sections. RESULTS: Pretreatment biopsies had a greater percentage of A follicles (neck 96%, rump 95%) and a lower percentage of T follicles (neck 4%, rump 5%) in PPID-affected horses than in control horses (A, neck 15%, rump 25% ; and T, neck 85%, rump 75%). After treatment with pergolide, all PPID-affected horses had improved shedding, and the percentages of A follicles (neck 69%, rump 70%) and T follicles (neck 31%, rump 30%) were not different from untreated control horses (A, neck 68%, rump 82% ; and T, neck 32%, rump 18%). CONCLUSIONS: These findings document that excessive hair growth (hypertrichosis) in PPID-affected horses is due to persistence of hair follicles in A.

Ablation of TFAM in keratinocytes impaired epidermal differentiation and hair follicle growth and resulted in death 2 weeks after birth.

It has been termed onychodermis. The onychodermis expresses CD10 with remarkable specificity. Herein, we compare adult and fetal human hair follicles with fetal nail organs in an attempt to draw analogies for the mesenchyme associated with both adnexal structures. METHODS: We examined immunohistochemically samples from adult and fetal hair follicles for the expression of CD10, CD34 and the mesenchymal stem cell marker nestin and compared the antigen profile with that of the fetal nail organ. RESULTS: The CD10-positive/CD34-negative onychodermis is prominently visible at the end of the second trimester. A corresponding follicular structure was not identified, either in the adult or in the developing hair follicle. Nestin staining does not define the onychodermis. CONCLUSIONS: The concept of the onychodermis is equally valid in the developing nail organ where it is also defined by its expression for CD10.

The growing fibers had growth cones on their tips expressing F-actin. These findings indicate that beta-III tubulin-positive fibers elongating from the whisker follicle sensory nerve stump were growing axons. The growing whisker sensory nerve was highly enriched in ND-GFP cells which appeared to play a major role in its elongation and interaction with other nerves in 3D culture, including the sciatic nerve, the trigeminal nerve, and the trigeminal nerve ganglion.

Moreover, this non-random segregation would protect the stem cell genome from accumulating multiple mutations during repeated DNA replication.

In cell culture analysis of paired cultured keratinocytes derived from hair follicle, stem cells suggested a non-random segregation of chromosome with respect to the older DNA strand. In vivo, the hair follicle stem cells appear to self-renew and differentiate at different phases of their homeostatic cycle. The fate decisions occur in quiescence when some stem cells migrate out of their niche and commit to differentiation without self-renewal.

Understanding molecular mechanisms for regeneration of hair follicles provides new opportunities for developing treatments for hair loss and other skin disorders. Here we show that fibroblast growth factor 9 (Fgf9), initially secreted by gammadelta T cells, modulates hair follicle regeneration after wounding the skin of adult mice. Reducing Fgf9 expression decreases this wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN). Conversely, overexpression of Fgf9 results in a two-to threefold increase in the number of neogenic hair follicles. We found that Fgf9 from gammadelta T cells triggers Wnt expression and subsequent Wnt activation in wound fibroblasts. Through a unique feedback mechanism, activated fibroblasts then express Fgf9, thus amplifying Wnt activity throughout the wound dermis during a crucial phase of skin regeneration. Notably, humans lack a robust population of resident dermal gammadelta T cells, potentially explaining their inability to regenerate hair after wounding. These findings highlight the essential relationship between the immune system and tissue regeneration.

The scalp strips or follicular unit extracts were harvested from occipital, posterior auricular, dog-eared scalp, adjacent scalp area, and nuchal area. The recipient sites were scalp, eyebrow, lip, and eyelid. RESULTS: The follow-up cases over 6 months after operation were 18 among total 25 cases. The result after hair follicle transplantation was excellent (44. 4%), good (38. 9%), fair (11. 1%), and poor (5. 6%). CONCLUSIONS: The hair follicle transplantation on the scar tissue is more difficult than grafting on normal tissue because the scar is accompanied by poor blood circulation and stiffness of tissue. The patients with burned scar achieved more favorable result than did others. Incision scars are deeper than burned scars, and their success rates are poor. We should recommend the patients that hair follicle transplantation on the scar may need secondary or more operations for the aesthetically better result.",

    "text": "Architectural niche organization by LHX2 is linked to hair follicle stem cell function. In adult skin, self-renewing, undifferentiated hair follicle stem cells (HF-SCs) reside within a specialized niche, where they spend prolonged times as a single layer of polarized, quiescent epithelial cells. When sufficient activating signals accumulate, HF-SCs become mobilized to fuel tissue regeneration and hair growth. Here, we show that architectural organization of the HF-SC niche by transcription factor LHX2 plays a critical role in HF-SC behavior. Using genome-wide chromatin and transcriptional profiling of HF-SCs in vivo, we show that LHX2 directly transactivates genes that orchestrate cytoskeletal dynamics and adhesion. Conditional ablation of LHX2 results in gross cellular disorganization and HF-SC polarization within the niche. LHX2 loss leads to a failure to maintain HF-SC quiescence and hair anchoring, as well as progressive transformation of the niche into a sebaceous gland. These findings suggest that niche organization underlies the requirement for LHX2 in hair follicle structure and function.",

    "text": "CCN2 modulates hair follicle cycling in mice. It is critical to understand how stem cell activity is regulated during regeneration. Hair follicles constitute an important model for organ regeneration because, throughout adult life, they undergo cyclical regeneration. Hair follicle stem cells-epithelial cells located in the follicle bulge-are activated by periodic beta-catenin activity, which is regulated not only by epithelial-derived Wnt, but also, through as-yet-undefined mechanisms, the surrounding dermal microenvironment. The matricellular protein connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) is secreted into the microenvironment and acts as a multifunctional signaling modifier. In adult skin, CCN2 is largely absent but is unexpectedly restricted to the dermal papillae and outer root sheath. Deletion of CCN2 in dermal papillae and the outer root sheath results in a shortened telogen-phase length and elevated number of hair follicles. Recombinant CCN2 causes decreased beta-catenin stability in keratinocytes. In vivo, loss of CCN2 results in elevated numbers of K15-positive epidermal stem cells that possess elevated beta-catenin levels and beta-catenin-dependent reporter gene expression. These results indicate that CCN2 expression by dermal papillae cells is a physiologically relevant suppressor of hair follicle formation by destabilization of beta-catenin and suggest that CCN2 normally acts to maintain stem cell quiescence.",

Here, we explore why hair growth wanes with age. We show that aged hair follicle SCs (HFSCs) in mice exhibit enhanced resting and abbreviated growth phases and are delayed in response to tissue-regenerating cues. Aged HFSCs are poor at initiating proliferation and show diminished self-renewing capacity upon extensive use. Only modestly restored by parabiosis, these features are rooted in elevated cell-intrinsic sensitivity and local elevation in bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling. Transcriptional profiling presents differences consistent with defects in aged HFSC activation. Notably, BMP-/calcium-regulated, nuclear factor of activated T-cell c1 (NFATc1) in HFSCs becomes recalcitrant to its normal down-regulating cues, and NFATc1 ChIP-sequencing analyses reveal a marked enrichment of NFATc1 target genes within the age-related signature. Moreover, aged HFSCs display more youthful levels of hair regeneration when BMP and/or NFATc1 are inhibited. These results provide unique insights into how skin SCs age.",

However, in absence of pathogenic diagnosis and causality criteria, chances are low that a treatment given by the whims of fate will adequately control hair effluvium. The risk and frequency of therapeutic inertia are further increased. When the hair loss is not controlled and/or compensated by growth of new hairs, several clinical aspects of alopecia inexorably develop.

The presence of white hair within vitiligo lesions is considered a bad prognostic sign since these lesions are difficult to repigment. Melanocyte reservoir was not extensively studied in vitiliginous white hair. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate pigment cell reservoir in vitiliginous black and white hair. METHOD: Using immunohistochemical technique, skin biopsies from 30 vitiligo patients (including either black or white hair) and 10 age-and gender-matched healthy subjects were examined. Human Melanoma Black-45 (HMB-45) was used for detecting active melanocytes and Tyrosinase Related Protein 2 (TRP2) for detecting the whole melanocyte lineage including melanocyte stem cells (MelSC). RESULTS: About 61. 1% of black hair was positive for HMB-45 and 83. 3% was positive for TRP2. About 25% of white hair was positive for HMB-45 and 75% retained TRP2 positivity. Follicular HMB-45 expression and TRP2 expression percentage were significantly lower in white than black hair (P = 0. 05, 0. 04 respectively). Epidermal HMB-45 and TRP2 expression percentages were significantly higher in lesions containing black rather than white hair (P < 0. 001, P = 0. 05 respectively). Black hair was significantly associated with histologically pigmented hair follicles (P = 0. 049), and with residual interfollicular melanin pigment (P = 0. 007). CONCLUSION: Melanocytes, either active (melanotic) or inactive (amelanotic which may include MelSC), are not totally absent from vitiliginous white hair. However, intact melanocyte reservoir was observed more in black than white hair. This may add avenues for future research about the possibility of white vitiliginous hair to repigment.",

INTRODUCTION: Stem cells from hair follicle have great therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine as sources of cells for transplantation. The differentiation pathway selected by hair follicle stem cells (HFSC) is largely determined by local microenvironmental signals. In this study, human hair follicle stem cells were treated with Notch signaling blocker to explore a new approach to modulate human hair follicle stem cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro. AIM: To define the functional consequences of blocking the Notch signaling pathway on the proliferation and differentiation of human HSCs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The human hair follicle stem cells were treated with various concentrations of Notch signaling blocker DAPT (24-diamino-5-phenylthiazole). The viability of the cells was investigated with clonogenicity assays. The expression of stem cell markers, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were analysed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Notch blocking leads to promotion of human hair follicle stem cell proliferation and inhibition of differentiation in response to DAPT. The maximum effect of DAPT on the viability of human HFSC was observed at a concentration of 20 microM. We found that DAPT treatment results in downregulation of Hes1 and p21 and upregulation of Wnt10b. CONCLUSIONS: gamma-Secretase inhibitor DAPT has a modulatory effect on the human HFSC.

Skin development is governed by complex programs of gene activation and silencing, including microRNA-dependent modulation of gene expression. Here, we show that miR-214 regulates skin morphogenesis and hair follicle (HF) cycling by targeting beta-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. miR-214 exhibits differential expression patterns in the skin epithelium, and its inducible overexpression in keratinocytes inhibited proliferation, which resulted in formation of fewer HFs with decreased hair bulb size and thinner hair production. The inhibitory effects of miR-214 on HF development and cycling were associated with altered activities of multiple signaling pathways, including decreased expression of key Wnt signaling mediators beta-catenin and Lef-1, and were rescued by treatment with pharmacological Wnt activators. Finally, we identify beta-catenin as one of the conserved miR-214 targets in keratinocytes. These data provide an important foundation for further analyses of miR-214 as a key regulator of Wnt pathway activity and stem cell functions during normal tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and aging.",

The human hair follicle (HF) exhibits peripheral clock activity, with knock-down of clock genes (BMAL1 and PER1) prolonging active hair growth (anagen) and increasing pigmentation. Similarly, thyroid hormones prolong anagen and stimulate pigmentation in cultured human HFs. In addition they are recognized as key regulators of the central clock that controls circadian rhythmicity. Therefore, we asked whether thyroxine (T4) also influences peripheral clock activity in the human HF. Over 24 hours we found a significant reduction in protein levels of BMAL1 and PER1, with their transcript levels also decreasing significantly. Furthermore, while all clock genes maintained their rhythmicity in both the control and T4 treated HFs, there was a significant reduction in the amplitude of BMAL1 and PER1 in T4 (100 nM) treated HFs. Accompanying this, cell-cycle progression marker Cyclin D1 was also assessed appearing to show an induced circadian rhythmicity by T4 however, this was not significant. Contrary to short term cultures, after 6 days, transcript and/or protein levels of all core clock genes (BMAL1, PER1, clock, CRY1, CRY2) were up-regulated in T4 treated HFs. BMAL1 and PER1 mRNA was also up-regulated in the HF bulge, the location of HF epithelial stem cells. Together this provides the first direct evidence that T4 modulates the expression of the peripheral molecular clock. Thus, patients with thyroid dysfunction may also show a disordered peripheral clock, which raises the possibility that short term, pulsatile treatment with T4 might permit one to modulate circadian activity in peripheral tissues as a target to treat clock-related disease.",

BACKGROUND: During hair transplantation as an effective therapy for androgenetic alopecia, hair follicles were typically trans-located from the nonaffected occipital to the balding frontal or vertex region of the scalp. Although this is an autologous intervention, the donor and recipient hair follicle tissue differ in composition and local environment. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: In two case studies, we investigated the changes in hair follicle morphology and the immune status of scalp and body hair follicles from different origins transplanted to the eyebrows and the frontal scalp using follicular unit extraction. RESULTS: Quantitative histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry revealed a transformation in hair follicle length and dermal papilla size of the scalp, chest and beard hair follicles, which had been re-extracted after a 6-month period posttransplantation. Furthermore, a significant infiltration of B and T lymphocytes as well as macrophages could be observed most prominently in the infundibulum of transplanted hair follicles. CONCLUSION: The presented results demonstrate that hair follicle units from different body sites are capable to replace miniaturized or degraded hair follicles in different recipient areas like scalp or eyebrows as they keep their intrinsic capability or acquire the potential to readjust plastically within the beneficiary skin region. The essential secretory crosstalk underlying the observed tissue remodeling is possibly mediated by the infiltrating immune cells.",

BACKGROUND AIMS: Little is published on the characterization and therapeutic potential of human mesenchymal cells derived from hair follicle (HF) dermal sheath (DS). In this study, we isolated and characterized HF DS-mesenchymal stromal cells (DS-MSCs) with respect to the bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs). We further tested if DS-MSC-conditioned medium (CM), like what was previously reported for BM-MSC CM, has superior wound-healing properties, in both in vitro and in vivo wound models compared with skin fibroblast CM. METHODS: DS-MSCs were isolated from HF and cultured in vitro to assess long-term growth potential, colony-forming efficiency (CFE), expression of CD surface markers and differentiation potential. The cytokine expression of DS-MSC CM was determined through an antibody-based protein array analysis. The wound-healing effects of the CM were tested in vitro with the use of human cell cultures and in vivo with the use of a diabetic mouse wound model. RESULTS: In vitro results revealed that DS-MSCs have high growth capacity and CFE while displaying some phenotypes similar to BM-MSCs. DS-MSCs strongly expressed many surface markers expressed in BM-MSCs and could also differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes. DS-MSCs secreted significantly higher proportions of paracrine factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and growth-related oncogene. DS-MSC-CM demonstrated enhanced wound-healing effects on human skin keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in vitro, and the wound-healing time in diabetic mice was found to be shorter, compared with vehicle controls. CONCLUSIONS: Human HF DS stromal cells demonstrated MSC-like properties and might be an alternative source for therapeutic use in wound healing.",

In this study, we investigated a new treatment for autoimmune diabetes using naturally immune privileged, hair follicle derived, autologous cells to provide localized immune protection of islet allotransplants. Islets from Balb/c mouse donors were cotransplanted with syngeneic hair follicle dermal sheath cup cells (DSCC, group 1) or fibroblasts (FB, group 2) under the kidney capsule of immune-competent, streptozotocin induced, diabetic C57BL/6 recipients. Group 1 allografts survived significantly longer than group 2 (32. 2 +-12. 2 versus 14. 1 +-3. 3 days, P < 0. 001) without administration of any systemic immunosuppressive agents. DSCC reduced T cell activation in the renal lymph node, prevented graft infiltrates, modulated inflammatory chemokine and cytokine profiles, and preserved better beta cell function in the islet allografts, but no systemic immunosuppression was observed. In summary, DSCC prolong islet allograft survival without systemic immunosuppression by local modulation of alloimmune responses, enhancing of beta cell survival, and promoting of graft revascularization. This novel finding demonstrates the capacity of easily accessible hair follicle cells to be used as local immunosuppression agents in islet transplantation.",

    "text": "Post-transcriptional Regulation of Keratinocyte Progenitor Cell Expansion, Differentiation and Hair Follicle Regression by miR-22. Hair follicles (HF) undergo precisely regulated recurrent cycles of growth, cessation, and rest. The transitions from anagen (growth), to catagen (regression), to telogen (rest) involve a physiological involution of the HF. This process is likely coordinated by a variety of mechanisms including apoptosis and loss of growth factor signaling. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying follicle involution after hair keratinocyte differentiation and hair shaft assembly remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that a highly conserved microRNA, miR-22 is markedly upregulated during catagen and peaks in telogen. Using gain-and loss-of-function approaches in vivo, we find that miR-22 overexpression leads to hair loss by promoting anagen-to-catagen transition of the HF, and that deletion of miR-22 delays entry to catagen and accelerates the transition from telogen to anagen. Ectopic activation of miR-22 results in hair loss due to the repression a hair keratinocyte differentiation program and keratinocyte progenitor expansion, as well as promotion of apoptosis. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that miR-22 directly represses numerous transcription factors upstream of phenotypic keratin genes, including Dlx3, Foxn1, and Hoxc13. We conclude that miR-22 is a critical post-transcriptional regulator of the hair cycle and may represent a novel target for therapeutic modulation of hair growth.",

To examine the role of this complex in the epidermis, we generated mutant mice harboring epidermal-specific deletion of aPKClambda (conditional knock-out (cKO)), a major component of the aPKC-PAR complex. The mutant mice exhibited abnormal hair follicle (HF) cycling, progressive losses of pelage hairs and vibrissae, and altered differentiation into the epidermis and sebaceous gland. We found that in the aPKClambda cKO mice HF stem cell (HFSC) quiescence was lost, as revealed by the decreased expression level of quiescence-inducing factors (Fgf18 and Bmp6) produced in Keratin 6-positive bulge stem cells. The loss of quiescence dysregulated the HFSC marker expression and led to the increase in Lrig1-positive cells, inducing hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous glands, and drove an increase in Lef1-positive matrix cells, causing a prolonged anagen-like phase. Persistent bulge stem cell activation led to a gradual depletion of CD34-and alpha6 integrin-positive HFSC reservoirs.

The expression of liver-specific gene was detected by immunofluorescence and Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. Periodic Acid-Schiff stain, Indocyanine Green stain and Low-Density Lipoprotein stain were performed to evaluate the functions of induced hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). HF-MSCs were unable to differentiate into HLCs using previously reported procedures for MSCs from other tissues. However, HF-iPS efficiently induced the generation of HLCs that expressed hepatocyte markers and drug metabolism-related genes. HF-iPS can be used as novel and alternative cellular tools for inducing hepatocytes in vitro, simultaneously benefiting from utilizing HF-MSCs as a noninvasive and convenient cell source for reprogramming.",

Agriculture in the United States employs youth ages ten and older in work environments with high pesticide levels. Younger children in rural areas may also be affected by indirect pesticide exposures. The long-term effects of pesticides on health and development are difficult to assess and poorly understood. Yet, epidemiologic studies suggest associations with cancer as well as cognitive deficits. We report a practical and cost-effective approach to assess environmental pesticide exposures and their biological consequences in children. Our approach combines silicone wristband personal samplers and DNA damage quantification from hair follicles, and was tested as part of a community-based participatory research (CBPR) project involving ten Latino children from farmworker households in North Carolina. Our study documents high acceptance among Latino children and their caregivers of these noninvasive sampling methods. The personal samplers detected organophosphates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids in the majority of the participants (70%, 90%, 80%, respectively). Pesticides were detected in all participant samplers, with an average of 6. 2 +-2. 4 detections/participant sampler. DNA damage in epithelial cells from the sheath and bulb of plucked hairs follicles was quantified by immunostaining 53BP1-labled DNA repair foci. This method is sensitive, as shown by dose response analyses to gamma radiations where the lowest dose tested (0. 1Gy) led to significant increased 53BP1 foci density. Immunolabeling of DNA repair foci has significant advantages over the comet assay in that specific regions of the follicles can be analyzed. In this cohort of child participants, significant association was found between the number of pesticide detections and DNA damage in the papilla region of the hairs. We anticipate that this monitoring approach of bioavailable pesticides and genotoxicity will enhance our knowledge of the biological effects of pesticides to guide education programs and safety policies.",

The present study demonstrated that hair follicle stem cells (HFSc) have multidirectional differentiation potential and participate in skin wound healing processes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as non-protein coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides, which are important in the proliferation and differentiation of cells. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of PlncRNA-1 in the proliferation and differentiation of HFSc. Results revealed that PlncRNA-1, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, Wnt and beta-catenin expression levels were significantly downregulated in HFSc. PlncRNA-1 transfection promoted proliferation and differentiation of HFSc. TGF-beta1, Wnt and beta-catenin expression levels were upregulated in HFSc following transfection of PlncRNA-1. Results demonstrated that TGF-beta1 inhibitor LY2109761 blocked proliferation and differentiation of HFSc promoted by PlncRNA-1 transfection. In addition, TGF-beta1 inhibitor LY2109761 led to decreased Wnt and beta-catenin expression levels in HFSc. Furthermore, PlncRNA-1 transfection stimulated the cell cycle of HFSc, whereas TGF-beta1 inhibitor LY2109761 inhibited the cell cycle of HFSc and decreased the acceleration of the cell cycle induced by PlncRNA-1 transfection.

OBJECTIVE: Primary blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an injury experienced during modern warfare due to exposure to the pressure waves produced by the detonation of explosives. With virtually no apparent physical damage or symptoms presented, there is a need for more objective and accessible mTBI biomarkers posing minimal invasiveness risk. METHODS: We measured the transcriptomic sensitivity of the hair follicles in relation to the severity of primary blast-derived TBI. An Advanced Blast Simulator system was used to expose male rats to single pulse shock waves (intensities ranging from 15 to 30 psi) in a head-only fashion. Gene differential expression (DE) and gene set (GS) analyses were conducted in the rat whisker hair follicles and the whole blood samples. RESULTS: While shared cellular function, themes were found across the exposure groups, some gene sets under such themes were unique to the exposure conditions. Intensity-specific pathway enrichment patterns within shared GS themes were also identified. Furthermore, while exhibited shared pathways, the blood transcriptome showed substantially fewer enriched gene sets compared with the hair follicles across all exposure conditions.

Using the ablation of epidermal caspase-8 as a model of wound healing in Mus musculus, we analyzed the signaling components responsible for epithelial stem cell proliferation. We found that IL-1alpha and IL-7 secreted from keratinocytes work in tandem to expand the activated population of resident epidermal gammadeltaT-cells. A downstream effect of activated gammadeltaT-cells is the preferential proliferation of hair follicle stem cells. By contrast, IL-1alpha-dependent stimulation of dermal fibroblasts optimally stimulates epidermal stem cell proliferation. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the regulation and function of epidermal cell-immune cell interactions and into how components that are classically associated with inflammation can differentially influence distinct stem cell niches within a tissue.",

In the present study this fragment was shortened to obtain peptides of 18, 20 and 29 amino acids in length, and their promoting effects on the healing of full-thickness skin wounds were assessed. Peptides were delivered periodically by topical application to punch wounds of mice. The wound healing speed was evaluated by measuring the reduction of wound areas at 4 and 7 days after injury. Histological analysis with Masson ' s trichrome staining was used to confirm epithelialization and dermal collagen deposition. Proliferation of epithelial basal cells was documented by 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine incorporation. Hair follicle stem cells were identified by immunostaining for leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 6. The results indicated that the 20-and 29-amino-acid short peptides significantly reduced the time required for wound healing compared to the vehicle. Histological analysis confirmed faster epithelial cell coverage of open wounds. Treatment with the PEDF peptide fragments also contributed to granulation, tissue formation by increasing the fibroblast population and enhancing collagen deposition in the dermis. Wounds treated with PEDF peptide fragments contained more basal cells proliferated in the epithelium. Moreover, hair follicle stem cells were also stimulated to proliferate by peptide exposure.

BACKGROUND: Eccrine sweat glands (ESGs) are critical for thermoregulation and are involved in wound healing. ESGs have traditionally been considered as separate skin appendages without connection to the pilosebaceous unit (PSU). However, recent preliminary evidence has encouraged the hypothesis that the PSU and ESG are more interconnected than previously thought. OBJECTIVES: To re-evaluate the morphology of human skin adnexa with an integrated three-dimensional (3D) perspective in order to explore the possible interconnections that the PSU and the ESG may form. METHODS: A systematic 3D reconstruction method of skin sections, direct visualization of human scalp follicular unit transplant grafts and a scalp strip ex vivo were used to validate and further explore the hypothesis. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the coiled portion of most ESGs is morphologically integrated into the PSU of human scalp skin and forms a structural unit that is embedded into a specific, hair follicle-associated region of dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT). This newly recognized unit is easily accessible and experimentally tractable by organ culture of follicular units and can be visualized intravitally. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model of functional human skin anatomy in which ESGs are closely associated with the PSU and the dWAT to form a common homeostatic tissue environment, which may best be encapsulated in the term ' adnexal skin unit '. The challenge now is to dissect how each component of this superstructure of human skin functionally cooperates with and influences the other under physiological conditions, during regeneration and repair and in selected skin diseases.",

    "text": "Involvement of the central hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in hair growth and melanogenesis among different mouse strains. Stress has been demonstrated to play an important role in hair follicle function and the pathogenesis of some hair disorders. The central hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is activated by stress stimuli, synthesizes and releases various components and eventually induces the pathogenesis and recurrence of peripheral diseases. Our aim is to compare the different responses under exposure of stress in hair follicle function among different mouse strains, and to detect the involvement of the central HPA axis after stress in hair follicle growth and melanogenesis. In this study, we exposed different mouse strains (C57BL/6, CBA/J, C3H/HeN, BALB/c and ICR) to a 21-day chronic restraint stress protocol and selected C57BL/6, CBA/J and BALB/c mice for further study because of their significant behavioral alterations. Then, we evaluated and compared the different responses and sensitivity to chronic restraint stress in hair follicle function and central HPA axis among the selected strains. The results showed that expression of POMC, CRF and GR mRNA and protein and serum levels of corticosterone were inhibited in response to stress. These findings suggested that chronic restraint stress may inhibit hair follicle growth and melanogenesis via regulating the key elements of the central HPA axis. In addition, the results revealed different mouse strains exhibit different responses in the central HPA axis and hair follicle after stress exposure. C57BL/6 might be the most sensitive strain among the three strains tested as well as an appropriate strain to study possible pathophysiological mechanisms by which the nervous system influences skin function and screen dermatological drugs suitable for psychotherapy. We believe the current study will provide some useful information for researchers who are interested in the bidirectional communication between the nervous and skin systems and the management of stress-induced cutaneous diseases.",

OBJECTIVES: Although the effect of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on human skin has been extensively studied, very little is known on how UVR impacts on hair follicle (HF) homeostasis. Here, we investigated how solar spectrum UVR that hits the human skin surface impacts on HF biology, and whether any detrimental effects can be mitigated by a widely used cosmetic and nutraceutical ingredient, caffeine. METHODS: Human scalp skin with terminal HFs was irradiated transepidermally ex vivo using either 10 J/cm2 UVA (340-440 nm) + 20 mJ/cm2 UVB (290-320 nm) (low dose) or 50 J/cm2 UVA + 50 mJ/cm2 UVB (high dose) and organ-cultured under serum-free conditions for 1 or 3 days. 0. 1% caffeine (5. 15 mmol/L) was topically applied for 3 days prior to UV exposure with 40 J/cm2 UVA + 40 mJ/cm2 UVB and for 3 days after UVR. The effects on various toxicity and vitality read-out parameters were measured in defined skin and HF compartments. RESULTS: Consistent with previous results, transepidermal UVR exerted skin cytotoxicity and epidermal damage. Treatment with high and/or low UVA + UVB doses also induced oxidative DNA damage and cytotoxicity in human HFs. In addition, it decreased proliferation and promoted apoptosis of HF outer root sheath (ORS) and hair matrix (HM) keratinocytes, stimulated catagen development, differentially regulated the expression of HF growth factors, and induced perifollicular mast cell degranulation. UVR-mediated HF damage was more severe after irradiation with high UVR dose and reached also proximal HF compartments. The topical application of 0. 1% caffeine did not induce skin or HF cytotoxicity and stimulated the expression of IGF-1 in the proximal HF ORS. However, it promoted keratinocyte apoptosis in selected HF compartments. Moreover, caffeine provided protection towards UVR-mediated HF cytotoxicity and dystrophy, keratinocyte apoptosis, and tendential up-regulation of the catagen-promoting growth factor. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights the clinical relevance of our scalp UV irradiation ex vivo assay and provides the first evidence that transepidermal UV radiation negatively affects important human HF functions. This suggests that it is a sensible prophylactic strategy to integrate agents such as caffeine that can act as HF photoprotectants into sun-protective cosmeceutical and nutraceutical formulations.",

    "text": "The balance of Bmp6 and Wnt10b regulates the telogen-anagen transition of hair follicles. BACKGROUND: The periodic growth of hair follicles is regulated by the balance of activators and inhibitors. The BMP signaling pathway plays an important role during hair follicle regeneration, but the exact BMP protein that controls this process has not been revealed. METHODS: The expression of BMP6 was determined via in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. The in vivo effect of BMP6 overexpression was studied by using a previously established adenovirus injection model. The hair follicle regeneration was assessed by gross observation, H & E staining and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) tracing. The expression patterns of BMP6 signaling and Wnt10b signaling in both AdBMP6-treated and AdWnt10b-treated skins were determined by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. RESULTS: BMP6 was expressed differently in the stages of hair follicle cycle. The telogen-anagen transition of hair follicles was inhibited by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of BMP6. In the in vivo model, the BMP6 signaling was inhibited by Wnt10b and the Wnt10b signaling was inhibited by BMP6. The activation of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) was also competitively regulated by Wnt10b and BMP6. CONCLUSIONS: Combined with previously reported data of Wnt10b, our findings indicate that BMP6 and Wnt10b are major inhibitors and activators respectively and their balance regulates the telogen-anagen transition of hair follicles. To the best of our knowledge, our data provide previously unreported insights into the regulation of hair follicle cycling and provide new clues for the diagnosis and therapies of hair loss.",

However, how shift work affects the circadian expression of clock genes remains to be explored. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pattern of clock gene expression in shift workers in the field. METHODS: We examined clock gene expression in Japanese men who work: (1) one night shift followed by a day off (caregivers: nurses and doctors ; the one-night group) ; (2) three or more consecutive night shifts (factory workers ; the consecutive-night group) ; or (3) daytime only (the daytime group), using beard follicle samples. The expression of Period3, Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 (Nr1d1), and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 2 (Nr1d2) was examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Period3 expression in the daytime and one-night groups together with Nr1d2 expression in the one-night group fitted a 24-h-period cosine curve better than in the consecutive-night group (p = 0. 004, 0. 012, and 0. 001, respectively). The level of overall Period3 gene expression, calibrated with that of 18S-rRNA, was decreased in the consecutive-night group compared with that in the daytime group (p = 0. 006). The patterns of Period3 and Nr1d2 expression in the daytime and one-night groups were more coherent than those in the consecutive-night group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that night shift work affects the rhythms and levels of circadian Period3 and Nr1d2 expression dependent on the shift schedule or type of the shift ; however, there is substantial variation between individuals.",

In the present study, it was demonstrated that HF cells are able to be induced to differentiate into cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro under specific conditions. It was determined that HF cells cultured on OP9 feeder cells in KnockOut-Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium/B27 in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factors differentiated into cardiomyocyte-like cells that express markers specific to cardiac lineage, but do not express non-cardiac lineage markers including neural stem/progenitor cell, HF bulge cells or undifferentiated spermatogonia markers. These cardiomyocyte-like cells exhibited a spindle-and filament-shaped morphology similar to that presented by cardiac muscles and exhibited spontaneous beating that persisted for over 3 months. These results demonstrate that SC reprogramming and differentiation may be induced without resulting in any genetic modification, which is important for the clinical applications of SCs including tissue and organ regeneration.",

We show here that deletion of the Notch pathway co-factor RBP-J specifically in mouse HFSCs triggers adjacent McSCs to precociously differentiate in their shared niche. Transcriptome screen and in vivo functional studies revealed that the elevated level of retinoic acid (RA) caused by de-repression of RA metabolic process genes as a result of RBP-J deletion in HFSCs triggers ectopic McSCs differentiation in the niche. Mechanistically the increased level of RA sensitizes McSCs to differentiation signal KIT-ligand by increasing its c-Kit receptor protein level in vivo. Using genetic approach, we further pinpointed HFSCs as the source of KIT-ligand in the niche.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are receiving increasing attention for skin wound repair. However, the specific mechanisms underlying MSC-mediated improvement in wound healing have not been fully elucidated. This study aims at testing whether epidermal growth factor (EGF) can promote MSC-mediated wound healing and hair follicle regeneration. METHODS: Excisional wounds in rats were transplanted with different collagen-chitosan scaffolds: control, MSC, and MSC + EGF. Regenerated tissues were harvested 1, 3, or 5 weeks following transplantation, stained with hematoxylin and eosin and evaluated microscopically. The formation of sebaceous glands was examined by Oil red staining and the regeneration of hair follicles by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot to test the expression of hair follicle-specific factors. RESULTS: Gross observations showed that the wounds were much smaller and the hairs grew faster in the MSC + EGF group. Histological analysis demonstrated that there were more hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and newly formed blood vessels in the MSC + EGF group compared with that in the MSC group. In addition, oil red staining showed that MSCs + EGF induced sebaceous gland regeneration. Finally, immunohistochemistry and western blot revealed that MSCs + EGF increased the expression of hair follicle-specific factors. CONCLUSION: MSCs alone cannot achieve the regeneration of hair follicles and EGF can promote MSC-mediated wound healing and hair follicle regeneration.",

Inner Mongolian Cashmere goat is an excellent local breed selected for the dual-purpose of cashmere and meat. There are three lines of Inner Mongolian Cashmere goat: Erlangshan, Alashan and Aerbasi. Cashmere is a kind of precious textile raw material with a high price. Cashmere is derived from secondary hair follicle (SHF), while hair is derived from primary hair follicle (PHF). The growth cycle of SHF of cashmere goat is 1 year, and it can be divided into three different stages: anagen, catagen and telogen. In this study, we tried to find some important influence factors of SHF growth cycle in skin tissue from Inner Mongolian Cashmere goats by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Three female Aerbasi Inner Mongolian Cashmere goats (2 years old) were used as experimental samples in this study. Skin samples were collected in September (anagen), December (catagen) and March (telogen) at dorsal side from cashmere goats. Results showed that over 511 396 044 raw reads and 487 729 890 clean reads were obtained from sequence data. In total, 51 different expression genes (DEGs) including 29 downregulated genes and 22 upregulated genes were enriched in anagen-catagen comparing group. The 443 DEGs contained 117 downregulated genes and 326 upregulated genes that were enriched in catagen-telogen comparing group. In telogen-anagen comparing group, 779 DEGs were enriched including 582 downregulated genes and 197 upregulated genes. The result of gene ontology (GO) annotation showed that DEGs are in different growth cycle periods, and enriched GO items are mostly related to the transformation of cell and protein. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment result indicated that metabolic process has a great impact on SHF growth cycle. Based on the results of a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed genes, GO enrichment and KEGG enrichment, we found that FGF5, FGFR1 and RRAS had an effect on the hair follicle growth cycle.

HNG, a humanin analogue, activates cell growth, proliferation, and cell cycle progression, and it protects cells from apoptosis. This study was performed to investigate the promoting effect and action mechanisms of HNG on hair growth. HNG significantly increased DPC proliferation. HNG significantly increased hair shaft elongation in vibrissa hair follicle organ culture. In vivo experiment showed that HNG prolonged anagen duration and inhibited hair follicle cell apoptosis, indicating that HNG inhibited the transition from the anagen to catagen phase mice. Furthermore, HNG activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 1/2, Akt, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat3) within minutes and up-regulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels on DPCs.

    "text": "Hormonal Effects on Hair Follicles. The hair cycle and hair follicle structure are highly affected by various hormones. Androgens-such as testosterone (T) ; dihydrotestosterone (DHT) ; and their prohormones, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstendione (A)-are the key factors in terminal hair growth. They act on sex-specific areas of the body, converting small, straight, fair vellus hairs into larger darker terminal hairs. They bind to intracellular androgen receptors in the dermal papilla cells of the hair follicle. The majority of hair follicles also require the intracellular enzyme 5-alpha reductase to convert testosterone into DHT. Apart from androgens, the role of other hormones is also currently being researched-e. g., estradiol can significantly alter the hair follicle growth and cycle by binding to estrogen receptors and influencing aromatase activity, which is responsible for converting androgen into estrogen (E2). Progesterone, at the level of the hair follicle, decreases the conversion of testosterone into DHT. The influence of prolactin (PRL) on hair growth has also been intensively investigated, and PRL and PRL receptors were detected in human scalp skin. Our review includes results from many analyses and provides a comprehensive up-to-date understanding of the subject of the effects of hormonal changes on the hair follicle.",

The results indicated that EDA and EDAR were both expressed in the skin tissue in the seven cashmere goat embryo stages. Moreover, EDA and EDAR play an important role in the formation of embryonic placode (Pc). After interfering with EDA and EDAR, the expression of BMP2, BMP4, noggin, beta-catenin, TGF-beta 2, Wnt-10b, and NOTCH1 in fibroblasts and epithelial cells changed significantly.

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is important for maintaining cell phenotype and promoting cell proliferation and differentiation. In order to better solve the problem of skin appendage regeneration, a combination of mechanical/enzymatic digestion methods was used to self-extract dermal papilla cells (DPCs), which were seeded on silk fibroin/sodium alginate scaffolds as seed cells to evaluate the possibility of skin regeneration/regeneration of accessory organs. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) graphs showed that the interconnected pores inside the scaffold had a pore diameter in the range of 153-311 mum and a porosity of 41-82%. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining and cell morphological staining proved that the extracted cells were DPCs. The results of a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Calcein-AM/PI live-dead cell staining showed that the DPCs grew well in the composite scaffold extract. Normal cell morphology and characteristics of aggregation growth were maintained during the 3-day culture, which showed that the silk fibroin/sodium alginate (SF/SA) composite scaffold had good cell-compatibility. Hematoxylin-eosin (H & E) staining of tissue sections further proved that the cells adhered closely and aggregated to the pore wall of the scaffold, and retained the ability to induce differentiation of hair follicles. All these results indicate that, compared with a pure scaffold, the composite scaffold promotes the adhesion and growth of DPCs. We transplanted the SF/SA scaffolds into the back wounds of SD rats, and evaluated the damage model constructed in vivo. The results showed that the scaffold inoculated with DPCs could accelerate the repair of the skin and promote the regeneration of the hair follicle structure.",

    "text": "Rescuing key native traits in cultured dermal papilla cells for human hair regeneration. Introduction: The dermal papilla (DP) represents the major regulatory entity within the hair follicle (HF), inducing hair formation and growth through reciprocal interactions with epithelial cells. However, human DP cells rapidly lose their hair inductive ability when cultured in an epithelium-deficient environment. Objectives: To determine if the conditioned medium collected from interfollicular keratinocytes (KCs-CM) is capable of improving DP cell native properties and inductive phenotype. Methods: DP cells were cultured with KCs-CM both in 2D and 3D culture conditions (spheroids). Further, the hair-inductive capacity of DP cells precultured with KCs-CM was tested in a hair reconstitution assay, after co-grafting with human keratinocytes in nude mice. Results: We demonstrate that KCs-CM contributes to restore the inductivity of cultured human DP cells in a more effective mode than the conventional 3D-cultures. This is supported by the higher active alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in DP cells, the improved self-aggregative capacity and the reduced expression of alpha-SMA and the V1-isoform of versican. Moreover, DP cells cultured with KCs-CM displayed a secretome profile (VEGF, BMP2, TGF-beta1, IL-6) that matches the one observed during anagen. KCs-CM also enhanced DP cell proliferation, while preventing cells to undergo morphological changes characteristic of high passage cells. In opposition, the amount of collagenous and non-collagenous proteins deposited by DP cells was lower in the presence of KCs-CM. The improvement in ALP activity was maintained in 3D spheroidal cultures, even after KCs-CM retrieval, being superior to the effect of the gold-standard culture conditions. Moreover, DP cells cultured with KCs-CM and grafted with human keratinocytes supported the formation of HF-and sebaceous gland-like structures in mice. Conclusion: The proposed strategy encourages future cell-based strategies for HF regeneration not only in the context of hair-associated disorders, but also in the management of wounds to aid in restoring critical skin regulatory appendages.",

Current approaches for human hair follicle (HF) regeneration mostly adopt cell-autonomous tissue reassembly in a permissive murine intracorporeal environment. This, together with the limitation in human-derived trichogenic starting materials, potentially hinders the bioengineering of human HF structures, especially for the drug discovery and treatment of hair loss disorders. In this study, we attempted to reproduce the anatomical relationship between an epithelial main body and the dermal papilla (DP) within HF in vitro by three-dimensionally assembling columnarly molded human keratinocytes (KCs) and the aggregates of DP cells and evaluated how HF characteristics were reproduced in the constructs. The replaceability of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived DP substitutes was assessed using the aforementioned reconstruction assay. Human DP cell aggregates were embedded into Matrigel as a cluster. Subsequently, highly condensed human KCs were cylindrically injected onto DP spheroids. After 2-week culture, the structures visually mimicking HFs were obtained. KC-DP constructs partially reproduced HF microanatomy and demonstrated differential keratin (KRT) expression pattern in HFs: KRT14 in the outermost part and KRT13, KRT17, and KRT40, respectively, in the inner portion of the main body. KC-DP constructs tended to upregulate HF-related genes, KRT25, KRT33A, KRT82, WNT5A, and LEF1. Next, DP substitutes were prepared by exposing hiPSC-derived mesenchymal cells to retinoic acid and subsequently to WNT, BMP, and FGF signal activators, followed by cell aggregation. The resultant hiPSC-derived DP substitutes (iDPs) were combined with KCs in the invented assay. KC-iDP constructs morphologically resemble KC-DP constructs and analogously mimicked KRT expression pattern in HF. iDP in the constructs expressed DP-related markers, such as vimentin and versican. Intriguingly, KC-iDP constructs more intensely expressed KRT33A, KRT82, and LEF1, which were stepwisely upregulated by the addition of WNT ligand and the mixture of WNT, SHH, and EDA signaling activators, supporting the idea that iDP exhibited biological properties analogous to DP cell aggregates in the constructs in vitro. These preliminary findings suggested the possibility of regenerating DP equivalents with in vitro hair-inductive capacity using hiPSC-derived cell composites, which potentially reduce the necessity of human tissue-derived trichogenic cell subset and eventually allow xeno-free bioengineering of human HFs.",

Hair loss remains a challenging clinical problem that influences the quality of life. Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has become a valuable tool for fabricating tissue constructs for transplantation and other biomedical applications. Although some simple organs, such as skin and cartilage, have been successfully simulated, it remains challenging to make hair follicles (HFs), which are highly complex organs. The tissue engineering of human HFs has been a long-standing challenge, and progress with this has lagged behind that with other lab-grown tissues. This is principally due to a lack of availability of a platform that can successfully recapitulate the microenvironmental cues required to maintain the requisite cellular interactions for hair neogenesis. In this study, we used a 3D bioprinting technique based on a gelatin/alginate hydrogel to construct a multilayer composite scaffold with cuticular and corium layers to simulate the microenvironment of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) in the human body. This new approach permits the controllable formation of self-aggregating spheroids of DPCs in a physiologically relevant extracellular matrix and the initiation of epidermal-mesenchymal interactions, which results in HF formation in vivo. In conclusion, our 3D-bioprinted multilayer composite scaffold prepared using a gelatin/alginate hydrogel provides a suitable 3D microenvironment for DPCs to induce HF formation. The ability to regenerate entire HFs should have a significant impact on the medical management of hair loss. This method may also have critical applications for skin tissue engineering, with its appendages, for other purposes.",

After a retrospective medical record review at a single tertiary medical center, the hair color of 112 AA patients were identified and compared to a control group of 104 androgenetic alopecia patients. There were no statistically significant differences in the natural hair color prevalence between the 2 groups (p = 0. 164), and hair color was not a predictor of the alopecia type. Our results suggest hair pigmentation, determined by the eumelanin-to-pheomelanin ratio, is not a positive risk factor for AA development. We hope that our study will encourage multiple large-scale, collaborative, retrospective medical reviews to determine if our results are reproducible in diverse patient populations.",

    "text": "Emerging Role of Dermal White Adipose Tissue in Modulating Hair Follicle Development During Aging. Hair follicle stem cells are extensively reprogrammed by the aging process, manifesting as diminished self-renewal and delayed responsiveness to activating cues, orchestrated by both intrinsic microenvironmental and extrinsic macroenvironmental regulators. Dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT) is one of the peripheral tissues directly adjacent to hair follicles (HFs) and acts as a critical macroenvironmental niche of HF. dWAT directly contributes to HF aging by paracrine signal secretion. However, the altered interrelationship between dWAT and HF with aging has not been thoroughly understood. Here, through microdissection, we separated dWAT from the skin of aged mice (18 months) and young mice (2 months) in telogen and depilation-induced anagen for transcriptome comparing. Notably, compared with young dWAT, aberrant inflammatory regulators were recapitulated in aging dWAT in telogen, including substantial overexpressed inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases, and prostaglandin members. Nonetheless, with anagen initiation, inflammation programs were mostly abolished in aging dWAT, and instead of which, impaired collagen biosynthesis, angiogenesis, and melanin synthesis were identified. Furthermore, we confirmed the inhibitory effect on hair growth of CXCL1, one of the most significantly upregulated inflammation cytokines in aging dWAT. Besides this, we also identified the under-expressed genes related to Wnt signaling fibroblast growth factor family members and increased BMP signaling in aging dWAT, further unraveling the emerging role of dWAT in aging HFs malfunction. Finally, we proved that relieving inflammation of aging dWAT by injecting high-level veratric acid stimulated HF regenerative behavior in aged mice. Concomitantly, significantly decreased TNF-a, CCL2, IL-5, CSF2, and increased IL10 in dWAT was identified. Overall, the results elaborated on the complex physiological cycling changes of dWAT during aging, providing a basis for the potential regulatory effect of dWAT on aging HFs.",

BACKGROUND: Hair follicles have been reported to contribute to epidermal healing, with differentiation of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) aiding in wound re-epithelialization. This study is aimed to delineate the molecular mechanistic actions by which prostate cancer-upregulated long noncoding RNA 1 (PlncRNA-1) accelerates the proliferation and differentiation of HFSCs in wound healing. METHODS: HFSCs were obtained from the scalps of five volunteers, in which the expression of PlncRNA-1 and downstream regulatory genes was identified. Effects of PlncRNA-1 overexpression and ZEB1 knockdown on the proliferation and differentiation of HFSCs were examined. A wound mouse model was further established for in vivo experiments to substantiate in vitro findings. RESULTS: PlncRNA-1 is highly expressed in HFSCs and accelerates the proliferation and differentiation of HFSCs. PlncRNA-1 recruits EZH2 to ZEB1 promoter region and augments the H3K27me3 methylation, thereby downregulating the expression of ZEB1. Without such suppression, ZEB1 could repress MAPK1 expression and restrict HFSC proliferation and differentiation. Further, PlncRNA-1 overexpression accelerates wound healing and epidermal regeneration in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: PlncRNA-1 inhibits ZEB1 and activates MAPK1 signaling through upregulating EZH2, thereby enhancing the proliferation and differentiation of HFSCs and wound healing.",

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have unique immunomodulatory capacities. We investigated hair follicle-derived MSCs (HF-MSCs) from the dermal sheath, which are advantageous as an alternative source because of their relatively painless and minimally risky extraction procedure. These cells expressed neural markers upon isolation and maintained stemness for a minimum of 10 passages. Furthermore, HF-MSCs showed responsiveness to pro-inflammatory environments by expressing type-II major histocompatibility complex antigens (MHC)-II to a lesser extent than adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs). HF-MSCs effectively inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells equivalently to AT-MSCs. Additionally, HF-MSCs promoted the induction of CD4 + CD25 + FOXP3 + regulatory T cells to the same extent as AT-MSCs. Finally, HF-MSCs, more so than AT-MSCs, skewed M0 and M1 macrophages towards M2 phenotypes, with upregulation of typical M2 markers CD163 and CD206 and downregulation of M1 markers such as CD64, CD86, and MHC-II.

Background: Androgen alopecia (AGA), the most common type of alopecia worldwide, has become an important medical and social issue. Accumulating evidence indicates that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the progression of various human diseases, including AGA. However, the potential roles of lncRNAs in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and their subsequent relevance for AGA have not been fully elucidated. The current study aimed to explore the function and molecular mechanism of the lncRNA AC010789. 1 in AGA progression. Methods: We investigated the expression levels of AC010789. 1 in AGA scalp tissues compared with that in normal tissues and explored the underlying mechanisms using bioinformatics. HFSCs were then isolated from hair follicles of patients with AGA, and an AC010789. 1-overexpressing HFSC line was produced and verified. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were performed to verify the molecular mechanisms involved. Results: AC010789. 1 overexpression promoted the proliferation and differentiation of HFSCs. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that AC010789. 1 overexpression promotes the biological function of HFSCs by downregulating miR-21-5p and TGF-beta1 expression but upregulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Conclusion: These results reveal that overexpression of AC010789. 1 suppresses AGA progression via downregulation of hsa-miR-21-5p and TGF-beta1 and promotion of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, highlighting a potentially promising strategy for AGA treatment.",

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have stable structures, being a covalently closed loop without 5 ' and 3 ' free ends. They can function as \" \" miRNA sponges \" \" in regulating the expression of their target genes. It was thought that circRNAs are involved in the development of the secondary hair follicle (SHF) in cashmere goats. In our previous investigation, a new circRNA named circRNA-0100 was identified from the SHF of cashmere goats, but its function is unknown. In this work, we found that circRNA-0100 exhibited significantly higher expression at anagen SHF bulge than its counterpart at telogen in cashmere goats. Based on the use of both overexpression and siRNA interference assays, our data indicated that circRNA-0100 promoted the differentiation of cashmere goat SHF stem cells (SHF-SCs) into hair follicle lineage, which was evaluated by analyzing the transcriptional level changes of six indicator genes in SHF-SCs of cashmere goats. Using the RNA pull-down technique, we showed that circRNA-0100 served as \" \" molecular sponges \" \" of miR-153-3p in SHF-SCs. Through the use of dual-luciferase reporter assays, our data indicated that circRNA-0100 positively regulated the transcriptional expression of the KLF5 gene via the miR-153-3p-mediated pathway. Ultimately, we showed that circRNA-0100 promoted the differentiation of SHF-SCs into hair lineage, which might be achieved via sequestering miR-153-3p to heighten the KLF5 expression in SHF-SCs of cashmere goats. Our results provide novel scientific evidence for revealing the potential molecular regulatory mechanisms on the differentiation of SHF-SCs into hair lineage in cashmere goats. \"",

The whisker follicles from mice were used to explore the staining protocols, and the final protocol for the evaluation of human hair follicles was derived from animal experiments. After extraction, human hair follicles or mouse whisker follicles were permeabilized with 0. 3% Triton X-100. Subsequently, hair follicles were processed by either hematoxylin or alkaline phosphatase staining. The integrity and growth state, including the status of hair follicle stem cells and blood vessels of the extracted hair follicles, were clearly identified under a light microscope. Unhealthy hair follicles from donors or hair follicles broken during extraction were easily revealed by this method.

These data reveal the lineage trajectory of hsHF in unprecedented detail and uncover its multiple unexpected features not found in mouse HFs, including the presence of an innerbulge like compartment in the growing phase, lack of a discrete companion layer, and enrichment of EMT features in HF stem cells (HFSCs). Moreover, we demonstrate that besides melanocyte depletion, early-stage human hair graying is also associated with specific depletion of matrix hair progenitors but not HFSCs.

Introduction: Camphor is a popular compound for therapeutic and cosmetic use with a distinctive odour, and somatosensory warming and cooling properties. The mechanisms for its action remain unclear. Objective: The current study examined the effects of two enantiomers of camphor and related monoterpenoid compounds on mechanoreceptors. Methods: Extracellular recordings were made in an in vitro bath preparation. Camphor, borneol, eugenol, carveol, and thymol were tested on the neural activity of St I and St II slowly adapting mechanoreceptors in the rat vibrissal hair follicle preparation. Results: All compounds tested (0. 5-2 mM bath concentrations) resulted in dose-dependent depression of spontaneous and mechanically evoked firing (dynamic and static phases). The mean latency of responses also increased. Both St I and St II were similarly affected, although (-)-camphor had a greater depressant effect on St II than on St I units. Differences were found across the different compounds for their effect on the dynamic and static phases. Thymol was found to have the greatest depressant effect on these phases. The broad spectrum TRP blocker ruthenium red did not reverse the depressant effects of camphor. The depressant effects of the compounds appeared similar to those obtained using the local anaesthetic lignocaine. The depressant effects of camphor and of lignocaine were partially reversed by the K + channel blocker tetraethylammonium. Conclusions: The results question whether the depressant effects of camphor and related compounds act through TRP channels. Perhaps the use of more selective blockers may reveal the molecular mechanisms through which these compounds act.",

    "text": "KGF and EGF signalling block hair follicle induction and promote interfollicular epidermal fate in developing mouse skin. A key initial event in hair follicle morphogenesis is the localised thickening of the skin epithelium to form a placode, partitioning future hair follicle epithelium from interfollicular epidermis. Although many developmental signalling pathways are implicated in follicle morphogenesis, the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, also known as FGF7) receptors are not defined. EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands have previously been shown to inhibit developing hair follicles ; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been characterised. Here we show that receptors for EGF and KGF undergo marked downregulation in hair follicle placodes from multiple body sites, whereas the expression of endogenous ligands persist throughout hair follicle initiation. Using embryonic skin organ culture, we show that when skin from the sites of primary pelage and whisker follicle development is exposed to increased levels of two ectopic EGFR ligands (HBEGF and amphiregulin) and the FGFR2 (IIIb) receptor ligand KGF, follicle formation is inhibited in a time-and dose-dependent manner. We then used downstream molecular markers and microarray profiling to provide evidence that, in response to KGF and EGF signalling, epidermal differentiation is promoted at the expense of hair follicle fate. We propose that hair follicle initiation in placodes requires downregulation of the two pathways in question, both of which are crucial for the ongoing development of the interfollicular epidermis.

The dermal sheath (DS) of the hair follicle is comprised by fibroblast-like cells and extends along the follicular epithelium, from the bulb up to the infundibulum. From this structure, cells with stem characteristics were isolated: they have a mesenchymal origin and express CD90 protein, a typical marker of mesenchymal stem cells. It is not yet really clear in which region of hair follicle these cells are located but some experimental evidence suggests that dermal stem cells are localized prevalently in the lower part of the anagen hair follicle. As there are no data available regarding DS stem cells in dog species, we carried out a morphological analysis of the hair follicle DS and performed both an immunohistochemical and an immunocytochemical investigation to identify CD90 + cells. We immunohistochemically evidenced a clear and abundant positivity to CD90 protein in the DS cells located in the lower part of anagen hair follicle. The positive cells showed a typical fibroblast-like morphology. They were flat and elongated and inserted among bundles of collagen fibres. The whole structure formed a close and continuous sleeve around the anagen hair follicle. Our immunocytochemical study allowed us to localize CD90 protein at the cytoplasmic membrane level.",

BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) network is essential for proper development and homeostasis of skin and hair. However, detailed dissection of the role of the EGFR in hair follicle development and cycling have been impaired by the early mortality of EGFR knockout mice. OBJECTIVES: We have studied in Waved-5 mice carrying an antimorphic EGFR allele (Egfr (wa5)), whose product acts as a dominant-negative receptor, whether strongly reduced EGFR signaling impacts on the hair and skin phenotype. METHODS: Histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry were employed to study hair follicle morphogenesis stages and cycle induction in Waved-5 mice and control littermates during embryonic development and postnatal life. RESULTS: By routine histology and quantitative histomorphometry, no significant abnormalities in the epidermis and in hair follicle morphogenesis were detected, while the initiation of hair follicle cycling was slightly, but significantly retarded. Proliferation and apoptosis of epidermal and hair matrix keratinocytes of Waved-5 mice appeared unaltered. Intriguingly, the thickness of the subcutis and the percentage of proliferating subcutaneous adipocytes were significantly reduced in Waved-5 mice around days P8. 5 to P10. 5. Although no differences in total body weight gain could be detected, Wa5 mice showed a significant reduction in the percentage of body fat at P8. 5. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the presence of effective compensatory mechanisms in murine skin in vivo that ensure nearly normal epidermal and hair follicle keratinocyte function despite very low levels of EGFR-mediated signaling. Our unexpected findings of transiently reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue indicate a role for the EGFR in regulating subcutaneous fat.",

In adult hair follicles, Lgr6 + cells resided in a previously uncharacterized region directly above the follicle bulge. They expressed none of the known bulge stem cell markers. Prenatal Lgr6 + cells established the hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and interfollicular epidermis.

Wnt signalling is required for hair follicle development and for the growth phase (anagen) of postnatal follicles. When the pathway is activated at high levels in adult mouse epidermis, ectopic follicles form from existing follicles, interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and sebaceous glands, revealing a remarkable ability of the tissue to be reprogrammed. To compare the competence of different epidermal cell populations to form ectopic follicles, we expressed a 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT) inducible, stabilised beta-catenin transgene (DeltaNbeta-cateninER) under the control of two different promoters. We targeted the reservoir of stem cells in the hair follicle bulge via the keratin 15 (K15) promoter and targeted the sebaceous glands and base of the follicle (bulb) with a truncated K5 promoter (DeltaK5). No ectopic follicles formed in the IFE in either model, establishing the autonomy of the IFE stem cell compartment in undamaged epidermis. Activation of beta-catenin in the bulge stimulated proliferation and bulge expansion. Existing hair follicles entered anagen, but no ectopic follicles formed. DeltaK5DeltaNbeta-cateninER expressing hair follicles also entered anagen on 4OHT treatment. In addition, a subpopulation of cells at the base of the sebaceous gland readily formed ectopic follicles, resulting in complete and reversible conversion of sebaceous glands into hair follicles. Combined activation of beta-catenin and the vitamin D receptor enhanced differentiation of sebaceous gland-derived hair follicles and stimulated ectopic follicle formation in the hair follicle bulb, but not in the bulge. Our results suggest that the bulge and sebaceous gland are, respectively, non-permissive and permissive niches for Wnt induced hair follicle differentiation.",

RESULTS: Here we use a human BCC model system and mouse mutants to re-evaluate the role of laminin-511 in epithelial invagination in the skin. Blocking laminin 511 and 332 in BCCs maintains primary cilia and Shh signalling, but prevents invagination. Similarly, in laminin-511 and dermal beta-1 integrin mutants, dermal papilla development and primary cilia formation are normal. Dermal beta-1 integrin mutants have normal hair follicle development.

The hair follicle transplantation carries the possibility of producing a more natural scalp because both the desired hair density and the natural direction of the hair can be reproduced using this procedure. Our study group consisted of 62 patients (41 males and 21 females) with a mean age of 26. 3 years. The median age of suffering a burn to the scalp was 3 years. The causes of burn resulting to scalp alopecia were flame (n = 28), scald (n = 18), contact (n = 7), and electrical (n = 9) injuries. The first reconstruction for all patients was the expanded flap coverage. Three patients used 2-stage expanded flaps. Five patients underwent hair follicle transplantation after they had undergone the expanded flap coverage.

Hair loss in these mice is similar to that seen in primary cicatricial, or scarring alopecias in which immune targeting of hair follicle stem cells has been proposed as a key factor resulting in permanent hair follicle destruction. In this study we examine the mechanism of hair loss in GsdmA3 (Dfl)/+ mice. Aberrant expression patterns of stem cell markers during the hair cycle, in addition to aberrant behavior of the melanocytes leading to ectopic pigmentation of the hair follicle and epidermis, indicated the stem cell niche was not maintained. An autoimmune mechanism was excluded by crossing the mice with rag1-/-mice. However, large numbers of macrophages and increased expression of ICAM-1 were still present and may be involved either directly or indirectly in the hair loss. Reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry of sebaceous gland differentiation markers revealed reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), a potential cause of reduced sebum production, as well as the potential involvement of the innate immune system in the hair loss.

BACKGROUND: Traditional tissue-engineered skin does not produce a satisfactory long-term result because it lacks natural skin pigmentation and leads to discolored cosmetically unpleasing skin that only functions to cover the body of patients. Additionally, the cell sources for tissue-engineered skin are generally derived from normal skin, which is often limited in patients with skin defects. METHODS: In this study, hair follicle melanocytes and keratinocytes were isolated from human scalp. The melanocytes were co-cultured with keratinocytes until the second passage and then purified. Purified melanocytes and keratinocytes were seeded onto the chitosan-gelatin membrane for 1 week to construct pigmented tissue-engineered skin. The pigmented skin equivalent was used to resurface the skin defect in nude mice. Four weeks after grafting, skin biopsies were harvested to take hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry staining of Melan-A and HLA-ABC. RESULTS: Large quantities of purified melanocytes can be obtained with co-culture method. The hematoxylin and eosin staining of repaired skin biopsy demonstrated that the tissue-engineered skin can repair skin defects successfully. Engineered skin contained pigmentation and stained positive for Melan-A and HLA-ABC, which confirmed the presence of melanocytes and its sources were of human origin. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the possibility of constructing pigmented tissue-engineered skin with human hair follicle-derived keratinocytes and melanocytes, which brings a promising method to make up for the deficiency of traditional tissue-engineered skin and provides an alternative treatment for depigmentation diseases.",

In the current study, we investigated the expression pattern of the stem cell marker nestin in the hair follicle cycling of patients with alopecia areata. In the normal human scalp, the majority of hair follicles are in the anagen phase of development. While it is often difficult to identify nestin expression in late anagen phases, nestin-expressing cells are easily identified in proliferating cells located in the hfPSA of the growing early and middle anagen phase hair follicles. In patients exhibiting alopecia areata, the middle anagen hair follicles with growing cells were found to be nestin positive and K15 negative. In contrast, the hair follicles undergoing degradation in alopecia areata patients demonstrated lymphocytic infiltration within the nestin-and K15-negative dermal papilla cells. Both the nestin-positive hfPSA and K15-positive hair follicle bulge areas were not damaged in all phases.

We inactivated the Ilk gene in the keratin 15--expressing stem cell population of the mouse hair follicle bulge. Loss of ILK expression in these cells resulted in impaired cutaneous wound healing, with substantially decreased wound closure rates. ILK-deficient stem cells produced very few descendants that moved toward the epidermal surface and into the advancing epithelium that covers the wound. Furthermore, those few mutant cells that homed in the regenerated epidermis exhibited a reduced residence time. Paradoxically, ILK-deficient bulge stem cells responded to anagen growth signals and contributed to newly regenerated hair follicles during this phase of hair follicle growth. Thus ILK plays an important modulatory role in the normal contribution of hair follicle stem cell progeny to the regenerating epidermis following injury.",

Integrin alphavbeta6 is an epithelial-specific receptor that binds and activates latent transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). TGF-beta1 has been implicated as an endogenous inducer of hair follicle (HF) regression during hair cycling. We hypothesized that alphavbeta6 integrin-mediated TGF-beta1 signaling regulates hair regeneration and HF involution. In wild-type (WT) mice, the expression of integrin alphavbeta6 was strongly upregulated in the outer root sheath (ORS) during early hair regeneration, and was specifically enhanced in the HF bulge region. Expression gradually decreased in late anagen and remained restricted to the bulge region in the catagen and telogen stage HFs. The first spontaneous hair cycle was not altered in beta6 integrin knockout (beta6 (-/-)) mice. However, after depilation, beta6 (-/-) mice exhibited retarded HF regression compared with WT controls. beta6 (-/-) follicles contained significantly higher numbers of proliferating Ki67-positive keratinocytes than WT follicles at an identical cycle stage. The beta6 (-/-) follicles also demonstrated significantly reduced levels of TGF-beta1 expression and Smad2 phosphorylation during early anagen and anagen-catagen transition. Our study indicates that alphavbeta6 integrin has an important inhibitory role in keratinocyte proliferation in both HFs and interfollicular epidermis.

Intuitively, the process being considered as cyclic, an automaton controlling this cycle should be looked for, by analogy with a clock. However, the putative hair follicle oscillator that would control hair cycle failed to be identified and characterized. In fact, we have revealed that human hair follicle has an autonomous behaviour and that the transitions from one phase to the next occur independently for each follicle, after time intervals given stochastically by a lognormal distribution characterized by a mean and a variance. From this analysis, one can conclude that instead of a cyclical behaviour with an intrinsic automaton, a bistable steady state controls human hair follicle behaviour, which under a stochastic way jumps from the dormant to the active steady state and vice versa.",

    "text": "Modulatory role of sensory innervation on hair follicle stem cell progeny during wound healing of the rat skin. BACKGROUND: The bulge region of the hair follicle contains resident epithelial stem cells (SCs) that are activated and mobilized during hair growth and after epidermal wounding. However, little is known about the signals that modulate these processes. Clinical and experimental observations show that a reduced supply of sensory innervation is associated with delayed wound healing. Since axon terminals of sensory neurons are among the components of the bulge SC niche, we investigated whether these neurons are involved in the activation and mobilization of the hair stem cells during wound healing. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used neonatal capsaicin treatment to reduce sensory terminals in the rat skin and performed morphometric analyses using design-based stereological methods. Epithelial proliferation was analyzed by quantifying the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled (BrdU (+)) nuclei in the epidermis and hair follicles. After wounding, the epidermis of capsaicin-treated rats presented fewer BrdU (+) nuclei than in control rats. To assess SC progeny migration, we employed a double labeling protocol with iododeoxyuridine and chlorodeoxyuridine (IdU (+)/CldU (+)). The proportion of double-labeled cells was similar in the hair follicles of both groups at 32 h postwounding. IdU (+)/CldU (+) cell proportion increased in the epidermis of control rats and decreased in treated rats at 61 h postwounding. The epidermal volume immunostained for keratin 6 was greater in treated rats at 61 h. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor immunoreactivity were both present in CD34 (+) and BrdU-retaining cells of the hair follicles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that capsaicin denervation impairs SC progeny egress from the hair follicles, a circumstance associated with a greater epidermal activation. Altogether, these phenomena would explain the longer times for healing in denervated skin. Thus, sensory innervation may play a functional role in the modulation of hair SC physiology during wound healing.",

Previous research has revealed that Wnt10b activates canonical Wnt signaling, which is integral to melanocyte differentiation in hair follicles (HFs). However, the function of Wnt10b in HF melanocytes remains poorly understood. We determined using Dct-LacZ transgenic mice that Wnt10b is mainly expressed near and within melanocytes of the hair bulbs during the anagen stage of the hair cycle. We also found that Wnt10b promotes an increase in melanocyte maturation and pigmentation in the hair bulbs of the mouse HF. To further explore the potential functions of Wnt10b in mouse HF melanocytes, we infected iMC23 cells with Ad-Wnt10b to overexpress Wnt10b. We demonstrated that Wnt10b promotes the differentiation of melanocytes by activating canonical Wnt signaling in melanocytes.",

Hair follicle stem cells (bulge cells) are essential for hair regeneration and early epidermal repair after wounding. Here we show that Brg1, a key enzyme in the chromatin-remodeling machinery, is dynamically expressed in bulge cells to control tissue regeneration and repair. In mice, sonic hedgehog (Shh) signals Gli to activate Brg1 in bulge cells to begin hair regeneration, whereas Brg1 recruits NF-kappaB to activate Shh in matrix cells to sustain hair growth. Such reciprocal Brg1-Shh interaction is essential for hair regeneration. Moreover, Brg1 is indispensable for maintaining the bulge cell reservoir. Without Brg1, bulge cells are depleted over time, partly through the ectopic expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27 (Kip1). Also, bulge Brg1 is activated by skin injury to facilitate early epidermal repair. Our studies demonstrate a molecular circuit that integrates chromatin remodeling (Brg1), transcriptional regulation (NF-kappaB, Gli), and intercellular signaling (Shh) to control bulge stem cells during tissue regeneration.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on the proliferation of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) and hair follicle regeneration. METHODS: PRP was prepared using the double-spin method and applied to DPCs. The proliferative effect of activated PRP on DPCs was measured using MTT assay. To understand the influence of activated PRP on the hair-inductive capacity of DPCs, freshly isolated epidermal cells and DPCs of passage 4 were resuspended, mixed with various concentrations of a PRP (0%, 5% or 10%) and were then transferred to a grafting chamber, which was implanted onto the dorsal skin of nude mice. The chambers were removed 1 week after grafting and HF formation was monitored for 4 weeks ; the graft site was harvested and processed for histological examination. RESULTS: Activated PRP increased the proliferation benefited the aggregative growth of DPCs. There are significant difference in the yield of hair follicles compared with 10% PRP (344 +/-27) with 0% PRP (288 +/-35) in the area of reconstituted skin (P < 0. 05). The areas treated with PRP demonstrated an increase in hair follicles density of 19. 4%. Ten percent PRP (18 +/-1) d also can significantly shorten the time of hair formation, compared with 0% PRP (20 +/-1) d (P < 0. 05).

Hu sheep are considered a protected breed by the Chinese government. The hair follicles of these sheep have three types of waves, large, medium, and small. There are only few histological reports of Hu sheep lambskin, and there are no modern molecular or biological studies, so the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of hair follicles with different patterns are not currently known. The aim of this article was to study the molecular mechanism of the formation of these types of hair follicles in Hu sheep. Histological and microscopic analysis indicated that the number of follicles with small waves was not significantly higher than the number of follicles with large waves (P > 0. 05). The diameters of primary and secondary small-wave follicles were significantly smaller than those of large-wave follicles (P < 0. 05 ; P < 0. 01). The ratio between the number primary follicles and the number of secondary follicles was significantly higher among small-wave follicles than among large-wave follicles (P < 0. 05). Differentially expressed genes in the skin tissue were screened using an Agilent gene chip and RT-PCR. Differential expression analysis revealed 3 groups of large waves and small waves ; 1067, 2071, and 3879 differentially expressed genes ; and 137 genes common to all 3 groups. Differentially expressed genes were classified using gene ontology. They were found to be mainly involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, growth, immune response, and ion transport. RT-PCR results of 4 differentially expressed genes were consistent with gene chip results. Combined with related literature, our results suggest that BMP7, MMP2, SNAI1, SFXN1, CDKNIC, MT3, and POU1F1 may have important effects on the formation of large-wave and small-wave hair follicles. This study may enrich knowledge of hair follicle development, and may identify the genes responsible for the formation of hair follicles with different patterns.",

Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are important in vascular homeostasis and disease and thus, are critical elements in vascular tissue engineering. Although adult SMCs have been used as seed cells, such mature differentiated cells suffer from limited proliferation potential and cultural senescence, particularly when originating from older donors. By comparison, human hair follicle stem cells (hHFSCs) are a reliable source of stem cells with multi-differentiation potential. The aim of the present study, was to develop an efficient strategy to derive functional SMCs from hHFSCs. hHFSCs were obtained from scalp tissues of healthy adult patients undergoing cosmetic plastic surgery. The hHFSCs were expanded to passage 2 and induced by the administration of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) in combination with culture medium. Expression levels of SMC-related markers, including alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), alpha-calponin and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), were detected by immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). When exposed to differentiation medium, hHFSCs expressed early, mid and late markers (alpha-SMA, alpha-calponin and SM-MHC, respectively) that were similar to the markers expressed by human umbilical artery SMCs. Notably, when entrapped inside a collagen matrix lattice, these SM differentiated cells showed a contractile function. Therefore, the present study developed an efficient strategy for differentiating hHFSCs into contractile SMCs by stimulation with TGF-beta1 and PDGF-BB. The high yield of derivation suggests that this strategy facilitates the acquisition of the large numbers of cells that are required for blood vessel engineering and the study of vascular disease pathophysiology.",

    "text": "alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone: a protective peptide against chemotherapy-induced hair follicle damage ? BACKGROUND: Effective, safe and well-tolerated therapeutic and/or preventive regimens for chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) still remain to be developed. Because alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) exerts a number of cytoprotective effects and is well tolerated, we hypothesized that it may be a candidate CIA-protective agent. OBJECTIVES: To explore, using a human in vitro model for chemotherapy-induced hair follicle (HF) dystrophy that employs the key cyclophosphamide metabolite (4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, 4-HC), whether alpha-MSH protects from 4-HC-induced HF dystrophy. METHODS: Microdissected human scalp HFs from four individuals were treated with 4-HC, alpha-MSH and 4-HC plus alpha-MSH. Changes in HF cycling, melanin distribution and hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation/apoptosis were examined by quantitative (immune-) morphometry. Expression of the cytoprotective enzyme haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in HF of two individuals. RESULTS: In 50% of the individuals alpha-MSH reduced melanin clumping as an early sign of 4-HC-induced disruption of follicular pigmentation. alpha-MSH reduced 4-HC-induced apoptosis in the HFs of one female patient. These protective effects of alpha-MSH were not associated with changes in 4-HC-induced catagen induction. alpha-MSH and 4-HC both increased HO-1 mRNA expression, while the combination of both agents had additive effects on HO-1 transcription. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous alpha-MSH exerts moderate HF-protective effects against 4-HC-induced human scalp HF damage and upregulates the intrafollicular expression of a key cytoprotective enzyme. However, as substantial interindividual response variations were found, further studies are needed to probe alpha-MSH as a candidate CIA-protective agent.",

Here we study the formation of secondary hair follicle patterns in the skin of developing mouse embryos. We used the expression of sex-determining region Y box 2 to identify and distinguish the primary and secondary hair follicles and to infer the spatiotemporal dynamics of the follicle formation process. Quantitative analysis of the specific follicle patterns observed reveals a simple geometrical rule governing the formation of secondary follicles, and motivates an expansion-induction (EI) model in which new follicle formation is driven by the physical growth of the embryo. The EI model requires only one diffusible morphogen and provides quantitative, accurate predictions on the relative positions and timing of secondary follicle formation, using only the observed configuration of primary follicles as input. The same model accurately describes the positions of additional follicles that emerge from skin explants treated with an activator. Thus, the EI model provides a simple and robust mechanism for predicting secondary space-filling patterns in growing embryos.",

In these animals, HF disruption altered susceptibility to UVB-induced BCCs. Tumor onset in hairless mice was 10 weeks earlier than in haired littermates. The incidence of BCCs was significantly higher in hairless than in haired animals ; however, the magnitude of sonic hedgehog signaling did not differ significantly.

Stem cells offer tremendous opportunities for regenerative medicine. Over the past decade considerable research has taken place to identify and characterize the differentiation states of stem cells in culture. Raman micro-spectroscopy has emerged as an ideal technology since it is fast, nondestructive, and does not require potentially toxic dyes. Raman spectroscopy systems can also be incorporated into confocal microscope imaging systems allowing spectra to be obtained from below the tissue surface. Thus there is significant potential for monitoring stem cells in living tissue. Stem cells that reside in hair follicles are suitable for testing this possibility since they are close to the skin surface, and typically clustered around the bulge area. One of the first steps needed would be to obtain Raman micro-spectra from stem cells located in thin sections of tissue, and then see whether these spectra are clearly different from those of the surrounding differentiated cells. To facilitate this test, standard 5 mum thick sections of murine skin tissue were stained to identify the location of hair follicle stem cells and their progeny. Raman spectra were then obtained from adjacent cells in a subsequent unstained 10 mum thick section. The spectra revealed significant differences in peak intensities associated with nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and amino acids. Statistical analyses of the Raman micro-spectra identified stem cells with 98% sensitivity and 94% specificity, as compared with a CD34 immunostaining gold standard. Furthermore analyses of the spectral variance indicated differences in cellular dynamics between the two cell groups. This study shows that Raman micro-spectroscopy has a potential role in identifying adult follicle stem cells, laying the groundwork for future applications of hair follicle stem cells and other somatic stem cells in situ.",

Recently, role of stem cells localized in various epidermal compartments has been shown in the pathogenesis of skin cancer. To direct ODC expression in distinct epidermal compartments, we have developed keratin 6 (K6)-ODC/SKH-1 and keratin 14 (K14)-ODC/SKH-1 mice and employed them to investigate the role of ODC directed to these epidermal compartments on UVB-induced carcinogenesis. K6-driven ODC over-expression directed to outer root sheath (ORS) of hair follicle was more effective in augmenting tumorigenesis as compared to mice where K14-driven ODC expression was directed to inter-follicular epidermal keratinocytes. Chronically UVB-irradiated K6-ODC/SKH-1 developed 15 +-2. 5 tumors/mouse whereas K14-ODC/SKH-1 developed only 6. 8 +-1. 5 tumors/mouse. K6-ODC/SKH-1 showed augmented UVB-induced proliferation and much higher pro-inflammatory responses than K14-ODC/SKH-1 mice. Tumors induced in K6-ODC/SKH-1 were rapidly growing, invasive and ulcerative squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) showing decreased expression of epidermal polarity marker E-cadherin and enhanced mesenchymal marker, fibronectin. Interestingly, the number of CD34/CK15/p63 positive stem-like cells was significantly higher in chronically UVB-irradiated K6-ODC/SKH-1 as compared to K14-ODC/SKH-1 mice. Reduced Notch1 expression was correlated with the expansion of stem cell compartment in these animals. However, other signaling pathways such as DNA damage response or mTOR signaling pathways were not significantly different in tumors induced in these two murine models suggesting the specificity of Notch pathway in this regard. These data provide a novel role of ODC in augmenting tumorigenesis via negatively regulated Notch-mediated expansion of stem cell compartment.",

Tissue-engineered skin represents a useful strategy for the treatment of deep skin injuries and might contribute to the understanding of skin regeneration. The use of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) as a dermal component in a permanent composite skin with human hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) was evaluated by studying the tissue-engineered skin architecture, stem cell persistence, hair regeneration, and graft-take in nude mice. A porcine acellular dermal matrix was seeded with HFSCs alone and with HFSCs plus human DPCs or dermal fibroblasts (DFs). In vitro, the presence of DPCs induced a more regular and multilayered stratified epidermis with more basal p63-positive cells and invaginations. The DPC-containing constructs more accurately mimicked the skin architecture by properly stratifying the differentiating HFSCs and developing a well-ordered epithelia that contributed to more closely recapitulate an artificial human skin. This acellular dermal matrix previously repopulated in vitro with HFSCs and DFs or DPCs as the dermal component was grafted in nude mice. The presence of DPCs in the composite substitute not only favored early neovascularization, good assimilation and remodeling after grafting but also contributed to the neovascular network maturation, which might reduce the inflammation process, resulting in a better healing process, with less scarring and wound contraction. Interestingly, only DPC-containing constructs showed embryonic hair bud-like structures with cells of human origin, presence of precursor epithelial cells, and expression of a hair differentiation marker. Although preliminary, these findings have demonstrated the importance of the presence of DPCs for proper skin repair.",

Thus, as the infundibulum represents a major interface zone of mammalian skin epithelium with the environment and harbors a rich residential microflora, it is not surprising that this area is endowed with a specialized immune system and innate immune defenses. Clinically, the infundibulum is quite important, as it becomes prominently involved in many skin diseases such as acne, infundibular folliculitis and cysts, hidradenitis suppurativa, keratosis pilaris, Fox-Fordyce disease, and a subtype of basal cell carcinoma. Nevertheless, the biology of the infundibulum is only poorly understood, and it remains largely unknown how exactly the infundibulum contributes to skin disease, and how it might be targeted effectively for treating important skin diseases. Several recent studies in mouse models have identified new potential infundibular markers, shed light upon infundibular development and homeostasis, identified infundibular epithelial stem cells, and have implicated the infundibulum in the pathogenesis of additional skin disorders. These recent insights encourage one to systematically re-visit the biology and pathology of the infundibulum, one of the most important, yet least-studied frontiers in mammalian epithelial physiology.",

Here, we studied how epithelial energy metabolism impacts overall skin development by selectively deleting intraepithelial mtDNA in mice by ablating a key maintenance factor (Tfam (EKO)), which induces loss of function of the electron transport chain (ETC). Quantitative (immuno) histomorphometry demonstrated that Tfam (EKO) mice showed significantly reduced hair follicle (HF) density and morphogenesis, fewer intrafollicular keratin15 + epithelial progenitor cells, increased apoptosis, and reduced proliferation. Tfam (EKO) mice also displayed premature entry into (aborted) HF cycling by apoptosis-driven HF regression (catagen). Ultrastructurally, Tfam (EKO) mice exhibited severe HF dystrophy, pigmentary abnormalities, and telogen-like condensed dermal papillae. Epithelial HF progenitor cell differentiation (Plet1, Lrig1 Lef1, and beta-catenin), sebaceous gland development (adipophilin, Scd1, and oil red), and key mediators/markers of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during skin morphogenesis (NCAM, versican, and alkaline phosphatase) were all severely altered in Tfam (EKO) mice. Moreover, the number of mast cells, major histocompatibility complex class II +, or CD11b + immunocytes in the skin mesenchyme was increased, and essentially no subcutis developed. Therefore, in contrast to their epidermal counterparts, pilosebaceous unit stem cells depend on a functional ETC.

Both syndromes feature sparse hair heralding progressive macular dystrophy. EEM syndrome is characterized in addition by ectodermal and limb defects. Recent studies have demonstrated that, together with its involvement in cell-cell adhesion, P-cadherin plays a crucial role in regulating cell signaling, malignant transformation, and other major intercellular processes.

Here we show by intravital microscopy in live mice that the regression phase eliminates the majority of the epithelial cells by two distinct mechanisms: terminal differentiation of suprabasal cells and a spatial gradient of apoptosis of basal cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that basal epithelial cells collectively act as phagocytes to clear dying epithelial neighbours. Through cellular and genetic ablation we show that epithelial cell death is extrinsically induced through transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta activation and mesenchymal crosstalk. Strikingly, our data show that regression acts to reduce the stem cell pool, as inhibition of regression results in excess basal epithelial cells with regenerative abilities.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for wound healing, fibrosis, recurrence, and invasion of cancer. We sought to investigate the EMT in keloid and the mechanism through which the EMT regulates keloid formation. In keloid tissues, the expressions of EMT-associated markers and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1/Smad3 signaling were examined by immunohistochemistry. In the keloid epidermis and dermal tissue, the expressions of genes related to the regulation of skin homeostasis, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and p63, were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that accompanying the loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and the gain of the mesenchymal markers fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1) and vimentin in epithelial cells from epidermis and skin appendages, and in endothelial cells from dermal microvessels, enhanced TGF-beta1 expression and Smad3 phosphorylation were noted in keloid tissues. Moreover, alternative splicing of the FGFR2 gene switched the predominantly expressed isoform from FGFR2-IIIb to-IIIc, concomitant with the decreased expression of DeltaNp63 and TAp63, which changes might partially account for abnormal epidermis and appendages in keloids. In addition, we found that TGF-beta1-induced hair follicle outer root sheath keratinocytes (ORSKs) and normal skin epithelial cells underwent EMT in vitro with ORSKs exhibiting more obvious EMT changes and more similar expression profiles for EMT-associated and skin homeostasis-related genes as in keloid tissues, suggesting that ORSKs might play crucial roles in the EMT in keloids.

Here we address these dual pathomechanisms by examining the potency of a novel composition using in vitro assays of representative cell lines for AGA (hair follicle dermal papilla cells) and BPH (LNCaP prostate cells), respectively. Exposure of cells to the novel test composition down-regulated mRNA expression profiles characteristic of both disease processes, which outperformed finasteride.

    "text": "Vasoactive intestinal peptide, whose receptor-mediated signalling may be defective in alopecia areata, provides protection from hair follicle immune privilege collapse. BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disorder whose pathogenesis involves the collapse of the relative immune privilege (IP) of the hair follicle (HF). Given that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is an immunoinhibitory neuropeptide released by perifollicular sensory nerve fibres, which play a role in IP maintenance, it may modulate human HF-IP and thus be therapeutically relevant for AA. OBJECTIVES: To answer the following questions: Do human HFs express VIP receptors, and does their stimulation protect from or restore experimentally induced HF-IP collapse ? Is VIP signalling defective in AA HFs ? METHODS: Firstly, VIP and VIP receptor (VPAC1, VPAC2) expression in human scalp HFs and AA skin was assessed. In HF organ culture, we then explored whether VIP treatment can restore and/or protect from interferon-gamma-induced HF-IP collapse, assessing the expression of the key IP markers by quantitative (immuno-) histomorphometry. RESULTS: Here we provide the first evidence that VIP receptors are expressed in the epithelium of healthy human HFs at the gene and protein level. Furthermore, VIP receptor protein expression, but not VIP (+) nerve fibres, is significantly downregulated in lesional hair bulbs of patients with AA, suggesting defects in VIP receptor-mediated signalling. Moreover, we show that VIP protects the HF from experimentally induced IP collapse in vitro, but does not fully restore it once collapsed. CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data suggest that insufficient VIP receptor-mediated signalling may contribute to impairing HF-IP in patients with AA, and that VIP is a promising candidate ' HF-IP guardian ' that may be therapeutically exploited to inhibit the progression of AA lesions.",

Human hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells (hHFMSCs) are an important source of cardiovascular tissue engineering for their differentiation potential into smooth muscle cells (SMCs), yet the molecular pathways underlying such fate determination is unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in cell differentiation. In present study, we found that miR-128 was remarkably decreased during the differentiation of hHFMSCs into SMCs induced by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Moreover, overexpression of miR-128 led to decreased expression of SMC cellular marker proteins, such as smooth muscle actin (SMA) and calponin, in TGF-beta1-induced SMC differentiation. Further, we identified that miR-128 targeted the 3 '-UTR of SMAD2 transcript for translational inhibition of SMAD2 protein, and knockdown of SMAD2 abrogated the promotional effect of antagomir-128 (miR-128 neutralizer) on SMC differentiation. These results suggest that miR-128 regulates the differentiation of hHFMSCs into SMCs via targeting SMAD2, a main transcription regulator in TGF-beta signaling pathway involving SMC differentiation. The miR-128/SMAD2 axis could therefore be considered as a candidate target in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for SMCs.",

    "text": "Mitochondrial aerobic respiration is activated during hair follicle stem cell differentiation, and its dysfunction retards hair regeneration. Background. Emerging research revealed the essential role of mitochondria in regulating stem/progenitor cell differentiation of neural progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells and other stem cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS), Notch or other signaling pathway. Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis results in hair loss upon injury. However, alteration of mitochondrial morphology and metabolic function during hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) differentiation and how they affect hair regeneration has not been elaborated upon. Methods. We compared the difference in mitochondrial morphology and activity between telogen bulge cells and anagen matrix cells. Expression levels of mitochondrial ROS and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) were measured to evaluate redox balance. In addition, the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were estimated to present the change in energetic metabolism during differentiation. To explore the effect of the mitochondrial metabolism on regulating hair regeneration, hair growth was observed after application of a mitochondrial respiratory inhibitor upon hair plucking. Results. During HFSCs differentiation, mitochondria became elongated with more abundant organized cristae and showed higher activity in differentiated cells. SOD2 was enhanced for redox balance with relatively stable ROS levels in differentiated cells. PDK increased in HFSCs while differentiated cells showed enhanced PDH, indicating that respiration switched from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation during differentiation. Inhibiting mitochondrial respiration in differentiated hair follicle cells upon hair plucking repressed hair regeneration in vivo. Conclusions. Upon HFSCs differentiation, mitochondria are elongated with more abundant cristae and show higher activity, accompanying with activated aerobic respiration in differentiated cells for higher energy supply. Also, dysfunction of mitochondrial respiration delays hair regeneration upon injury.",

New hair follicles (HFs) do not form in adult mammalian skin unless epidermal Wnt signalling is activated genetically or within large wounds. To understand the postnatal loss of hair forming ability we monitored HF formation at small circular (2 mm) wound sites. At P2, new HFs formed in back skin, but HF formation was markedly decreased by P21. Neonatal tail also formed wound-associated HFs, albeit in smaller numbers. Postnatal loss of HF neogenesis did not correlate with wound closure rate but with a reduction in Lrig1-positive papillary fibroblasts in wounds. Comparative gene expression profiling of back and tail dermis at P1 and dorsal fibroblasts at P2 and P50 showed a correlation between loss of HF formation and decreased expression of genes associated with proliferation and Wnt/beta-catenin activity. Between P2 and P50, fibroblast density declined throughout the dermis and clones of fibroblasts became more dispersed. This correlated with a decline in fibroblasts expressing a TOPGFP reporter of Wnt activation. Surprisingly, between P2 and P50 there was no difference in fibroblast proliferation at the wound site but Wnt signalling was highly upregulated in healing dermis of P21 compared with P2 mice. Postnatal beta-catenin ablation in fibroblasts promoted HF regeneration in neonatal and adult mouse wounds, whereas beta-catenin activation reduced HF regeneration in neonatal wounds. Our data support a model whereby postnatal loss of hair forming ability in wounds reflects elevated dermal Wnt/beta-catenin activation in the wound bed, increasing the abundance of fibroblasts that are unable to induce HF formation.",

The Polycomb group proteins are transcriptional repressors that are critically important in the control of stem cell activity and maintenance of the identity of differentiated cells. Polycomb proteins interact with each other to form chromatin-associated repressive complexes (Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2) leading to chromatin compaction and gene silencing. However, the roles of the distinct components of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 in the control of skin development and keratinocyte differentiation remain obscure. Dauber et al. demonstrate the conditional ablations of three essential Polycomb repressive complex 2 subunits (EED, Suz12, or Ezh1/2) in the epidermal progenitors result in quite similar skin phenotypes including premature acquisition of a functional epidermal barrier, formation of ectopic Merkel cells, and defective postnatal hair follicle development. The reported data demonstrate that in skin epithelia, EED, Suz12, and Ezh1/2 function largely as subunits of the Polycomb repressive complex 2, which is important in the context of data demonstrating their independent activities in other cell types. The report provides an important platform for further analyses of the role of distinct Polycomb components in the control of gene expression programs in the disorders of epidermal differentiation, such as psoriasis and epidermal cancer.",

INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the extremely low frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) has attracted a great deal of scientific interest. The ELF-EMF signal is able to control ion transport across ion channels and therefore induce cell differentiation. AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ELF-EMF (50 Hz, 1 mT) on MAP2 and Nestin gene expression of dermal papilla mesenchymal cells (DPCs). METHODS: In order to examine the effect of chemical and electromagnetic factors on gene expression, 4 experimental groups, namely chemical (cell exposure to chemical signals), EMF (exposing cells to ELF-EMF), chemical-EMF (subjecting cells to chemical signals and ELF-EMF) and control (with no treatment) groups, were prepared, treated for 5 days, and studied. To assess the effect of extended test time on the expression of neural differentiation markers (Nestin and MAP2), an EMF group was prepared and treated for a period of 14 consecutive days. The beneficial role of EMF in inducing neural differentiation was shown by real-time PCR analysis. RESULTS: The higher expression of MAP2 after 14 days compared to that after 5 days and decrease of cell proliferation on days 5 to 20 were indicative of the positive effect of extending treatment time on neural differentiation by evaluation of gene expression in EMF group.",

Unbiased clustering of 1, 422 single-cell transcriptomes revealed 25 distinct populations of interfollicular and follicular epidermal cells. Our data allowed the reconstruction of gene expression programs during epidermal differentiation and along the proximal-distal axis of the hair follicle at unprecedented resolution. Moreover, transcriptional heterogeneity of the epidermis can essentially be explained along these two axes, and we show that heterogeneity in stem cell compartments generally reflects this model: stem cell populations are segregated by spatial signatures but share a common basal-epidermal gene module. This study provides an unbiased and systematic view of transcriptional organization of adult epidermis and highlights how cellular heterogeneity can be orchestrated in vivo to assure tissue homeostasis.",

In both culture conditions, DHT stimulation downregulated Wnt5a and Wnt10b mRNA while the Wnt antagonist Dkk-1 was upregulated.

A cluster of such genes was identified by an expression gene-array from the dorsal skin in a depilated mouse model, and CXCL4 was identified as a significantly regulated gene during the hair regeneration process. To elucidate the function of CXCL4 in hair growth, CXCL4 activity was blocked by the administration of an anti-CXCL4 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Histomorphometric analysis indicated that anti-CXCL4 mAb induced an earlier anagen phase and delayed hair follicle regression, in contrast with that in the control group. Moreover, CXCL4 mAb upregulated the transcription levels of several hair growth-related genes, including Lef1, Wnt10b, Bmp4 and Bmp2. In addition, CXCL4 mAb increased the levels of the proliferation-related protein PCNA and Bcl-2 during the anagen phase, while it reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved caspase-3 during the catagen phase.

Therefore, the current study has studied these characteristics of keratin 15 + (K15), CD200 + or CD34 + cells within anagen VI hHFs by immunohistomorphometry, using Ki-67 and 5-ethynyl-2 '-deoxyuridine (EdU).

Furthermore, we also show how prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which is upregulated in balding scalp, differentially impacts on the proliferation of distinct eHFSC populations. Namely, 24 h organ-cultured hHFs treated with PGD2 displayed reduced Ki-67 expression and EdU incorporation in bulge resident K15 + cells, but not in supra/proximal bulb outer root sheath K15 + progenitors.

The present study identified a SP in the mouse HF expressing the ABCG2 transporter and MTS24 surface marker. These cells are restricted to the upper isthmus of the HF and have previously been described as progenitor cells. Consistent with their SP characteristic, they demonstrated elevated expression of ABCG2 transporter, which participates in the dye efflux. Analysis of tumor epidermal cell lines revealed a correlation between the number of SP keratinocytes and the grade of malignancy, suggesting that the SP may play a role in malignant progression. Consistent with this idea, the present study observed an increased number of cells expressing ABCG2 and MTS24 in chemically induced skin tumors and skin tumor cell lines. This SP does not express the CD34 surface marker detected in the multipotent stem cells of the bulge region of the HF, which have been defined as tumor initiation cells. The present study concluded that a SP with properties of progenitor cells is localized in the upper isthmus of the HF and is important in mouse skin tumor progression.",

It is broadly accepted that psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with a heritable component, but it is not clear what causes inflammation in the skin. Previous research suggests that fragments of the keratin 17 (K17) protein, which are constitutively expressed in hair follicles, could act as autoantigens. In this study, we synthesized the K17 protein from mRNA derived from hair follicles and tested whether it elicited T cell responses depending on the patient genotype at the major susceptibility locus HLA-Cw * 06: 02. We treated peripheral blood-derived cells with the K17 protein and its short fragments to assess the T cell proliferation response using flow cytometry. Our analyses show a significantly stronger increase in cell proliferation among patients but not in healthy controls. We then examined whether the variation in T cell proliferation correlated with the patient HLA-Cw * 06: 02 risk genotype. Considering the affected status and patient genotype as two independent predictors, we fitted a linear model and showed that the HLA-Cw * 06: 02 allele dosage strongly predicted the T cell response. Our study findings suggest that the K17 protein likely acts as an autoantigen in psoriasis and that patients ' risk genotype is strongly correlated with the magnitude of the response to this putative autoantigen.",

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of photoperiod on nutrient digestibility, hair follicle (HF) activity and cashmere quality in Inner Mongolia white cashmere goats. METHODS: Twenty-four female (non-pregnant) Inner Mongolia white cashmere goats aged 1 to 1. 5 years old with similar live weights (mean, 20. 36 +-2. 63 kg) were randomly allocated into two groups: a natural daily photoperiod group (NDPP group: 10 to 16 h light, n = 12) and a short daily photoperiod group (SDPP group: 7 h light: 17 h dark, n = 12). All the goats were housed in individual pens and fed the same diets from May 15 to October 15, 2015. The digestibility of crude protein (CP), dry matter (DM), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) were measured in different months, along with secondary hair follicle (SHF) activity, concentration of melatonin (MEL), and cashmere quality. RESULTS: Although there was no significant difference in the live weights of goats between the SDPP and NDPP groups (p > 0. 05), the CP digestibility of goats in the SDPP group was significantly increased compared to the NDPP group in July, September, and October (p < 0. 05). For the DM and NDF digestibility of goats, a significant increase (p < 0. 05) was found during in September in the SDPP group. Furthermore, compared to the NDPP group, the SHF activity in July, the MEL concentration in July, and the cashmere fiber length and fiber weight in October were significantly increased in the SDPP group (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The cashmere production of Inner Mongolia white cashmere goats was increased without obvious deleterious effects on the cashmere fibers in the SDPP group (metabolizable energy, 8. 34 MJ/kg ; CP, 11. 16% ; short daily photoperiod, 7 h light: 17 h dark).",

Background: Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is considered a variant of lichen planopilaris affecting mainly the frontotemporal hairline. Since the first report in 1994, several other clinical features have been associated with the disease, such as facial papules (FP). Even though FP have been linked to facial vellus hair follicle involvement, how this finding alone could lead to the formation of clinically evident FP in FFA patients had not yet been addressed. Objective: To describe histopathological findings of FP in the context of FFA and to highlight features that may be linked to their clinical formation. Methods: Cutaneous FP biopsies of FFA patients performed between January 2016 and May 2017 were retrieved from our pathology database and reexamined by 2 pathologists. Results: Histological sections of thirteen 3. 0-mm punch biopsy specimens (2 horizontally and 11 vertically oriented) were collected from 7 patients. Eleven specimens demonstrated prominent sebaceous glands and 10 dilated sebaceous ducts. Pinkus acid orcein staining revealed reduction and fragmentation of the elastic fibers in 12 samples and, in 7 of these, this finding was observed in both the papillary and reticular dermis, particularly around sebaceous lobules. Vellus hair follicle involvement was only seen in 2 samples. Conclusions: Prominent sebaceous lobules with dilated ducts associated with an abnormal elastic framework seem to be the main explanation for the formation of FP in the context of FFA.",

Introduction: Regarding the limited ability of the damaged cartilage cells to self-renew, which is due to their specific tissue structure, subtle damages can usually cause diseases such as osteoarthritis. In this work, using laser photobiomodulation and an interesting source of growth factors cocktail called the synovial fluid, we analyzed the chondrogenic marker genes in treated hair follicle dermal papilla cells as an accessible source of cells with relatively high differentiation potential. Methods: Dermal papilla cells were isolated from rat whisker hair follicle (Rattus norvegicus) and established cell cultures were treated with a laser (gallium aluminum arsenide diode Laser (lambda = 780 nm, 30 mW) at 5 J/cm2), the synovial fluid, and a combination of both. After 1, 4, 7, and 14 days, the morphological changes were evaluated and the expression levels of four chondrocyte marker genes (Col2a1, Sox-9, Col10a1, and Runx-2) were assessed by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: It was monitored that treating cells with laser irradiation can accelerate the rate of proliferation of cells. The morphology of the cells treated with the synovial fluid altered considerably as in the fourth day they surprisingly looked like cultured articular chondrocytes. The gene expression analysis showed that all genes were up-regulated until the day 14 following the treatments although not equally in all the cell groups. Moreover, the cell groups treated with both irradiation and the synovial fluid had a significantly augmented expression in gene markers. Conclusion: Based on the gene expression levels and the morphological changes, we concluded that the synovial fluid can have the potential to make the dermal papilla cells to most likely mimic the chondrogenic and/or osteogenic differentiation, although this process seems to be augmented by the irradiation of the low-level laser.",

The seasonal circulation of yak hair helps them adapt to high altitude but the regulation mechanisms of the proliferation and differentiation of hair follicles (HFs) cells during development are still unknown. Here, using time series data for transcriptome and hormone contents, we systematically analyzed the mechanism regulating the periodic expression of hair development in the yak and reviewed how different combinations of genetic pathways regulate HFs development and cycling. RESULTS: This study used high-throughput RNA sequencing to provide a detailed description of global gene expression in 15 samples from five developmental time points during the yak hair cycle. According to clustering analysis, we found that these 15 samples could be significantly grouped into three phases, which represent different developmental periods in the hair cycle. A total of 2316 genes were identified in these three consecutive developmental periods and their expression patterns could be divided into 9 clusters. In the anagen, genes involved in activating hair follicle growth are highly expressed, such as the WNT pathway, FGF pathway, and some genes related to hair follicle differentiation. In the catagen, genes that inhibit differentiation and promote hair follicle cell apoptosis are highly expressed, such as BMP4, and Wise. In the telogen, genes that inhibit hair follicle activity are highly expressed, such as DKK1 and BMP1. Through co-expression analysis, we revealed a number of modular hub genes highly associated with hormones, such as SLF2, BOP1 and DPP8. They may play unique roles in hormonal regulation of events associated with the hair cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed the expression pattern and molecular mechanisms of the seasonal hair cycle in the yak. The findings will be valuable in further understanding the alpine adaptation mechanism in the yak, which is important in order to make full use of yak hair resources and promote the economic development of pastoral plateau areas.",

We investigated the number, morphology and pigmentation of hair follicles in anagen phases during the aging process. In addition, stem cells for keratinocytes and melanocytes were examined to evaluate the correlation between changes in skin characteristics and the stem cells. The remarkable changes caused by aging appeared to be the significant increase in qualitative phenotypes such as curved hair follicles and white hair. A significant difference between the number of keratinocyte and melanocyte stem cells in the hair bulge region is likely to be involved in these changes.

    "text": "A Photodynamic Tool to Promote a Sustained, ROS-Dependent Growth of Human Hair Follicles in Ex Vivo Culture. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may severely affect the biochemical viability of most cells. However, ROS may act also as key second messengers regulating important physiological functions in eukaryotic organisms. Of special interest is the potential role of ROS in the regulation of stem cell function and tissue homeostasis and regeneration in adult mammalian tissues. In this context, the hair follicle constitutes an excellent experimental model to study this aspect of ROS biology. Here we present a robust protocol to promote a sustained growth of ex vivo cultured human hair follicles based on the induction of a transient/modulable production of nonlethal endogenous ROS levels in the tissue through a protoporphyrin IX-dependent photodynamic procedure. The light-switchable ROS production activates hair follicle stem cell niches, induces cell proliferation, and maintains the growth/anagen phase for long time. This approach constitutes a complementary experimental tool to study the physiological roles of ROS in human tissues.",

Circular RNAs (CircRNAs) are a type of non-coding RNAs, which contain a covalently closed loop structure without 5 ' to 3 ' free ends. CircRNAs play essential roles in the regeneration of secondary hair follicle (SHF) and cashmere growth in goats. CircRNA-1926 was previously identified in SHF of cashmere goats, but its potential roles are unclear. In this study, we confirmed the expression of circRNA-1926 in SHF bulge of nine cashmere goats with a significantly higher level at anagen than that of telogen. Through the use of both overexpression and siRNA interference, we showed that circRNA-1926 promoted the differentiation of SHF stem cell into hair follicle lineage in cashmere goats which was evaluated via indictor genes Keratin 7 and Keratin 17. Using RNA pull-down, we found that circRNA-1926 bound with miR-148a/b-3p. Additionally, our data indicated that circRNA-1926 promoted the expression of the CDK19 gene. Using dual-luciferase reporter assays, it was revealed that circRNA-1926 positively regulated the CDK19 expression through miR-148a/b-3p. The results from this study demonstrated that circRNA-1926 contributes the differentiation of SHF stem cells into hair follicle lineages in cashmere goats via sponging miR-148a/b-3p to enhance CDK19 expression.",

BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is effective in the treatment of androgenetic alopecia (AGA). AIMS: The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of PRP on the proliferation of human follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs), to observe the effect of PRP on the growth of hair follicles and hair shaft in vitro, to measure growth factors, and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRP injection. PATIENTS/METHODS: The effect of PRP on the proliferation of HFDPCs was observed. The length of hair follicle and hair shaft in vitro was measured. Then, the concentration of growth factors (EGF, FGF-2, FGF-7, IGF-1, HGF, PDGF-BB, and VEGF-A) was evaluated. Half-head injection of PRP was conducted to 10 males. Three treatments were conducted at 30-day intervals. Digital photographs were taken ; hair diameter, hair density, unit density of hair follicles, and terminal hair/vellus hair were analyzed. RESULTS: Platelet-rich plasma significantly promoted the proliferation of HFDPCs. Under the PRP culture, the hair follicle and hair shaft were grown, and the hair growth length on the 3rd and 6th days was greater than that of the control. PRP contained growth factors such as EGF, FGF-2, FGF-7, IGF-1, HGF, PDGF-B, and VEGF-A. Hair diameter, hair density, and unit hair follicle density on the PRP injection side peaked in the 6th month. The terminal hair/vellus hair of the PRP injection side reached a peak in the 4th month. The average patient satisfaction during the entire treatment was 5. 4 points (0-10 points). CONCLUSION: Platelet-rich plasma can promote hair growth. PRP injection is safe and effective for the treatment of AGA.",

    "text": "Combining Deep Learning With Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging to Determine Scalp Hair and Follicle Counts. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: One of the challenges in developing effective hair loss therapies is the lack of reliable methods to monitor treatment response or alopecia progression. In this study, we propose the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and automated deep learning to non-invasively evaluate hair and follicle counts that may be used to monitor the success of hair growth therapy more accurately and efficiently. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 70 OCT scans from 14 patients with alopecia and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically count all follicles present in the scans. The model is based on a dual approach of both detecting hair follicles and estimating the local hair density in order to give accurate counts even for cases where two or more adjacent hairs are in close proximity to each other. RESULTS: We evaluate our system on 70 OCT manually labeled scans taken at different scalp locations from 14 patients, with 20 of those redundantly labeled by two human expert OCT operators. When comparing the individual human predictions and considering the exact locations of hair and follicle predictions, we find that the two human raters disagree with each other on approximately 22% of hairs and follicles. Overall, the deep learning (DL) system predicts the number of follicles with an error rate of 11. 8% and the number of hairs with an error rate of 18. 7% on average on the 70 scans. The OCT system can capture one scalp location in three seconds, and the DL model can make all predictions in less than a second after processing the scan, which takes half a minute using an unoptimized implementation. CONCLUSION: This approach is well-positioned to become the standard for non-invasive evaluation of hair growth treatment progress in patients, saving significant amounts of time and effort compared with manual evaluation.

Camellia japonica L. is a flowering tree with several medicinal and cosmetic applications. Here, we investigated the efficacy of C. japonica placenta extract (CJPE) as a potential therapeutic agent for promotion of hair growth and scalp health by using various in vitro and in vivo assays. Moreover, we performed transcriptome analysis to examine the relative expression of human follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPC) in response to CJPE by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). In vitro assays revealed upregulation of the expression of hair growth marker genes in HFDPC after CJPE treatment. Moreover, in vivo clinical tests with 42 adult female participants showed that a solution containing 0. 5% CJPE increased the moisture content of the scalp and decreased the scalp ' s sebum content, dead scalp keratin, and erythema. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis revealed key genes in HFDPC which are associated with CJPE. Interestingly, genes associated with lipid metabolism and cholesterol efflux were upregulated. Genes upregulated by CJPE are associated with several hormones, including parathyroid, adrenocorticotropic hormone, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), and norepinephrine, which are involved in hair follicle biology. Furthermore, some upregulated genes are associated with the regulation of axon guidance. In contrast, many genes downregulated by CJPE are associated with structural components of the cytoskeleton. In addition, CJPE suppressed genes associated with muscle structure and development. Taken together, this study provides extensive evidence that CJPE may have potential as a therapeutic agent for scalp treatment and hair growth promotion.",

Autologous MSCORS were obtained ex vivo by non-invasive plucking of hair and they were differentiated in vitro into both endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), two crucial cellular components of vascular grafts. Assessment was carried out by immunostaining, confocal laser-scanning microscopy, gene expression analysis (qRT-PCR), quantitative analysis of anastomotic network parameters, and cumulative length quantification of immunostained alpha-smooth muscle actin-containing stress fibers (alpha-SMA). In comparison to adipose mesenchymal stem cells, MSCORS exhibited a significantly higher differentiation efficiency according to key quantitative criteria and their endothelial derivatives demonstrated a higher angiogenic potential. Furthermore, the cells were capable of depositing their own extracellular matrix in vitro in the form of a membrane-cell sheet, serving as a base for viable co-culture of endothelial cells and SMCs integrated with their autologous matrix. Differentiated MSCORS hereby provided a complex autologous cell-matrix construct that demonstrates vascularization capacity and can serve as a base for personalized repair grafting applications.",

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is commonly accompanied by intense pain and is associated with high mortality rates. However, the effectiveness of existing therapeutic approaches remains unsatisfactory. Stem cell therapy, which can promote the regeneration of damaged tissue and alleviate systemic inflammatory responses, has brought new possibility for patients suffering from AP. In particular, hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HF-MSCs) are proposed as a suitable cell source for treating pancreatic diseases, but further research on their effectiveness, safety, and underlying mechanisms is warranted for clinical implementation. In this work, the therapeutic potential of HF-MSC transplantation was studied in an L-arginine-induced AP rat model. HF-MSCs were extracted from infant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, expanded in vitro, and detected by flow cytometry. HF-MSCs were labeled by PKH67 and transplanted into rats with AP via tail vein injection. Serum specimens were collected at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after transplantation, and the levels of amylase, lipase, and anti-inflammatory factors, namely interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), were analyzed. Pancreas samples were collected and assayed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry 1 week after transplantation to monitor the differentiation of HF-MSCs and the functional recovery of the damaged pancreas. Intravenously delivered rat HF-MSCs spontaneously homed to the damaged pancreas and expressed pancreatic progenitor cell markers, relieved inflammation, and boosted pancreatic regeneration. These findings indicate that HF-MSC transplantation is a potentially effective treatment for AP.",

Background: Vitiligo is a skin depigmentation disorder, for which, repigmentation treatment with combined follicular unit extraction (FUE) graft and narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) is considered superior to micro-punch graft therapy. BMP4 can induce MITF expression in Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs), and alpha-MSH subsequently promotes the differentiation of MITF-expressing cells along the melanocyte lineage. Objective: To investigate why FUE grafting is superior to epidermal mini grafting in promoting hair follicles (HF) melanocyte cell survival and longevity, we planned the in vitro experiments HF bulge NCSCs differentiate into melanocyte precursors under the co-treatment of BMP4 and alpha-MSH. Methods: Cells that migrated from the HF bulge of scalp were cultured and assessed using immunofluorescence. Transcriptome analysis was performed on RNA sequencing results. Results: Basic fibroblast growth factor promotes the proliferation and survival of NCSCs, with spontaneous differentiation into SOX10 +/SOX2 + glial progenitors, but not into SOX10 +/MITF + precursor melanocytes. Both BMP4 and alpha-MSH promoted the differentiation into MITF-expressing cells. RNA sequencing revealed a downregulation in neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and sermaphorin 3C (SEMA3C), and upregulation in WNT10A. Furthermore, FUE grafting had a source of reservoir melanocytes superior to mini-grafting in treatment for vitiligo. Conclusion: We obtained SOX10 +/MITF + precursor melanocytes through an induction of differentiation along the melanocyte lineage by BMP4 and alpha-MSH. According to the RNA sequencing results that NRG1 and SEMA3C were downregulated and WNT10A was upregulated, we postulated that HF NCSCs differentiated into melanocyte by co-treatment of BMP4 and alpha-MSH.

Ginsenoside Rg4 is a rare ginsenoside that is naturally found in ginseng, and exhibits a wide range of biological activities including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in several cell types. The purpose of this study was to use an in vivo model of hair follicle (HF)-mimic based on a human dermal papilla (DP) spheroid system prepared by three-dimensional (3D) culture and to investigate the effect of Rg4 on the hair-inductive properties of DP cells. Treatment of the DP spheroids with Rg4 (20 to 50 mug/ml) significantly increased the viability and size of the DP spheres in a dose-dependent manner. Rg4 also increased the mRNA and protein expression of DP signature genes that are related to hair growth including ALP, BMP2, and VCAN in the DP spheres. Analysis of the signaling molecules and luciferase reporter assays further revealed that Rg4 induces the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3beta, which activates the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway. These results correlated with not only the increased nuclear translocation of beta-catenin following the treatment of the DP spheres with Rg4 but also the significant elevation of mRNA expression of the downstream target genes of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway including WNT5A, beta-catenin, and LEF1.

Enhanced telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) levels in dermal keratinocytes can serve as a novel target for hair growth promotion. Previously, we identified fisetin using a system for screening food components that can activate the TERT promoter in HaCaT cells (keratinocytes). In the present study, we aimed to clarify the molecular basis of fisetin-induced hair growth promotion in mice. To this end, the dorsal skin of mice was treated with fisetin, and hair growth was evaluated 12 days after treatment. Histochemical analyses of fisetin-treated skin samples and HaCaT cells were performed to observe the effects of fisetin. The results showed that fisetin activated HaCaT cells by regulating the expression of various genes related to epidermogenesis, cell proliferation, hair follicle regulation, and hair cycle regulation. In addition, fisetin induced the secretion of exosomes from HaCaT cells, which activated beta-catenin and mitochondria in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and induced their proliferation. Moreover, these results revealed the existence of exosomes as the molecular basis of keratinocyte-HFSC interaction and showed that fisetin, along with its effects on keratinocytes, caused exosome secretion, thereby activating HFSCs. This is the first study to show that keratinocyte-derived exosomes can activate HFSCs and consequently induce hair growth.",

INTRODUCTION: Although it has been reported that the anti-diabetic drug metformin has multiple extra-hypoglycemic activities, such as anti-oxidation, anti-aging and even anti-tumor, topical metformin also can induce hair regeneration, but the precise mechanism involved in that process is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of metformin on hair growth in a mouse hair follicle reconstitution model generated by in vitro self-assembled three-dimensional aggregates of epidermal and dermal cells (3D aggregates). METHODS: Epidermal cells and dermal cells were isolated and cultured from the mouse skin of fifty C57BL/6 mouse pups (1-day-old). For tracing the distribution of dermal cells during the self-assembly process of 3D aggregates, the dermal cells were labeled with Vybrant Dil cell-labelling solution and mixed with epidermal cells at 1: 1 ratio. Formed 3D aggregates were treated with 10 mM metformin and then were grafted into recipient BALB/c nude mice. The biomarkers (HGF, CD133, ALP, beta-catenin and SOX2) associated with the hair-inductive activity of dermal cells were detected in the grafted skin tissues and in cultured 3D aggregates treated with metformin using immunofluorescent staining, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting. Furthermore, the expression levels of CD133 were also examined in dermal cells with different passage numbers using qRT-PCR and western blotting. RESULTS: Metformin directly stimulates the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of cultured 3D aggregates, upregulates both the protein and mRNA expression levels of molecular markers (HGF, CD133, ALP, beta-catenin and SOX2) and improves the survival rate of reconstituted hair follicles. Moreover, we also found that metformin increases the expression of CD133 in dermal cells thus maintaining their trichogenic capacity that would normally be lost by serial subculture. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that metformin can promote hair follicle regeneration in vitro through up-regulation of the hair inductive capability of dermal cells, warranting further evaluation in the clinical treatment of male or female pattern hair loss.",

One of the hits was ethanolic extract of Rhizoma Belamcandae, the rhizome of Belamcanda chinensis (L.) DC. Tectoridin, an isoflavone from Rhizoma Belamcandae, was shown to be responsible for this activation of promoter construct, inducing the transcription of pTOPFLASH in the transfected fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner.

The hair growth-promoting effects of tectoridin were illustrated in human follicular dermal papilla cells and mouse vibrissae organ cultures. In tectoridin-treated dermal papilla cultures, an activation of Wnt signaling was demonstrated by various indicative markers, including TCF/LEF1 transcriptional activity, nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, expressions level of mRNAs encoding axin-related protein, (AXIN2), beta-catenin, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF-1), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).

Introduction: Scalp biopsy is a standard method for the definitive diagnosis of alopecia. The hair count parameters of each scalp area remain unclear. This study aimed to determine hair count values at different scalp locations from histopathology and to establish reference values for each part of the scalp. Methods: We obtained biopsy specimens from the frontal, vertex, temporoparietal, and occipital areas of the scalps of normal deceased subjects. All specimens were evaluated for the number of follicular units, hair counts, hair types, and stages of the hair cycle. Results: In total, 240 specimens were collected from 60 cadavers. Across all scalp sites, the temporoparietal area showed the lowest mean hair count, number of follicular units, terminal and vellus hairs, and terminal-to-vellus hair ratio. The average anagen-to-telogen hair ratio was comparable across all scalp sites. This study did not observe a significant association of hair parameters with gender differences or increasing age in all scalp areas. Conclusions: The present study revealed the diversity of the hair index among different scalp areas and suggested that normal hair count values should be separately standardized on each scalp region. Our findings may provide useful reference values for the histopathological evaluation of hair disorders in Asians.",

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modification in linear RNA molecules. Over the last few years, interestingly, many circRNA molecules are also found to have extensive m6A modification sites with temporal and spatial specific expression patterns. To date, however, little information is available concerning the expression profiling and functional regulatory characteristics of m6A modified circRNAs (m6A-circRNAs) in secondary hair follicles (SHFs) of cashmere goats. In this study, a total of fifteen m6A-circRNAs were identified and characterized in the skin tissue of cashmere goats. Of these, six m6A-circRNAs were revealed to have significantly higher expression in skin at anagen compared with those at telogen. The constructed ceRNA network indicated a complicated regulatory relationship of the six anagen up-regulated m6A-circRNAs through miRNA mediated pathways. Several signaling pathways implicated in the physiological processes of hair follicles were enriched based on the potential regulatory genes of the six anagen up-regulated m6A-circRNAs, such as TGF-beta, axon guidance, ribosome, and stem cell pluripotency regulatory pathways, suggesting the analyzed m6A-circRNAs might be essentially involved in SHF development and cashmere growth in cashmere goats. Further, we showed that four m6A-circRNAs had highly similar expression trends to their host genes in SHFs of cashmere goats including m6A-circRNA-ZNF638,-TULP4,-DNAJB6, and-CAT. However, the expression patterns of two m6A-circRNAs (m6A-circRNA-STAM2 and-CAAP1) were inconsistent with the linear RNAs from their host genes in the SHFs of cashmere goats. These results provide novel information for eluci-dating the biological function and regulatory characteristics of the m6A-circRNAs in SHF development and cashmere growth in goats.",

    "text": "Autoantigen Discovery in the Hair Loss Disorder, Alopecia Areata: Implication of Post-Translational Modifications. Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, multifactorial, polygenic, and heterogeneous disorder affecting growing hair follicles in susceptible individuals, which results in a non-scarring and reversible hair loss with a highly unpredictable course. Despite very considerable research effort, the nature of the precipitating factor (s) responsible for initiating AA in any given hair follicle remains unclear, due largely to significant gaps in our knowledge of the precise sequence of the etiopathogenic events in this dermatosis. However, disease-related changes in the immune-competence of the lower growing hair follicle, together with an active immune response (humoral and cellular) to hair follicle-associated antigens, are key associated phenomena. Confirmation of the hair follicle antigen (s) implicated in AA disease onset has remained stubbornly elusive. While it may be considered somewhat philosophical by some, it is also unclear whether immune-mediated hair loss in AA results from a) an ectopic (i. e., in an abnormal location) immune response to native (unmodified) self-antigens expressed by the healthy hair follicle, b) a normal immune response against modified self-antigens (or neoantigens), or c) a normal immune response against self-antigens (modified/non-modified) that were not previously visible to the immune system (because they were conformationally-hidden or sequestered) but become exposed and presentable in an MHC-I/-II molecule-restricted manner. While some candidate hair follicle antigen target (s) in AA are beginning to emerge, with a potential role for trichohyalin, it is not yet clear whether this represents the initial and immunodominant antigenic focus in AA or is simply one of an expanding repertoire of exposed hair follicle tissue damage-associated antigens that are secondary to the disease. Confirmation of autoantigen identity is essential for our understanding of AA etiopathogenesis, and consequently for developing a more informed therapeutic strategy. Major strides have been made in autoantigen discovery in other autoimmune conditions. In particular, some of these conditions may provide insights into how post-translational modifications (e. g., citrullination, deamidation, etc.) of hair follicle-restricted proteins may increase their antigenicity and so help drive the anti-hair follicle immune attack in AA.",

Small DNA oligonucleotides homologous to the 3 ' overhang of human telomeres, called T-oligos, stimulate pigmentation in human epidermal melanocytes in vitro and in vivo. They induce UV-mimetic effects in the absence of DNA-damage, however, it is unknown how T-oligos affect human hair follicle keratinocyte and melanocyte functions in situ. Here, we present the first evidence that these oligonucleotides are powerful modulators of pigmentation and growth of microdissected, organ-cultured human scalp hair follicles. Hair follicles were incubated with T-oligo or vehicle control and were then assessed for changes in hair shaft length, follicle morphology, pigmentation, proliferation and apoptosis. After only 48 h, T-oligos induced a fourfold increase in pigmentation of human anagen VI hair bulbs, while hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation was reduced by 65%, without apparent changes in hair bulb cell apoptosis. This corresponded well with a significant inhibition of hair shaft elongation, which was not accompanied by premature catagen induction in anagen VI hair follicles. These diametrically opposed effects of T-oligos on human hair follicle melanocytes (stimulation of melanogenesis) versus human hair bulb keratinocytes (inhibition of proliferation) in situ illustrate that human hair follicle organ culture offers an excellent tool for T-oligo research.

Here, we demonstrate the central role of Dlx3 as a crucial transcriptional regulator of hair formation and regeneration. The selective ablation of Dlx3 in the epidermis results in complete alopecia owing to failure of the hair shaft and inner root sheath to form, which is caused by the abnormal differentiation of the cortex. Significantly, we elucidate the regulatory cascade that positions Dlx3 downstream of Wnt signaling and as an upstream regulator of other transcription factors that regulate hair follicle differentiation, such as Hoxc13 and Gata3. Colocalization of phospho-Smad1/5/8 and Dlx3 is consistent with a regulatory role for BMP signaling to Dlx3 during hair morphogenesis. Importantly, mutant catagen follicles undergo delayed regression and display persistent proliferation. Moreover, ablation of Dlx3 expression in the telogen bulge stem cells is associated with a loss of BMP signaling, precluding re-initiation of the hair follicle growth cycle. Taken together with hair follicle abnormalities in humans with Tricho-Dento-Osseous (TDO) syndrome, an autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia linked to mutations in the DLX3 gene, our results establish that Dlx3 is essential for hair morphogenesis, differentiation and cycling programs.",

Hair is a primary characteristic of mammals, and exerts a wide range of functions including thermoregulation, physical protection, sensory activity, and social interactions. The hair shaft consists of terminally differentiated keratinocytes that are produced by the hair follicle. Hair follicle development takes place during fetal skin development and relies on tightly regulated ectodermal-mesodermal interactions. After birth, mature and actively growing hair follicles eventually become anchored in the subcutis, and periodically regenerate by spontaneously undergoing repetitive cycles of growth (anagen), apoptosis-driven regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen). Our molecular understanding of hair follicle biology relies heavily on mouse mutants with abnormalities in hair structure, growth, and/or pigmentation. These mice have allowed novel insights into important general molecular and cellular processes beyond skin and hair biology, ranging from organ induction, morphogenesis and regeneration, to pigment and stem cell biology, cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis.

In the adult hair follicle, HMGN1 is specifically expressed in the basal layer of epidermis, in the outer root sheath, in the hair bulb, but not in the inner root sheath and hair shaft.

The organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs) is the best currently available assay for hair research in the human system. In order to determine the hair growth-modulatory effects of agents in this assay, one critical read-out parameter is the assessment of whether the test agent has prolonged anagen duration or induced catagen in vitro. However, objective criteria to distinguish between anagen VI HFs and early catagen in human HF organ culture, two hair cycle stages with a deceptively similar morphology, remain to be established. Here, we develop, document and test an objective classification system that allows to distinguish between anagen VI and early catagen in organ-cultured human HFs, using both qualitative and quantitative parameters that can be generated by light microscopy or immunofluorescence. Seven qualitative classification criteria are defined that are based on assessing the morphology of the hair matrix, the dermal papilla and the distribution of pigmentary markers (melanin, gp100). These are complemented by ten quantitative parameters. We have tested this classification system by employing the clinically used topical hair growth inhibitor, eflornithine, and show that eflornithine indeed produces the expected premature catagen induction, as identified by the novel classification criteria reported here. Therefore, this classification system offers a standardized, objective and reproducible new experimental method to reliably distinguish between human anagen VI and early catagen HFs in organ culture.",

METHODS: Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into scald group, treatment group, sham group, with 6 rats in each group. The rats in scald group and treatment group were subjected to 30% TBSA partial thickness scald on the back, and were resuscitated with balanced solution after 1 hour, while those in sham group were immersed in water at 37 degrees C for 25 s to simulate scald, and did not receive fluid replacement. Rats in treatment group were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg melatonin solution at 1 minute, 8 hours and 12 hours after scald, while those in sham group and scald group were given equal volume of 1% alcohol sodium-isotonic saline instead. Tissue samples were harvested at 6, 12 and 24 post scald hours (PSH) for determination of MDA and GSH levels. Apoptosis of residul hair follicle was detected by TUNEL method and immunohistochemistry of caspase-3. RESULTS: The level of MDA in scald group at each time point was much higher than that in sham group (P < 0. 01) and treatment group (P < 0. 05), and it peaked at 12 PSH. The changes in GSH were just opposite to that of MDA. Under fluorescence microscope, the residual hair follicle cells were blue, and the apoptotic cells appeared green. The apoptosis rate in scald group at 6, 12, 24 PSH was obviously higher than that in sham (P < 0. 01) and treatment groups (P < 0. 05), which was (20. 2 +/-3. 4)% vs (4. 3 +/-2. 3)% vs (10. 9 +/-3. 2)%, (31. 2 +/-3. 6)% vs (5. 1 +/-2. 5)% vs (19. 1 +/-3. 7)%, (22. 4 +/-2. 7)% vs (4. 1 +/-2. 4)% vs (13. 1 +/-3. 4)%, respectively.

The location of the hfPS cells has been termed the hfPS cell area (hfPSCA). Previously, hfPS cells were cultured for 1-2 months before transplantation to the injured nerve or spinal cord which would not be optimal for clinical application of these cells for nerve or spinal cord repair, since the patient should be treated soon after injury. In the present study, we addressed this issue by directly using the upper part of the hair follicle containing the hfPSCA, without culture, for injection into the severed sciatic nerve in mice. After injection of hfPSCA, the implanted hfPS cells grew and promoted joining of the severed nerve. The transplanted hfPS cells differentiated mostly to glial cells forming myelin sheaths, which promoted axonal growth and functional recovery of the severed nerve.

The nuclear factor I C (NFI-C) transcription factor has been implicated in tooth development, but a potential role in hair growth had not been assessed. In this study we found that NFI-C regulates the onset of the hair growth cycle. NFI-C (-/-) mice were delayed in the transition from the telogen to anagen phase of the hair follicle cycle after either experimental depilation or spontaneous hair loss. Lack of NFI-C resulted in delayed induction of the sonic hedgehog, Wnt5a, and Lef1 gene expression, which are key regulators of the hair follicle growth initiation. NFI-C (-/-) mice also showed elevated levels of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), an inhibitor of keratinocyte proliferation, and of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 at telogen. Reduced expression of Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation, was noted at the onset of anagen, indicating impaired activation of the hair progenitor cells. These findings implicate NFI-C in the repression of TGF-beta1 signaling during telogen stage, resulting in the delay of progenitor cell proliferation and hair follicle regeneration in NFI-C-deficient mice. Taken together with prior observations, these findings also designate NFI-C as a regulator of adult progenitor cell proliferation and of postnatal tissue growth or regeneration.",

However, the known cellular and molecular mechanisms are limited. Gsdma3 is a novel murine gene and considered to be a mutation hotspot. Six mutants have been reported in Gsdma3 and all these mutants exhibit hair loss and hyperkeratosis phenotypes. In order to verify how the lack of Gsdma3 affects the hair defects, we use alopecia and excoriation mice, a new mouse mutation in this gene, as our research model. This mutation exhibits progressive hair loss, from head to the whole back, and followed by hair regrowth. We test that Gsdma3 is expressed in matrix, inner root sheath, and hair shaft. Ultrastructural and histological analyses show abnormal hair structures and reduced hair keratins in AE mice. The loss of interlocking structures and abnormal constitutive protein indicate defects in anchoring hair shaft in the hair follicle and resisting external forces. Molecular analysis of Gsdma3 deficiency and overexpression shows an Msx2/Foxn1/acidic hair keratin genetic pathway is involved. Thus, Gsdma3 is necessary for normal hair follicle differentiation.",

Among the Hox genes, homeobox C13 (Hoxc13) has been shown to be essential for proper hair shaft differentiation, as Hoxc13 gene-targeted (Hoxc13 (tm1Mrc)) mice completely lack external hair. Because of the remarkable overt phenotypic parallels to the Foxn1 (nu) (nude) mutant mice, we sought to determine whether Hoxc13 and forkhead box N1 (Foxn1) might act in a common pathway of hair follicle (HF) differentiation. We show that the alopecia exhibited by both the Hoxc13 (tm1Mrc) and Foxn1 (nu) mice is because of strikingly similar defects in hair shaft differentiation and that both mutants suffer from a severe nail dystrophy. These phenotypic similarities are consistent with the extensive overlap between Hoxc13 and Foxn1 expression patterns in the HF and the nail matrix. Furthermore, DNA microarray analysis of skin from Hoxc13 (tm1Mrc) mice identified Foxn1 as significantly downregulated along with numerous hair keratin genes. This Foxn1 downregulation apparently reflects the loss of direct transcriptional control by HOXC13 as indicated by our results obtained through co-transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. As presented in the discussion, these data support a regulatory model of keratinocyte differentiation in which HOXC13-dependent activation of Foxn1 is part of a regulatory cascade controlling the expression of terminal differentiation markers.",

Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) interact with epithelial stem cells and induce hair folliculogenesis. Cell-based therapies using expanded DPCs for hair regeneration have been unsuccessful in humans. Two major challenges remain: first, expanded DPCs obtained from adult hair follicles have functional limitations ; second, a clinically applicable method is needed for transplanting DPCs. This study aimed to identify an efficient, minimally invasive and economical DPC transplantation procedure for use in clinical settings. Five clinically applicable transplantation procedures were tested, termed the Pinhole, Laser, Slit, Non-vascularized sandwich (NVS) and Hemi-vascularized sandwich (HVS) methods. Labelled rat dermal papilla tissue was transplanted into rat sole skin, and hair follicle regeneration was evaluated histologically. Regenerated follicles and labelled DPCs were detected for all methods, although some follicles showed abnormal growth, i. e. a cystic or inverted appearance. The HVS method, pioneered here, resulted in significantly larger number of regenerated follicles that were more mature and regular than those observed using the other methods. Moreover, hair growth was detected after expanded adult-derived DPC transplantation using the HVS method. These results suggest that direct contact of epithelial and dermal components and better vascularization/oxygenation of the recipient site are critical for hair regeneration in cell-based therapies.",

We found that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) from neurons signals to a population of cells in the telogen bulge marked by the Hedgehog response gene Gli1. Gli1-expressing bulge cells function as multipotent stem cells in their native environment and repeatedly regenerate the anagen follicle. Shh-responding perineural bulge cells incorporate into healing skin wounds where, notably, they can change their lineage into epidermal stem cells. The perineural niche (including Shh) is dispensable for follicle contributions to acute wound healing and skin homeostasis, but is necessary to maintain bulge cells capable of becoming epidermal stem cells.

Induction of massive apoptosis of hair follicle cells by chemotherapy has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA), but the underlying mechanisms of regulation are not well understood. The present study investigated the apoptotic effect of cisplatin in human hair follicle dermal papilla cells and HaCaT keratinocytes, and determined the identity and role of specific reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the process. Treatment of the cells with cisplatin induced ROS generation and a parallel increase in caspase activation and apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of ROS generation by antioxidants inhibited the apoptotic effect of cisplatin, indicating the role of ROS in the process. Studies using specific ROS scavengers further showed that hydroxyl radical, but not hydrogen peroxide or superoxide anion, is the primary oxidative species responsible for the apoptotic effect of cisplatin. Electron spin resonance studies confirmed the formation of hydroxyl radicals induced by cisplatin. The mechanism by which hydroxyl radical mediates the apoptotic effect of cisplatin was shown to involve down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 through ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation. Bcl-2 was also shown to have a negative regulatory role on hydroxyl radical. Together, our results indicate an essential role of hydroxyl radical in cisplatin-induced cell death of hair follicle cells through Bcl-2 regulation. Since CIA is a major side effect of cisplatin and many other chemotherapeutic agents with no known effective treatments, the knowledge gained from this study could be useful in the design of preventive treatment strategies for CIA through localized therapy without compromising the chemotherapy efficacy.",

Recent genetic studies of human hair disorders have suggested a critical role of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) signalling in hair follicle development, mediated by an LPA-producing enzyme, phosphatidic acid-selective phospholipase A (1) alpha (PA-PLA (1) alpha, also known as LIPH), and a recently identified LPA receptor, P2Y5 (also known as LPA (6)). However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling underlies LPA-induced hair follicle development. PA-PLA (1) alpha-deficient mice generated in this study exhibited wavy hairs due to the aberrant formation of the inner root sheath (IRS) in hair follicles, which resembled mutant mice defective in tumour necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme (TACE), transforming growth factor alpha (TGFalpha) and EGFR. PA-PLA (1) alpha was co-localized with TACE, TGFalpha and tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR in the IRS. In PA-PLA (1) alpha-deficient hair follicles, cleaved TGFalpha and tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR, as well as LPA, were significantly reduced. LPA, P2Y5 agonists and recombinant PA-PLA (1) alpha enzyme induced P2Y5-and TACE-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGFalpha through G12/13 pathway and consequent EGFR transactivation in vitro. These data demonstrate that a PA-PLA (1) alpha-LPA-P2Y5 axis regulates differentiation and maturation of hair follicles via a TACE-TGFalpha-EGFR pathway, thus underscoring the physiological importance of LPA-induced EGFR transactivation.",

Varying the dosage of Shh now supports these inferences. In Shh knockout mice, mice were totally hairless: primary and secondary hair follicle germs were formed, but further progression failed. Consistent with these findings, when Shh loss was restricted to the skin, secondary hair follicle germs were initiated on time in Tabby mice, but their subsequent development (down-growth) failed. An Shh transgene expressed in Tabby skin could not restore induction of primary hair follicles, but restored normal length to the somewhat aberrant secondary hair that was formed and prolonged the anagen phase of hair cycling.

The aim of this study was to reveal the factors that determine the direction of hair follicle growth after reconstruction with dissociated cells. METHODS: We designed an enclosed chamber assay in which a chamber was buried under nude mouse skin that was not exposed to the air, as in a traditional chamber assay. Inductive dermal cells and epithelial cells dissociated from neonatal C57 BL/6 mice were injected into the chamber and dermis for patch assays. The direction of newly formed hair follicles was analysed. RESULTS: Newly formed hair follicles in the enclosed chamber were arranged randomly parallel to the skin on the surface of the panniculus carnosus.

Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-induced collapse of hair follicle (HF) immune privilege (IP) is a key element in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata. In this pilot study, we investigated whether the immunosuppressive neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), can protect from and/or restore IFNgamma-induced HF-IP collapse. After showing that human scalp HFs express CGRP receptor-like receptor (CRLR) immunoreactivity, anagen HFs were cultured in the presence of IFNgamma, with CGRP added before or after. Adding CGRP after IFNgamma administration (' restoration assay ') failed to downregulate IFNgamma-induced ectopic MHC class I expression, while MHC class II expression was reduced. However, administering CGRP before IFNgamma application (' protection assay ') significantly reduced the IFNgamma-induced overexpression and ectopic expression of MHC class I and II and reduced the increased degranulation of perifollicular mast cells induced by IFNgamma. This suggests that CGRP may not restore HF-IP once it has collapsed, but may protect it from collapsing. Therefore, CRLR stimulation might help to retard AA progression.",

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the strongest regulators of physiological and pathological angiogenesis. VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), the primary receptor for VEGF, is thought to mediate major functional effects of VEGF. Previously, we have localized both VEGF and VEGFR-2 in human hair follicles. In this study, we further defined the expression and roles of VEGFR-2 on human hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) cells. The expression of VEGFR-2 on DP cells was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis separately, and localization of VEGFR-2 was defined by immunofluorescence. The effect of VEGF on DP cells was analyzed by MTT assays and specific inhibitors. Finally, the role of VEGF involved in the signaling pathways was investigated by Western blot. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated the expression of VEGFR-2 on DP cells. Immunostaining for VEGFR-2 showed strong signal on cultured human DP cells in vitro. Exogenous VEGF (165) stimulated proliferation of DP cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, this stimulation was blocked by a VEGFR-2 neutralizing antibody (MAB3571) and an ERK inhibitor (PD98059). VEGF (165)-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was abolished by MAB3571 and PD98059, while the phosphorylation of p38, JNK and AKT were not changed by VEGF (165).

    "text": "Expression of Kruppel-like factor KLF4 in mouse hair follicle stem cells contributes to cutaneous wound healing. BACKGROUND: Kruppel-like factor KLF4 is a transcription factor critical for the establishment of the barrier function of the skin. Its function in stem cell biology has been recently recognized. Previous studies have revealed that hair follicle stem cells contribute to cutaneous wound healing. However, expression of KLF4 in hair follicle stem cells and the importance of such expression in cutaneous wound healing have not been investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed higher KLF4 expression in hair follicle stem cell-enriched mouse skin keratinocytes than that in control keratinocytes. We generated KLF4 promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescence protein (KLF4/EGFP) transgenic mice and tamoxifen-inducible KLF4 knockout mice by crossing KLF4 promoter-driven Cre recombinase fused with tamoxifen-inducible estrogen receptor (KLF4/CreER) transgenic mice with KLF4 (flox) mice. KLF4/EGFP cells purified from dorsal skin keratinocytes of KLF4/EGFP transgenic mice were co-localized with 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-label retaining cells by flow cytometric analysis and immunohistochemistry. Lineage tracing was performed in the context of cutaneous wound healing, using KLF4/CreER and Rosa26RLacZ double transgenic mice, to examine the involvement of KLF4 in wound healing. We found that KLF4 expressing cells were likely derived from bulge stem cells. In addition, KLF4 expressing multipotent cells migrated to the wound and contributed to the wound healing. After knocking out KLF4 by tamoxifen induction of KLF4/CreER and KLF4 (flox) double transgenic mice, we found that the population of bulge stem cell-enriched population was decreased, which was accompanied by significantly delayed cutaneous wound healing. Consistently, KLF4 knockdown by KLF4-specific small hairpin RNA in human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells decreased the stem cell population and was accompanied by compromised cell migration. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: KLF4 expression in mouse hair bulge stem cells plays an important role in cutaneous wound healing. These findings may enable future development of KLF4-based therapeutic strategies aimed at accelerating cutaneous wound closure.",

However, the cellular organisation of this much-studied model is not fully understood. The structures of the outer layer and of the bulb, which ensures HF growth, have not been completely established. To clarify these points, we have conducted in vivo clonal analyses with 3D imaging in mice. The upper two-thirds of the HF outer layer consists of two clonally unrelated groups of cells that exhibit different modes of growth. They correspond to the basal outer root sheath (ORS) and the companion layer (Cp). The basal ORS has an unusual anisotropic mode of growth from a suprabulbar zone, which we named the privileged proliferation zone. The Cp has a stem/transient-amplifying mode of growth and is shown to be an HF internal structure. Furthermore, we describe an additional element, the bulb outer layer, which is contiguous and shares markers (e. g. Lgr5) with the basal ORS but is formed by a separate lineage that belongs neither to the ORS nor Cp lineage. It represents a novel element with proximal cells that are contiguous with the germinative layer in the bulb. In reference to its shape and position we named it the lower proximal cup (LPC). These clonal hierarchies reveal a novel model of HF organisation and growth based on two major entities: the basal ORS and the LPC plus the seven internal layers.",

Organ size and numbers are vital issues in bioengineering for hair follicle (HF) regeneration. Murine HF dermal papilla (DP) cells are able to induce HF neogenesis when transplanted as aggregates. However, how the preparation of murine and human DP aggregates affects HF inductivity and the size of regenerated HF is yet to be determined. Here we report a scalable method for production of controllable human and rat DP spheroids in general labs for reproducible experiments. Compared with more hydrophobic polyethylene and poly (ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol), DP cells are poorly adhesive to hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Seeded in PVA-coated 96-welled commercial PCR tube arrays, DP cells quickly aggregate into single spheroids with progressive compaction. Varying seeded cell numbers and culture periods enables us to control the size and cell number of the spheroids. The spheroids obtained have high viability and preserve DP characters. A proof of principle experiment was conducted to examine the size effect on the efficiency and efficacy of HF regeneration. We found that both human and rat DP spheroids are able to induce HF neogenesis and larger DP spheroids exhibit higher HF inductivity. However, the average diameter of regenerated hair fiber did not significantly change with the increasing size of transplanted DP spheroids. The result suggests that an appropriate size of DP spheroid is essential for HF inductivity, but its size cannot be directly translated to a thicker regenerated hair. Our results also have implications on the efficiency and efficacy in the regeneration of other epithelial organs.",

Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of growth-related immediate-early, cytoskeletal, and muscle-specific genes to control growth, differentiation, and cytoskeletal integrity in different cell types. To investigate the role for SRF in epidermal development and homeostasis, we conditionally knocked out SRF in epidermal keratinocytes. We report that SRF deletion disrupted epidermal barrier function leading to early postnatal lethality. Mice lacking SRF in epidermis displayed morphogenetic defects, including an eye-open-at-birth phenotype and lack of whiskers. SRF-null skin exhibited abnormal morphology, hyperplasia, aberrant expression of differentiation markers and transcriptional regulators, anomalous actin organization, enhanced inflammation, and retarded hair follicle (HF) development. Transcriptional profiling experiments uncovered profound molecular changes in SRF-null E17. 5 epidermis and revealed that many previously identified SRF target CArG box-containing genes were markedly upregulated in SRF-null epidermis, indicating that SRF may function to repress transcription of a subset of its target genes in epidermis. Remarkably, when transplanted onto nude mice, engrafted SRF-null skin lacked hair but displayed normal epidermal architecture with proper expression of differentiation markers, suggesting that although keratinocyte SRF is essential for HF development, a cross-talk between SRF-null keratinocytes and the surrounding microenvironment is likely responsible for the barrier-deficient mutant epidermal phenotype.",

The accurate maintenance of genomic integrity is essential for tissue homeostasis. Deregulation of this process leads to cancer and aging. BRCA1 is a critical mediator of this process. Here, we performed conditional deletion of Brca1 during epidermal development and found that BRCA1 is specifically required for hair follicle (HF) formation and for development of adult HF stem cells (SCs). Mice deficient for Brca1 in the epidermis are hairless and display a reduced number of HFs that degenerate progressively. Surprisingly, the interfollicular epidermis and the sebaceous glands remain unaffected by Brca1 deletion. Interestingly, HF matrix transient amplifying progenitors present increased DNA damage, p53 stabilization, and caspase-dependent apoptosis compared with the interfollicular and sebaceous progenitors, leading to hyperproliferation, apoptosis, and subsequent depletion of the prospective adult HF SCs. Concomitant deletion of p53 and Brca1 rescues the defect of HF morphogenesis and loss of HF SCs. During adult homeostasis, BRCA1 is dispensable for quiescent bulge SCs, but upon their activation during HF regeneration, Brca1 deletion causes apoptosis and depletion of Brca1-deficient bulge SCs. Our data reveal a major difference in the requirement of BRCA1 between different types of epidermal SCs and progenitors and during the different activation stages of adult HF SCs.",

In this study, ectodermal precursor cells (EPCs) with the capacity to cross talk with hair-inductive dermal cells were generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and assessed for HF-forming ability in vivo. EPCs derived from three hiPSC lines generated with 4 or 3 factors (POU5F1, SOX2, KLF4 +/-MYC) mostly expressed keratin 18, a marker of epithelial progenitors.

DP cells preferentially increased DP biomarker expression in response to this line. Interestingly, 201B7 hiPSCs were shown to be ectodermal/epithelial prone, and the derived EPCs were putatively in a wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT)-activated state. Importantly, co-transplantation of 201B7 hiPSC-EPCs, but not NHKCs, with trichogenic mice dermal cells into immunodeficient mice resulted in HF formation. Human HF stem cell markers were detected in reconstituted HFs ; however, a low frequency of human-derived cells implied that hiPSC-EPCs contributed to HF morphogenesis via direct repopulation and non-cell autonomous activities.

BACKGROUND: Keratinocytes in the hair follicle bulge region have a high proliferative capacity, with characteristics of epithelial stem cells. This cell population might thus be an ideal source for generating the interfollicular epidermis in a canine skin equivalent. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to determine the ability of canine hair follicle bulge cell-enriched keratinocytes to construct canine living skin equivalents with interfollicular epidermis in vitro. ANIMALS: Four healthy beagle dogs from a research colony. METHODS: Bulge cell-enriched keratinocytes showing keratin 15 immunoreactivity were isolated from canine hair follicles and cultured on dermal equivalent containing canine fibroblasts. Skin equivalents were subjected to histological, immunohistochemical, western blot and RT-PCR analyses after 10-14 days of culture at the air-liquid interface. RESULTS: The keratinocyte sheets showed an interfollicular epidermal structure comprising four to five living cell layers covered with a horny layer. Immunoreactivities for keratin 14 and desmoglein 3 were detected in the basal and immediate suprabasilar layers of the epidermis, while keratin 10 and desmoglein 1 occurred in more superficial layers. Claudin 1 immunoreactivity was seen in the suprabasalar layer of the constructed epidermis, and filaggrin monomers and loricrin were detected in the uppermost layer. Basal keratinocytes in the skin equivalent demonstrated immunoreactivity to antibodies against basement membrane zone molecules. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A bulge stem cell-enriched population from canine hair follicles formed interfollicular epidermis within 2 weeks in vitro, and thus represents a promising model for regenerative therapy of canine skin.",

    "text": "Topobiology of human pigmentation: P-cadherin selectively stimulates hair follicle melanogenesis. P-cadherin serves as a major topobiological cue in mammalian epithelium. In human hair follicles (HFs), it is prominently expressed in the inner hair matrix that harbors the HF pigmentary unit. However, the role of P-cadherin in normal human pigmentation remains unknown. As patients with mutations in the gene that encodes P-cadherin show hypotrichosis and fair hair, we explored the hypothesis that P-cadherin may control HF pigmentation. When P-cadherin was silenced in melanogenically active organ-cultured human scalp HFs, this significantly reduced HF melanogenesis and tyrosinase activity as well as gene and/or protein expression of gp100, stem cell factor, c-Kit, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), both in situ and in isolated human HF melanocytes. Instead, epidermal pigmentation was unaffected by P-cadherin knockdown in organ-cultured human skin. In hair matrix keratinocytes, P-cadherin silencing reduced plasma membrane beta-catenin, whereas glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) and phospho-beta-catenin expression were significantly upregulated. This suggests that P-cadherin-GSK3beta/Wnt signaling is required for maintaining the expression of MITF to sustain intrafollicular melanogenesis. Thus, P-cadherin-mediated signaling is a melanocyte subtype-specific topobiological regulator of normal human pigmentation, possibly via GSK3beta-mediated canonical Wnt signaling.",

BACKGROUND: Vitiligo is an acquired disorder of pigmentation caused by loss of epidermal melanocytes. Autologous noncultured epidermal cell suspension (NCES) and autologous noncultured extracted hair follicle outer root sheath cell suspension (NCORSHFS) are important surgical modalities for the treatment of stable vitiligo. OBJECTIVES: To compare NCES and NCORSHFS for producing repigmentation in stable vitiligo. METHODS: We randomized 30 patients with 47 stable vitiligo lesions into two groups. Patients in group 1 were treated with NCES, and those in group 2 with NCORSHFS. They were evaluated 16 weeks postsurgery for the extent of repigmentation, colour match, change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The extent of repigmentation was excellent (90-100% repigmentation) in 83% of lesions in the NCES group and 65% of lesions in the NCORSHFS group (P = 0 154). Repigmentation > = 75% (good repigmentation) was observed in 92% of lesions in the NCES group and 78% of lesions in the NCORSHFS group (P = 0 425). There was a significant improvement in DLQI score in both the groups, but the mean decrease among groups did not differ significantly (P = 0 244). However, patients in the NCES group were significantly more satisfied than the patients in the NCORSHFS group. No significant difference was seen in colour match and pattern of repigmentation. Adverse effects were minimal. CONCLUSIONS: Both NCES and NCORSHFS are safe and effective techniques with comparable efficacy.

Our goal was to investigate the modulation of expression of various factors already known to be part of the hair placode formation, and to identify novel factors involved during the initiation of this process. In mice, primary hair follicles arise in utero from E12. 5 mouse embryos. Back skin RNA were extracted from E12. 5 to E14. 5 embryos to perform microarray analysis (Affymetrix). We identified four new Wnt related genes which could be involved in hair follicle initiation because of their maximum expression at E12. 5, namely two activators: Wnt-2 and Zic-1 and two inhibitors: Dkk-2 and Dact-1. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reactions confirmed their expression.

Using fusion tags, expression of recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 18 (rhFGF18) in mammalian cells and Escherichia coli has been extensively used for fundamental research and clinical applications, including chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, hair growth, and neuroprotection. However, high-level rhFGF18 expression is difficult and the products are often not homogeneous. Furthermore, fusion-tagged protein has higher immunogenicity and lower bioactivity, and the removal of the fused tag is expensive. To overcome the limitations of fusion-tagged expression of protein and to prepare soluble highly bioactive rhFGF18, we have developed a rapid and efficient expression strategy. Optimized hFGF18 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET22b and pET3c vectors, then transformed into E. coli strains Origima (DE3) and BL21 (DE3) PlysS. The best combination of plasmid and host strain was selected, and only Origima (DE3)/pET3c-rhFGF18 was screened for high-level expressed rhFGF18. Under optimal conditions in a 30-L fermentor, the average bacterial yield and expression level of rhFGF18 of three batches were more than 652 g and 30% respectively, after treatment with 1 mM isopropyl-thio-beta-galactopyranoside for 10 h at 25 C. The target protein was purified by CM Sepharose FF and heparin affinity chromatography. The purity of rhFGF18 was shown by HPLC to be higher than 95%, and the yield was 155 mg/L. In vitro MTT assays demonstrated that the purified rhFGF18 could stimulate significant proliferation of NIH3T3 cells, and animal experiments showed that rhFGF18 could effectively regulate hair growth. In conclusion, this may be a better method of producing rhFGF18 to meet the increasing demand in its pharmacological application.",

BACKGROUND: Hair follicles house a permanent pool of epithelial stem cells. Intense pulsed light (IPL) sources have been successfully used for hair removal, but long-term hair reduction may require several treatments. Many questions remain regarding the impact of IPL treatment on the structure of the hair follicle, more specifically on hair follicular stem cells and dermal papilla cells, a group of specialized cells that orchestrate hair growth. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the destruction of human hair follicles and surrounding tissues following IPL treatment, with more attention paid to the bulge and the bulb regions. METHODS: Human scalp specimens of Fitzpatrick skin phototype II were exposed ex vivo to IPL pulses and were then processed for histological analysis, immunodetection of stem cell-associated keratin 19, and revelation of the endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity expressed in dermal papilla cells. RESULTS: Histological analysis confirmed that pigmented structures, such as the melanin-rich matrix cells of the bulb in anagen follicles and the hair shaft, are principally targeted by IPL treatment, while white hairs and epidermis remained unaffected. Damage caused by heat sometimes extended over the dermal papilla cells, while stem cells were mostly spared. CONCLUSIONS: IPL epilation principally targets pigmented structures. Our results suggest that, under the tested conditions, collateral damage does not deplete stem cells. Damage at the dermal papilla was observed only with high-energy treatment modalities. Extrapolated to frequently treated hairs, these observations explain why some hairs grow back after a single IPL treatment.",

BACKGROUND: The recently discovered leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 6 (LGR6 +) epithelial stem cell located within the follicular bulge of the adnexal compartment is capable of producing all cellular lineages of the skin. In this study, the authors sought to determine whether these cells can be transplanted for use as a type of cellular therapy for the repair of full-thickness wounds in which the native stem cell niche has been obliterated. METHODS: Full-thickness murine skin was harvested and LGR6 (+ GFP) epithelial stem cells were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. This enriched epithelial stem cell population was then transplanted by means of local injection into wound beds on the dorsum of nude mice. Viability, migration, healing, the development of nascent hair follicles, and gene and proteomic expression studies were performed to determine whether the engraftment of LGR6 (+ GFP) epithelial stem cells enhanced healing when compared with controls. RESULTS: Wound beds receiving LGR6 (+ GFP) epithelial stem cells showed enhanced healing ; nascent follicle growth ; and augmentation of the Wnt, vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor pathways when compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: The LGR6 + epithelial stem cells appear to hold great promise for the development of a clinically useful stem cell-based therapy for the repair of full-thickness wounds and hair regeneration.

Cell clones that stably expressed red fluorescence were obtained after selection with Geneticin (G418). The transgene in the cell clones was examined by polymerase chain reaction to verify that exogenous DNA (pKAP6-1 and IGFBP-5) had integrated stably into GFb cells. These data suggest that this method can be used for the construction of a hair follicle-specific expression vector for functional genetic analyses and for obtaining stable transfection donor cells for nuclear transfer.",

Human skin maintains the ability to regenerate during adulthood, as it constantly renews itself throughout adult life, and the hair follicle (HF) undergoes a perpetual cycle of growth and degeneration. The study of stem cells (SCs) in the epidermis and skin tissue engineering is a rapidly emerging field, where advances have been made in both basic and clinical research. Advances in basic science include the ability to assay SCs of the epidermis in vivo, identification of an independent interfollicular epidermal SC, and improved ability to analyze individual SCs divisions, as well as the recent hair organ regeneration via the bioengineered hair follicular unit transplantation (FUT) in mice. Advances in the clinic include recognition of the importance of SCs for wound repair and for gene therapy in inherited skin diseases, for example epidermolysis bullosa. The study of the HF stem cells (HFSCs) started by identification of epidermal SC in the HF bulge as quiescent \" \" label retaining cells \" \". The research of these cells emerged rapidly after the identification of bulge cell molecular markers, such as keratin 15 (K15) and CD34 in mice and CD200 in humans, which allowed the isolation and characterization of bulge cells from follicles.

We isolated mesenchymal stem cells from human hair follicles.

These acellular arterial scaffolds retained major components of the extracellular matrix. The mechanical properties of these acellular arterial scaffolds were very similar to those of native blood vessels. We then seeded HF-MSCs into acellular arterial scaffolds and found that they still expressed vascular smooth muscle specific markers. The arterial grafts derived from HF-MSCs demonstrated vasoreactivity in response to humoral constrictors.

Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and their transit amplifying cell (TAC) progeny sense BMPs at defined stages of the hair cycle to control their proliferation and differentiation. Here, we exploit the distinct spatial and temporal localizations of these cells to selectively ablate BMP signaling in each compartment and examine its functional role. We find that BMP signaling is required for HFSC quiescence and to promote TAC differentiation along different lineages as the hair cycle progresses. We also combine in vivo genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep-sequencing, transcriptional profiling, and loss-of-function genetics to define BMP-regulated genes. We show that some pSMAD1/5 targets, like Gata3, function specifically in TAC lineage-progression. Others, like Id1 and Id3, function in both HFSCs and TACs, but in distinct ways. Our study therefore illustrates the complex differential roles that a key signaling pathway can play in regulation of closely related stem/progenitor cells within the context of their overall niche.",

The proliferation and vitality of rHFSCs at different passages were evaluated. The cultured rHFSCs showed typical cobblestone morphology with good adhesion and colony-forming ability. Expression of keratin 15, integrin alpha6, and integrin beta1 were shown by immunocytochemistry staining. On day 1-2, the cells were in the latent phase. On day 5-6, the cells were in the logarithmic phase. Cell vitality gradually decreased from the 7th passage. Real-time PCR showed that the purified rHFSCs had good vitality and proliferative capacity and contained no keratinocytes. Highly purified rHFSCs can be obtained using tissue culture and adhesion to collagen IV. The cultured cells had good proliferative capacity and could therefore be a useful cell source for tissue-engineered hair follicles, vessels, and skin.",

    "text": "Differential expression and functionality of ATP-binding cassette transporters in the human hair follicle. BACKGROUND: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are involved in the active transport of an extremely diverse range of substrates across biological membranes. These transporters are commonly implicated in the development of multidrug resistance and are also involved in numerous physiological and homeostatic processes, including lipid transport, cell migration and differentiation. OBJECTIVES: To close the knowledge gap in the expression of ABC transporters in the human hair follicle (HF). METHODS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of ABC genes and immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of cryosections of human HFs. RESULTS: By qPCR analysis, numerous members of the ABC transporter superfamily, such as ABCB1, ABCG2 and ABCA12, were found to be transcribed in full-length human scalp HFs. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the intrafollicular protein expression of different xenobiotic ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC4, ABCG2) varies greatly, with ABCG2 expression restricted primarily to the epithelial stem cell region of the outer root sheath (bulge), whereas expression of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCC4 was more widespread. Lipid transporters ABCA1, ABCA12 and ABCA4 were almost uniformly expressed throughout the HF epithelium. Functional ABCB1/G2 activity was demonstrated by exclusion of the substrate dye, Hoechst 33342. In the bulge, this was reversed by ABCB1 and ABCG2 inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: These data encourage further investigation of ABC transporters as potentially important regulators of HF epithelial biology. Clinically, pharmacological modulation of the activity of selected intrafollicular ABC transporters may permit novel therapeutic interventions, such as protecting HF stem cells from chemotherapy-induced damage, counteracting cholesterol-associated hypertrichosis, and manipulating the intrafollicular prostaglandin balance in androgenetic alopecia.",

The reconstitution of a fully organized and functional hair follicle from dissociated cells propagated under defined tissue culture conditions is a challenge still pending in tissue engineering. The loss of hair follicles caused by injuries or pathologies such as alopecia not only affects the patients ' psychological well-being, but also endangers certain inherent functions of the skin. It is then of great interest to find different strategies aiming to regenerate or neogenerate the hair follicle under conditions proper of an adult individual. Based upon current knowledge on the epithelial and dermal cells and their interactions during the embryonic hair generation and adult hair cycling, many researchers have tried to obtain mature hair follicles using different strategies and approaches depending on the causes of hair loss. This review summarizes current advances in the different experimental strategies to regenerate or neogenerate hair follicles, with emphasis on those involving neogenesis of hair follicles in adult individuals using isolated cells and tissue engineering. Most of these experiments were performed using rodent cells, particularly from embryonic or newborn origin. However, no successful strategy to generate human hair follicles from adult cells has yet been reported. This review identifies several issues that should be considered to achieve this objective. Perhaps the most important challenge is to provide three-dimensional culture conditions mimicking the structure of living tissue. Improving culture conditions that allow the expansion of specific cells while protecting their inductive properties, as well as methods for selecting populations of epithelial stem cells, should give us the necessary tools to overcome the difficulties that constrain human hair follicle neogenesis. An analysis of patent trends shows that the number of patent applications aimed at hair follicle regeneration and neogenesis has been increasing during the last decade.

For this purpose, we developed an in vitro approach using a recently characterized reconstituted human epidermis (RHE) model engineered from hair follicle. The relevance of this skin substitute in terms of UV-induced genotoxicity was compared to ex vivo explants exposed to solar-simulated radiation (SSR). The yield of bipyrimidine photoproducts, their rate of repair, and the induction of apoptosis were very similar in both types of skin samples. In order to evaluate the protection afforded by sunscreen against DNA damage, bipyrimidine photoproducts were quantified in tissue models following SSR exposure in the presence or absence of a SPF50 + formula. A rather high DNA protection factor of approximately 20 was found in RHE, very similar to that determined for explants.

RESULTS: 4-HC inhibited human hair growth, induced premature catagen development, and inhibited proliferation and stimulated apoptosis of hair matrix keratinocytes. In addition, 4-HC increased p53 and Bax protein expression and decreased Bcl2 protein expression. Pretreatment with KRG protected against 4-HC-induced hair growth inhibition and premature catagen development. KRG also suppressed 4-HC-induced inhibition of matrix keratinocyte proliferation and stimulation of matrix keratinocyte apoptosis. Moreover, KRG restored 4-HC-induced p53 and Bax/Bcl2 expression. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results indicate that KRG may protect against 4-HC-induced premature catagen development through modulation of p53 and Bax/Bcl2 expression.",

In the present study, we investigated the effects of 3-DSC on the proliferation of human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HDPCs) and mouse hair growth in vivo. A real-time cell analyzer system, luciferase assay, Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were employed to measure the biochemical changes occurring in HDPCs in response to 3-DSC treatment. The effect of 3-DSC on hair growth in C57BL/6 mice was also examined. 3-DSC promoted the proliferation of HDPCs, similar to Tofacitinib, an inhibitor of janus-activated kinase (JAK). 3-DSC promoted phosphorylation of beta-catenin and transcriptional activation of the T-cell factor. In addition, 3-DSC potentiated interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced phosphorylation and subsequent transactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), thereby increasing the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (Cdk4), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). On the contrary, 3-DSC attenuated STAT6 mRNA expression and IL4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation in HDPCs. Finally, we observed that topical application of 3-DSC promoted the anagen phase of hair growth in C57BL/6 mice. 3-DSC stimulates hair growth possibly by inducing proliferation of follicular dermal papilla cells via modulation of WNT/beta-catenin and STAT signaling.",

Follicular unit extraction (FUE) is one of the widely practiced minimally invasive follicular harvesting techniques employed during hair transplantation. FUE technique has an advantage of utilising lower occipital area and supra-auricular region as a safe donor area described by Unger, in addition to the standard occipital donor area used in strip method (follicular unit transplant). Despite its potential advantages such as rapid recovery, minimal scarring and reduced post-operative pain ; its widespread acceptance is limited due to various factors in variable contribution like steeper learning curve and potentially higher follicular transection rates (FTRs). The main practical drawbacks in harvesting FUE from lower occipital donor region that lie inferior to the standard donor area, is its acute angle (10-15) of emergent hair from scalp skin, higher variance angle (15-35) between hairs below the skin and hair exit angle above the skin and comparatively loose scalp, preventing to provide stable platform for punching. Hair transplant surgeon faces difficulty in aligning and engaging the FUE punch leading to very high hair follicle transection rate, and therefore, it is not a preferred site for harvesting follicles in FUE. Authors description of modified technique using reverse rake scalp elevator helps in negating the acute angle of the hair follicles exit from scalp skin and reducing the variance angle between emergent hair and hair below the skin in lower occipital region thereby reducing FTR. Furthermore, an added advantage of reducing the overall operative time and surgeon fatigue, improve donor area healing, availability of a comparatively larger donor area which increases the confidence of the beginners. This method will be of help as it is easy to duplicate and follow by novice hair transplant surgeons and also for those who are routinely doing mega hair transplants sessions.",

Both TNF knockout and overexpression attenuate HF neogenesis in wounds, suggesting dose-dependent induction of HF neogenesis by TNF, which is consistent with TNF-induced AKT signalling in epidermal stem cells in vitro. TNF-induced beta-catenin accumulation is dependent on AKT but not Wnt signalling. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT blocks depilation-induced HF TAT.

We further showed that cytokines that are involved in ESC support are also expressed by cultured follicle dermal cells, providing a possible explanation for maintenance of ES cell stemness in cocultures. The same cytokines were expressed within follicles in situ in a pattern more consistent with a role in follicle growth activities than stem cell maintenance.

Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are an important source for skin tissue engineering studies and clinical applications. Here, we describe a differential enrichment approach to derive HFSCs from hair follicles of vibrissae and ear skin using the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632. In the presence of Y-27632, primary cultured hair follicle cells grew in clustered colonies surrounded by keratinocyte-like cells and simultaneously expressed three HFSC markers: CD34, K15, and ITGB1. HFSCs cultured in medium containing Y-27632 were presented at a stable ratio of 30. 7%, 34. 1%, and 32. 9% after passages 5, 10, and 15, respectively. By contrast, in medium containing epidermal growth factor, clustered HFSC colonies disappeared after 6 passages and lacked HFSC marker expression. After withdrawal of Y-27632 from the medium, HFSCs rapidly differentiated into keratinocyte-like cells. Furthermore, HFSCs derived with Y-27632 formed spherical clusters in collagen matrix in vitro, differentiated into keratinocytes and adipose cells under in vitro induction conditions, and cooperated with fetal dermal cells to regenerate hair follicles in vivo 6 weeks after their intracutaneous injection into immune-deficient mice. These findings suggest that Y-27632 maintains the self-renewal and stemness characteristics of HFSCs during primary skin tissue culture followed by enrichment passaging and that HFSCs derived with Y-27632 possess the differentiation potentials important for tissue engineering and other clinical applications.",

    "text": "Use of human intra-tissue stem/progenitor cells and induced pluripotent stem cells for hair follicle regeneration. BACKGROUND: The hair follicle (HF) is a unique miniorgan, which self-renews for a lifetime. Stem cell populations of multiple lineages reside within human HF and enable its regeneration. In addition to resident HF stem/progenitor cells (HFSPCs), the cells with similar biological properties can be induced from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). As approaches to regenerate HF by combining HF-derived cells have been established in rodents and a huge demand exists to treat hair loss diseases, attempts have been made to bioengineer human HF using HFSPCs or hiPSCs. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: The aim of this review is to comprehensively summarize the strategies to regenerate human HF using HFSPCs or hiPSCs. HF morphogenesis and regeneration are enabled by well-orchestrated epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (EMIs). In rodents, various combinations of keratinocytes with mesenchymal (dermal) cells with trichogenic capacity, which were transplanted into in vivo environment, have successfully generated HF structures. The regeneration efficiency was higher, when epithelial or dermal HFSPCs were adopted. The success in HF formation most likely depended on high receptivity to trichogenic dermal signals and/or potent hair inductive capacity of HFSPCs. In theory, the use of epithelial HFSPCs in the bulge area and dermal papilla cells, their precursor cells in the dermal sheath, or trichogenic neonatal dermal cells should elicit intense EMI sufficient for HF formation. However, technical hurdles, represented by the limitation in starting materials and the loss of intrinsic properties during in vitro expansion, hamper the stable reconstitution of human HFs with this approach. Several strategies, including the amelioration of culture condition or compartmentalization of cells to strengthen EMI, can be conceived to overcome this obstacle. Obviously, use of hiPSCs can resolve the shortage of the materials once reliable protocols to induce wanted HFSPC subsets have been developed, which is in progress. Taking advantage of their pluripotency, hiPSCs may facilitate previously unthinkable approaches to regenerate human HFs, for instance, via bioengineering of 3D integumentary organ system, which can also be applied for the treatment of other diseases. SHORT CONCLUSION: Further development of methodologies to reproduce bona fide EMI in HF formation is indispensable. However, human HFSPCs and hiPSCs hold promise as materials for human HF regeneration.",

    "text": "Evaluating hair growth promoting effects of candidate substance: A review of research methods. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common form of hair loss disorder. As the prevalence of AGA rises, the demand for AGA treatments is rising accordingly, prompting research to identify therapeutic candidates to treat AGA. Because AGA is caused by crosstalk among multiple hair follicle (HF) cell components, understanding the effects of candidate molecules on HF cells is essential to determining therapeutic candidates for treatment. To date, research has centered on HF dermal papilla and outer root sheath cells and has indicated that the hair growth effects of candidate substances may be mediated via alterations in several signaling pathways and signature genes in these HF cells. In more integrative evaluations, the HF unit is used as an ex vivo organ culture model to verify the effects of therapeutic candidates. Animal models have also been used to evaluate the effects of candidate substances. The main outcomes used to evaluate the effects of candidate substances are 1) changes in HF growth rates in vitro, 2) anagen induction capabilities, and 3) the effects of androgen modulation. This article reviews a series of methods used to evaluate the hair growth-promoting effects of candidate substances, providing an overview of cell assays, organs, and animal models used in AGA research in order to facilitate AGA research moving forward.",

The hair follicle (HF) cycle is a complicated and dynamic process in mammals, associated with various signaling pathways and gene expression patterns. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNA molecules that are not translated into proteins but are involved in the regulation of various cellular and biological processes. This study explored the relationship between ncRNAs and the HF cycle by developing a synchronization model in Angora rabbits. Transcriptome analysis was performed to investigate ncRNAs and mRNAs associated with the various stages of the HF cycle. One hundred and eleven long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 247 circular RNAs (circRNAs), 97 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 1, 168 mRNAs were differentially expressed during the three HF growth stages. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to validate the ncRNA transcriptome analysis results. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses provided information on the possible roles of ncRNAs and mRNAs during the HF cycle. In addition, lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA and circRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA networks were constructed to investigate the underlying relationships between ncRNAs and mRNAs. LNC _ 002919 and novel _ circ _ 0026326 were found to act as ceRNAs and participated in the regulation of the HF cycle as miR-320-3p sponges. This research comprehensively identified candidate regulatory ncRNAs during the HF cycle by transcriptome analysis, highlighting the possible association between ncRNAs and the regulation of hair growth. This study provides a basis for systematic further research and new insights on the regulation of the HF cycle.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21) alterations that may affect hair growth and the underlying molecular mechanisms by constructing Fgf21 global knockout (KO) mice using microinjection-mediated CRISPR/Cas9. RESULTS: Following genomic DNA sequencing, we identified 18 mice carrying Ffg21 mutations among the total 63 offspring mice obtained by injecting 340 embryos, which yielded a mutation rate of 28. 6 percent. Of these 18 mice, three had both alleles knocked out and 15 were monoallelic KO mice. Compared with the wild-type (WT) mice, the phenotypic analysis showed that the litter size of Fgf21 KO mice significantly reduced (p < 0. 05), but physiological indexes of the birth weight, gender rate, body weight (0-8 week) and body weight of adult male and female were no significant difference (p > 0. 05). Compared to WT mice, physiological anatomy indicated that the morphological characters of vital organs in Fgf21 KO mice were normal. Depilation experiments demonstrated that compared to the WT mice, the hair regrowth speed was reduced in the Fgf21 KO mice. The number of hair shafts in these mice considerably decreased, as indicated by the tissue sample analyses. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that Erk and Akt expression in the KO mice was significantly decreased (P < 0. 05), whereas western blotting demonstrated that the expression of Erk and Akt proteins and their phosphorylation levels in KO mice decreased at different rates (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Fgf21 was shown to affect hair follicle development and growth cycle, which may be associated with Pi3k/Akt and Mapk/Erk signaling pathways.",

Alopecia is a common and distressing condition, and developing new therapeutic agents to prevent hair loss is important. Human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) have been studied intensively in regenerative medicine. However, the therapeutic potential of these cells against hair loss and hair organ damage remains unclear, and the effects of hUCB-MSC transplantation on hair loss require evaluation. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of hUCB-MSCs on hair regression in vivo and restoration of anagen conduction on hair growth in vitro. The effects of hUCB-MSCs were explored in mouse catagen induction models using a topical treatment of 0. 1% dexamethasone to induce hair regression. Dexamethasone was also used to simulate a stress environment in vitro. The results demonstrated that hUCB-MSCs significantly prevented hair regression induced by dexamethasone topical stimulation in vivo. Additionally, hUCB-MSCs significantly increased the proliferation of human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and HaCaT cells, which are key constituent cells of the hair follicle. Stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and decreased expression of DKK-1 by hUCB-MSCs were also observed in hDPCs. Restoration of cell viability by hUCB-MSCs suggested that these cells exerted a protective effect on glucocorticoid stress-associated hair loss. In addition, anti-apoptotic effects and regulation of the autophagic flux recovery were observed in HaCaT cells. The results of the present study indicated that hUCB-MSCs may have the capacity to protect hair follicular dermal papilla cells and keratinocytes, thus preventing hair loss. Additionally, the protective effects of hUCB-MSCs may be resistant to dysregulation of autophagy under harmful stress.",

Hair follicle (HF) development is orchestrated by coordinated signals from adjacent epithelial and mesenchymal cells. In humans this process only occurs during embryogenesis and viable strategies to induce new HFs in adult skin are lacking. Here, we reveal that activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in adjacent epithelial and stromal cells induces new HFs in adult, unwounded dorsal mouse skin. Formation of de novo HFs recapitulated embryonic HF development, and mature follicles produced hair co-occurring with epithelial tumors. In contrast, Hh-pathway activation in epithelial or stromal cells alone resulted in tumor formation or stromal cell condensation respectively, without induction of new HFs. Provocatively, adjacent epithelial-stromal Hh-pathway activation induced de novo HFs also in hairless paw skin, divorced from confounding effects of pre-existing niche signals in haired skin. Altogether, cell-type-specific modulation of a single pathway is sufficient to reactivate embryonic programs in adult tissues, thereby inducing complex epithelial structures even without wounding.",

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) and microRNAs (miRNA) are new found classes of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are not translated into proteins but regulate various cellular and biological processes. In this study, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis of ncRNA and mRNA expression in Aohan fine wool sheep (AFWS) at different growth stages (embryonic day 90, embryonic day 120, and the day of birth), and explored their relationship with wool follicle growth. In total, 461 lncRNAs, 106 miRNAs, and 1, 009 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed during the three stages of wool follicle development. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed to clarify the roles of the differentially expressed lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA in the different stages of wool follicle development.

The combined treatment of IGF-1 and EGF enhanced the proliferation of HFs and promoted HF growth and development in vitro. In vivo, the combined treatment of IGF-1 and EGF was subcutaneously injected into the dorsal skin in HF synchronized rabbits. The IGF-1 and EGF combination promoted the transition of the hair cycle from telogen to anagen and stimulated the growth of hair shafts. This IGF-1 and EGF combination maintained the structure of the HF and enhanced the cell proliferation of outer root sheaths and the dermal papilla within rabbit skin. The combined treatment of IGF-1 and EGF regulated HF-related genes, including LEF1, CCND1 and WNT2, suggesting that IGF-1 and EGF play a positive role in HF growth and development.

In this study, we showed in a mouse model of depilation-induced hair cycling that PD-1/PD-L1 are expressed in the murine epidermis and hair follicle (HF) in a hair cycle-dependent manner. During HF morphogenesis, PD-1 expression was strongly decreased during the anagen phase compared with the catagen and telogen phases. PD-L1 expression was enhanced during the catagen phase compared with the anagen and telogen phases. Moreover, direct blockade of PD-L1 not only accelerated hair anagen phase onset but also delayed catagen progression. In conclusion, our findings indicated that PD-1/PD-L1 signaling may act as a negative regulator of hair cycle transition.

BACKGROUND: Hair follicles are among a handful of organs that exhibit immune privilege. Dysfunction of the hair follicle immune system underlies the development of inflammatory diseases, such as alopecia areata. METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and immunostaining was used to confirm the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I in human dermal papilla cells. Through transcriptomic analyses of human keratinocyte stem cells, major histocompatibility complex class I was identified as differentially expressed genes. Organ culture and patch assay were performed to assess the ability of WNT3a conditioned media to rescue immune privilege. Lastly, CD8 + T cells were detected near the hair bulb in alopecia areata patients through immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma were verified to induce the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I proteins in dermal papilla cells. Additionally, loss of immune privilege of hair follicles was rescued following treatment with conditioned media from outer root sheath cells. Transcriptomic analyses found 58 up-regulated genes and 183 down-regulated genes related in MHC class I + cells. Using newborn hair patch assay, we demonstrated that WNT3a conditioned media with epidermal growth factor can restore hair growth. In alopecia areata patients, CD8 + T cells were increased during the transition from mid-anagen to late catagen. CONCLUSION: Identification of mechanisms governing epithelial and mesenchymal interactions of the hair follicle facilitates an improved understanding of the regulation of hair follicle immune privilege.",

In accordance with the 3 Rs principle (to replace, reduce and refine) animal models in biomedical research, we have developed and applied a new approach for sampling and analyzing hair follicles in various experimental settings. This involves use of a convenient device for non-invasive collection of hair follicles and processing methods that provide sufficient amounts of biological material to replace stressful and painful biopsies. Moreover, the main components of hair follicles are live cells of epithelial origin, which are highly relevant for most types of malignant tumors, so they provide opportunities for studying aging-related pathologies including cancer. Here, we report the successful use of the method to obtain mouse hair follicular cells for genotyping, quantitative PCR, and quantitative immunofluorescence. We present proof of concept data demonstrating its utility for routine genotyping and monitoring changes in quality and expression levels of selected proteins in mice after gamma irradiation and during natural or experimentally induced aging. We also performed pilot translation of animal experiments to human hair follicles irradiated ex vivo. Our results highlight the value of hair follicles as biological material for convenient in vivo sampling and processing in both translational research and routine applications, with a broad range of ethical and logistic advantages over currently used biopsy-based approaches.",

    "text": "Environmental Regulation of Skin Pigmentation and Hair Regeneration. Skin bears essential appendages and diverse cell types that function importantly in protection, thermoregulation, mechanosensation, piloerection, and social communication. The hair follicle is a tiny skin appendage with intricate structure and has versatile functions in mammals. Hair follicles evolve stem cells that regenerate cyclically to produce hairs and to accommodate the rapidly changing environment. Sharing the same bulge niche with hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) undergo cyclic activation in synchrony with HFSCs, to pigment the hairs, which can protect the skin from ultraviolet radiation. Disorders of HFSCs or McSCs result in skin diseases such as hair loss, canities, vitiligo, and even melanoma, compromising senses of well-being and posing psychosocial distress to the affected individuals. The activation or quiescence of these stem cells is not only regulated by intrinsic factors within the follicle, but is also largely influenced by the extrinsic environmental factors, including the neighboring cells, systemic factors, and the external environment. Although great progress has been made to elucidate the intrinsic regulation of HFSCs or McSCs, understanding the environmental modulation of these stem cells can provide novel insight for the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating alopecia and skin pigmentation-related disorders.",

    "text": "CXCL12 inhibits hair growth through CXCR4. CXCL12 and its receptors, which are highly expressed in the skin, are associated with various cutaneous diseases, including androgenic alopecia. However, their expression and role during the hair cycle are unknown. This study aims to investigate the expression of CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, in the vicinity of hair follicles and their effect on hair growth. CXCL12 was highly expressed in dermal fibroblasts (DFs) and its level was elevated throughout the catagen and telogen phases of the hair cycle. CXCR4 is expressed in the dermal papilla (DP) and outer root sheath (ORS). In hair organ culture, hair loss was induced by recombinant CXCL12 therapy, which delayed the telogen-to-anagen transition and decreased hair length. In contrast, the suppression of CXCL12 using a neutralizing antibody and siRNA triggered the telogen-to-anagen transition and increased hair length in hair organ culture. Neutralization of CXCR7, one of the two receptors for CXCL12, only slightly affected hair growth. However, inhibition of CXCR4, the other receptor for CXCL12, increased hair growth to a considerable extent. In addition, in hair organ culture, the conditioned medium from DFs with CXCL12 siRNA considerably increased the hair length and induced proliferation of DP and ORS cells. CXCL12, through CXCR4 activation, increased STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in DP and ORS cells. In contrast, blocking CXCL12 and CXCR4 decreased the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5. In summary, these findings suggest that CXCL12 inhibits hair growth via the CXCR4/STAT signaling pathway and that CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway inhibitors are a promising treatment option for hair growth.",

    "text": "An extract of Leontopodium alpinum inhibits catagen development ex vivo and increases hair density in vivo. OBJECTIVES: Hair loss and reduction of hair volume are hallmarks of hair disorders, such as telogen effluvium, or male or female pattern hair loss, and hair aging, which can cause severe distress in both men and women. Common anti-hair loss drugs carry some side-effects, therefore, novel, safer approaches targeting milder phenotypes are highly advocated. In this context, we investigated an extract of the alpine plant Edelweiss, Leontopodium alpinum var. Helvetia, for its ability to modulate hair follicle (HF) growth ex vivo and inhibit hair loss while increasing hair regeneration in vivo. METHODS: Human amputated HFs were micro-dissected from three donors, two females and one male, and cultured ex vivo for 6 days. After treatment with 0. 001% Edelweiss extract (EWDE), we investigated hair shaft production, and anagen/catagen conversion, and measured known parameters associated with hair growth, i. e., hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis, dermal papilla inductivity, and growth factors, by quantitative (immuno-) histomorphometry. To assess the anti-hair loss potential of the alpine plant compound, we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled human study enrolling Caucasian women and men, aged 18 to 65 years, with normal hair loss. After five months ' daily use of an extract containing leave-on serum, we analysed hair density and anagen to catagen/telogen ratio by Trichogram analysis. RESULTS: Our results revealed a significant prolongation in the anagen phase in HFs treated with 0. 001% Edelweiss, as indicated by an increase in HFs remaining in anagen and a significant decrease in hair cycle score. In line with this effect, EWDE significantly stimulated hair matrix (HM) keratinocyte proliferation, and dermal papilla inductivity, as shown by a significant up-regulation of versican expression and alkaline phosphatase activity, and a tendential increase in FGF7 immunoreactivity in the dermal papilla of all HFs or only anagen VI HFs. Corroborating the ex vivo results, we observed a significant increase in growing hair shaft numbers (hair density) after treatment with Edelweiss extract formulation, and a tendential up-regulation in the anagen to catagen-telogen ratio. CONCLUSIONS: We show here, through several lines of evidence, that the selected extract of the alpine plant Leontopodium alpinum var Helvetia (Edelweiss) inhibits premature catagen induction, possibly by stimulating dermal papilla inductivity. It is therefore worth exploiting this extract clinically as an anti-hair loss agent, both for preventing aging-associated hair shedding and as an adjuvant therapy for hair loss disorders.",

As a part of innate immunity, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) plays an important function in most defensive responses of the organism, including but not limited to infections. Cutaneous injury, one of the most common challenges for mammals, mobilizes a number of cell types, including epithelial, immune, and vascular cells for timely tissue repair. However, in contrast to immune cells, little is known about TLR2 function on non-immune cells during skin regeneration. Here, we used two tissue-specific conditional TLR2 knockout mouse lines to address the impact of TLR2 in endothelial and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) on cutaneous wound healing. The loss of TLR2 on endothelial cells diminishes their ability to migrate, sprout, and proliferate in response to specific TLR2 ligands, and also reduces the secretion of key pro-angiogenic factors. Lack of TLR2 on endothelial cells prolongs wound healing due to diminished angiogenesis. TLR2 is expressed in key structures of hair follicle including HFSCs, secondary hair germ, and dermal papilla. Despite the prominent role for HFSCs in skin regeneration, excision of TLR2 from HFSCs has no impact on their proliferation or wound healing potential. Our study demonstrates that timely tissue regeneration after skin injury is dependent upon endothelial TLR2 for robust angiogenesis, while HFSC TLR2 is dispensable.",

BACKGROUND: Dermal fibroblasts play a pivotal role in hair follicle regeneration during wound repair. Recently, dermal fibroblast-conditioned medium (DFCM), which contains multi-peptide factors (MPFs), has been used to promote wound repair. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the stimulatory effects of MPF-containing DFCM on hair growth. METHODS: MPF-containing DFCM was prepared using human neonatal dermal fibroblasts. Outer root sheath (ORS) and dermal papilla (DP) cells were cultured in MPF-containing DFCM. We examined the expression and secretion of growth factors and cytokines using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and a growth factor array. In addition, the effect of MPFs on beta-catenin activity was determined using the TOPflash assay. All experiments were repeated at least three times with separate batches of cells. RESULTS: MPF-containing DFCM increased keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) mRNA expression in ORS cells and KGF and VEGF mRNA expression in DP cells. When ORS cells were treated with MPF-containing DFCM, the secretion of several growth factors, including EGF, VEGF, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-4, IGFBP-6, and fibroblast growth factor-7, was increased in the cell-cultured medium compared with that in control. Additionally, MPF-containing DFCM increased the transcriptional activation of beta-catenin in DP cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MPF-containing DFCM might stimulate hair growth by inducing growth factors in ORS and DP cells and regulating beta-catenin in DP cells.",

Hair follicles (HFs) achieve hair growth and renewal by periodic regeneration. Therefore, exploring the key factors affecting hair growth in rabbits is of great significance for precisely breeding Angora rabbits and improving the competitiveness of the rabbit industry. Based on the results of our previous studies, lncRNA2690 was differentially expressed in the HF cycle using lncRNA-Seq, and the full-length sequence was annotated by bioinformatics analysis. The lncRNA2690 is 363 nt long and is found on chromosome 14 from 163 321 514 to 163 321 872. The lncRNA2690 was predicted to not have the coding ability through open reading frame and CPC2, and the nuclear-cytoplasmic separation experiment showed the lncRNA2690 to be highly expressed in the nucleus (p < 0. 01). The expression pattern of lncRNA2690 was further analyzed in the different HF development stages of Angora rabbits using quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that lncRNA2690 was periodically expressed in HF development, and the expression level was found to be high in the HF resting phases. The overexpression and knockdown of lncRNA2690 were found to significantly upregulate and downregulate the expression of the genes WNT2, CCND1, BMP2, LEF1, and SIAH1 in the rabbit dermal papilla cells (p < 0. 01), promoting cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation (p < 0. 01).

BACKGROUND: Proteoglycans (PGs) are known to play key roles in many cellular signalling pathways involved in hair follicle biology. Although some PG core proteins have previously been described in adult human hair follicles, their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) moieties have been less studied. OBJECTIVES: To add knowledge about PG core protein and GAG distributions in human anagen hair follicle and, for selected follicles, during catagen. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry and immunohistofluorescence to revisit the expression pattern of GAG chains and core proteins in human hair follicle. The studied epitopes included CD44v3, syndecan-1, perlecan, versican, aggrecan, biglycan, heparan sulphate (HS), chondroitin sulphate (CS), dermatan sulphate (DS) and keratan sulphate (KS). RESULTS: The membrane PGs syndecan-1 and CD44v3 were respectively detected in the epithelial part of whole hair and in the outer root sheath basal layer. The dermal part of the hair follicle contained high amounts of extracellular PGs such as perlecan, versican, aggrecan, biglycan and their saccharidic moieties, namely HS, CS, DS and KS. We also observed a variable distribution of these components along the hair follicle. Especially, we noted a PG impoverishment at the very bottom of the anagen bulb. Moreover, while type D chondroitin expression remained unaffected, 4C3-CS and PG4-CS/DS epitopes respectively decreased in the dermal papilla and the connective tissue sheath, at the onset of catagen. CONCLUSIONS: GAG and PG expression along the human anagen hair follicle was characterized by (i) discontinuities mainly affecting the basement membrane and (ii) disappearance of some epitopes at catagen onset. These results are discussed in term of functionalities in nutrient diffusion, cell proliferation and differentiation, and hair protection.",

BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is still viewed by many dermatologists as a tumor of the interfollicular epidermis, although references were made early in the dermatopathologic literature to the resemblance of BCC to the hair follicle. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to characterize the common expression pattern for the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM) in BCCs, various stages of follicular embryogenesis, and adult hair follicles and, thereby, in analogy point to the similarity between BCC and the hair follicle. METHODS: We studied immunohistochemically 16 superficial BCCs for Ep-CAM and compared the expression pattern with that during hair follicle, nail, and eccrine gland development in human embryos and fetuses. In addition, we examined terminal scalp and vellus hair follicles. RESULTS: All BCCs expressed Ep-CAM similar to the early stages of the embryonic human hair follicle, the secondary hair germ, and the outer root sheath of the vellus hair follicle. The embryonic nail organ and the adult anagen hair follicles were completely negative. LIMITATIONS: The conclusions are based on the similarity in the immunohistochemical expression profile for a single adhesion molecule. CONCLUSION: BCC expresses the cell-cell adhesion molecule Ep-CAM similar to the embryonic hair germ, the secondary hair germ of the terminal hair follicle, and the outer root sheath of the vellus hair follicle. We suggest that this may be a clue to the adnexal nature of BCC and propose that BCC is the most primitive follicular tumor.",

    "text": "Activation of beta-catenin signaling programs embryonic epidermis to hair follicle fate. beta-Catenin signaling is required for hair follicle development, but it is unknown whether its activation is sufficient to globally program embryonic epidermis to hair follicle fate. To address this, we mutated endogenous epithelial beta-catenin to a dominant-active form in vivo. Hair follicle placodes were expanded and induced prematurely in activated beta-catenin mutant embryos, but failed to invaginate or form multilayered structures. Eventually, the entire epidermis adopted hair follicle fate, broadly expressing hair shaft keratins in place of epidermal stratification proteins. Mutant embryonic skin was precociously innervated, and displayed prenatal pigmentation, a phenomenon never observed in wild-type controls. Thus, beta-catenin signaling programs the epidermis towards placode and hair shaft fate at the expense of epidermal differentiation, and activates signals directing pigmentation and innervation. In transcript profiling experiments, we identified elevated expression of Sp5, a direct beta-catenin target and transcriptional repressor. We show that Sp5 normally localizes to hair follicle placodes and can suppress epidermal differentiation gene expression. We identified the pigmentation regulators Foxn1, Adamts20 and Kitl, and the neural guidance genes Sema4c, Sema3c, Unc5b and Unc5c, as potential mediators of the effects of beta-catenin signaling on pigmentation and innervation. Our data provide evidence for a new paradigm in which, in addition to promoting hair follicle placode and hair shaft fate, beta-catenin signaling actively suppresses epidermal differentiation and directs pigmentation and nerve fiber growth. Controlled downregulation of beta-catenin signaling is required for normal placode patterning within embryonic ectoderm, hair follicle downgrowth, and adoption of the full range of follicular fates.",

The mouse hair follicle is an easily accessible source of actively growing, pluripotent adult stem cells. C57BL transgenic mice, labeled with the fluorescent protein GFP, afforded follicle stem cells whose fate could be followed when transferred to recipient animals. These cells appear to be relatively undifferentiated since they are positive for the stem cell markers nestin and CD34 but negative for the keratinocyte marker keratin 15. These hair follicle stem cells can differentiate into neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells and melanocytes in vitro. Implanting hair follicle stem cells into the gap region of severed sciatic or tibial nerves greatly enhanced the rate of nerve regeneration and restoration of nerve function. The transplanted follicle cells transdifferentiated mostly into Schwann cells, which are known to support neuron regrowth. The treated mice regained the ability to walk essentially normally. In the present study, we severed the thoracic spinal chord of C57BL/6 immunocompetent mice and transplanted GFP-expressing hair follicle stem cells to the injury site. Most of the transplanted cells also differentiated into Schwann cells that apparently facilitated repair of the severed spinal cord. The rejoined spinal cord reestablished extensive hind-limb locomotor performance. These results suggest that hair follicle stem cells can promote the recovery of spinal cord injury. Thus, hair follicle stem cells provide an effective accessible, autologous source of stem cells for the promising treatment of peripheral nerve and spinal cord injury.",

BACKGROUND: Melanoma characteristically grows within the epidermis along the dermal-epidermal junction, sometimes extending outward up to several centimeters beyond the foci of invasive tumors. Although follicular involvement by malignant melanoma is widely recognized, to the authors ' knowledge no previously published data address this phenomenon. METHODS: To examine the growth characteristics of in situ melanomas in relation to the hair follicle microanatomy, the authors analyzed 100 cases of primary cutaneous melanomas (61 in situ and 39 invasive melanomas with significant in situ components) obtained from pathology clinical archives. RESULTS: Eighty-two (82%) cases of melanoma in situ demonstrated tumor cells within > or = 1 hair follicles. Of those, 57 (69. 5%) cases demonstrated the tumor cells only within the infundibulum. Extension of the tumor cells down to the isthmus was observed in 24 cases (29. 3%). In only 1 exceptional case (1%) were tumor cells detected beneath the level of the hair follicle bulge. CONCLUSIONS: The authors postulate that a physiologic barrier restricts the intraepithelial spread of melanoma tumor cells at or beyond the level of the stem cell niche in the hair follicle bulge. Although the nature of this barrier remains to be elucidated, the distinct biologic characteristics of the hair follicle bulge may provide clues to understanding this phenomenon.",

Notch signaling plays an important role in hair follicle maintenance, and it has been suggested that Notch is also required for follicular fate selection by adult hair follicle stem cells in the bulge. Here we demonstrate that, on the contrary, Notch signaling in bi-potential bulge stem cells or their uncommitted descendents acts to suppress the epidermal fate choice, thus ensuring follicular fate selection. To examine the role of Notch signaling in adult hair follicle stem cells, we used a Krt1-15-CrePR1 transgenic mouse line to delete Rbpj or all Notch proteins specifically in the bulge stem cells. We conclusively determined that in the absence of Notch signaling, bulge stem cell descendents retain their capacity to execute the follicular differentiation program but fail to maintain it owing to their genetic deficiency. The defect in terminal differentiation caused the diversion of Notch-deficient hair follicles to epidermal cysts, and the presence of wild-type cells could not prevent this conversion. Importantly, our analysis revealed that a functional Notch signaling pathway was required to block bulge stem cells from migrating into, and assuming the fate of, interfollicular epidermis. Taken together, our findings yield detailed insight into the function of Notch signaling in hair follicle stem cells and reveal the mechanism of the replacement of Notch-deficient adult hair follicles by epidermal cysts.",

BACKGROUND: Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a scarring disease. Although the scarring and deformity may affect any part of the body, such changes have been reported to be most obvious on the face and scalp. The pathogenesis behind this scarring process is not well understood. Once lesions have scarred, recurrent disease tends to occur at the edge of the scarred lesions but not within them. OBJECTIVES: The fact that inflammation in DLE generally involves the bulge area of the follicles raises the possibility that damage to the stem cells of the bulge region may be one process leading to the permanent loss of follicles. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the hair follicle stem cells which reside in the bulge region in the scarring process in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). METHODS: We studied the reactivity of an antibody to the CD8 antigen (C8/144B), which recognizes cytokeratin (CK) 15 and preferentially immunostains hair follicle stem cells without staining the remaining hair follicle, on skin biopsies (scalp and body lesions) from patients with CLE (36 with discoid lesions and 10 with subacute lesions). Normal scalp and body biopsy specimens served as controls. The correlation between the extent of the cytotoxic inflammatory cell infiltrate (CD8 +) and the presence of stem cells was investigated. Results were analysed semiquantitatively. RESULTS: The expression of CK15 in hair follicle stem cells was variable in the DLE lesions ; there was normal to moderate CK15 expression at the bulge region of hair follicles when surrounded by mild or moderate inflammatory infiltrate (CD8 +), but in cases of severe inflammation, CK15 expression was weak or absent. CONCLUSIONS: The bulge region appears to be involved in this disease as part of a broader involvement of the hair follicles ; it is secondarily affected by the surrounding inflammatory cell infiltrate. Expression of C8/144B diminished and was then absent, indicating either damage to stem cells or differentiation to help in the repair process. Damage to follicular stem cells may help to explain the irreversible alopecia and the scarring process which characterize this disease.",

SGK3, which previously has been shown to play a key role in hair follicle development in mice, is a member of the AGC family of serine-threonine kinases. Mice lacking SGK3 have abnormal follicle cycling, which begins shortly after birth and ameliorates substantially with age. However, this developmental abnormality is not recapitulated in mice lacking closely related kinases Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3. To examine whether Akt2 interacts with SGK3 in postnatal hair development, we have generated and characterized Akt2/SGK3 double knockouts (DKOs). We find that the DKO mice have a defect in hair growth that is markedly worse than that of SGK3 (-/-) mice and does not ameliorate with age. Morphologically, this defect is characterized by accelerated entry into catagen and through anagen, irregular hair follicle orientation, and increased expression of sebaceous glands. The defect is preceded by a profound failure to increase follicle matrix cell nuclear beta-catenin accumulation and proliferation at the onset of morphogenesis. Furthermore, in cultured keratinocytes, transfected Akt2 and SGK3 both stimulate transcription of a beta-catenin-LEF1-dependent reporter gene. Thus, SGK3 and Akt2 both appear to play important roles in postnatal hair follicle morphogenesis, likely because of their redundant regulation of beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional processes, which control hair follicle cell proliferation.",

Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB signaling mechanisms provide central controls in development and disease, but how these pathways intersect is unclear. Using hair follicle induction as a model system, we show that patterning of dermal Wnt/beta-catenin signaling requires epithelial beta-catenin activity. We find that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is absolutely required for NF-kappaB activation, and that Edar is a direct Wnt target gene. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is initially activated independently of EDA/EDAR/NF-kappaB activity in primary hair follicle primordia. However, Eda/Edar/NF-kappaB signaling is required to refine the pattern of Wnt/beta-catenin activity, and to maintain this activity at later stages of placode development. We show that maintenance of localized expression of Wnt10b and Wnt10a requires NF-kappaB signaling, providing a molecular explanation for the latter observation, and identify Wnt10b as a direct NF-kappaB target.

During the morphogenesis of hair follicles, the invasive migration of basal keratinocytes resembles cell ' s dissemination of tissue remodeling. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) appears to be a key molecule in the metastasis. In order to elucidate the relationship between uPAR and the invasion of the human hair follicle, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, plasmids transfection, and western blot were used. The results showed that uPAR was expressed in the outermost epithelial cells of the hair follicle and the basal keratinocytes of epidermis, and that the expression decreased with the development of the hair follicle. The cells of the outer root sheath (ORS) and interfollicle epidermis, which overexpressed uPAR, acquired increased invasiveness ; however, they showed decreased invasion with overexpression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator amino terminal fragment (uPA ATF), which inhibited the combination of uPAR and uPA competitively, and the cell invasive migration with overexpressed uPAR was required activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK). These results implied that overexpression of uPAR promote the invasive migration of hair follicle into the dermis in uPA-dependent and independent manner during human prenatal development.",

The delayed anagen onset correlated with an increased expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21CIP, and increased activity of the TGFbeta pathway, a known inducer of p21CIP expression. Primary N-WASP-null keratinocytes showed reduced growth compared with control cells and enhanced expression of the gene encoding the cell-cycle inhibitor p15INK4B, a TGFbeta target gene. Inhibition of TGFbeta signaling blocked overexpression of p15INK4B and restored proliferation of N-WASP-deficient keratinocytes in vitro. However, induction of N-WASP gene deletion in vitro did not result in obvious changes in TGFbeta signaling or growth of keratinocytes, indicating that the in vivo environment is required for the phenotype development.

BACKGROUND: The hair follicle of mammalian skin consists of a group of concentric epithelial cell layers. The inner root sheath (IRS), which surrounds the hardening hair shaft beneath the skin surface, is subdivided into three layers, termed the cuticle of the IRS, Huxley ' s layer, and Henle ' s layer. The IRS forms a follicular wall in the hair canal and helps guide the developing hair shaft. c-Maf and MafB, members of the Maf family of transcription factors, play important roles in the developmental processes of various tissues and in cell type-specific gene expression. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to reveal the pattern of expression and functional roles of c-Maf and MafB in the hair follicle. METHODS: We determined the precise location of c-Maf and MafB expression using immunofluorescent staining of mouse skin sections with layer-specific markers. We also analyzed whiskers of c-maf-and mafB-null mice (c-maf (-/-) and mafB (-/-), respectively) using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: c-Maf and MafB were differentially expressed in the Huxley ' s and Henle ' s layers of the IRS. Scanning electron microscopic analysis showed irregular cuticle patterning of whiskers of c-maf (-/-) and mafB (-/-) mice. The cuticles of mafB (-/-) mice were also thinner than those of wild-type mice. CONCLUSION: c-Maf and MafB are expressed in the IRS layers in a lineage-restricted manner and are involved in hair morphogenesis.",

BACKGROUND: There are different stem cell pools located in the hair follicle. OBJECTIVE: To try to determine whether follicular units can survive a partial extraction and whether this partial extracted follicular unit can regenerate new hairs. METHODS: From five individuals, between 100 and 150 grafts were harvested from the occipital area of the scalp. Suitable grafts were implanted into the recipient area. Hair growth and characteristics in the donor area and the recipient area were observed at different intervals. RESULTS: After 3 months, between 92. 1% and 104. 1% (mean 97. 7%) of the partial follicular units in the donor sites survived and produced hairs with the same characteristics. After 1 year, 91. 1-101. 7% (mean 95. 9%) of the implanted partial follicular units regenerated hair growth with the same characteristics as the hairs in the donor area. CONCLUSIONS: We revealed that extracted partial longitudinal follicular units transplanted to the recipient area can be used as complete follicular units to regenerate completely differentiated hair growth with the same characteristics as in the donor area. We also revealed that the partial follicular units in the donor area can survive and produce the same number of hairs with the same characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown that hair follicle bugle cells can differentiate into hair follicles and contribute to the formation of the epidermis and sebaceous gland. Although many lines of evidence have suggested that the renewal and maintenance of the sebaceous gland depends on hair follicle bulge cells, direct evidence supporting the in vitro differentiation of follicle bulge cells into sebaceous gland cells has not been found. METHODS: Rat vibrissa follicle bulge cells were isolated, cultured, and transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFPC1) plasmids carrying the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 (PPARgamma2) gene. The transfected cells were cultured in modified medium, and the morphologic changes of the cells were observed. Moreover, the expression of epithelial membrane antigens (EMAs) by the cells was detected by immunocytochemistry, and adipogenesis of the cells was evaluated. RESULTS: After induction culture, the cell body enlarged gradually and contained abundant cytoplasm ; lipid droplets appeared in the cytoplasm of some cells, and the cells resembled sebocytes of the sebaceous gland. The cells were positive on oil red O and EMA staining. The expression of PPARgamma2 mRNA and protein was significantly upregulated in PPARgamma2-transfected cells. The rate of oil red O-stained and EMA-positive cells was higher in PPARgamma2-transfected cells after induction than in bulge-PPARgamma2 cells and non-transfected bulge cells. CONCLUSIONS: Rat vibrissa hair follicle bulge cells may differentiate into sebocytes in vitro, and the PPARgamma2 gene plays a crucial role.",

Here we report a convenient, reliable, and less invasive method for detecting human clock gene expression using biopsy samples of hair follicle cells from the head or chin. We show that the circadian phase of clock gene expression in hair follicle cells accurately reflects that of individual behavioral rhythms, demonstrating that this strategy is appropriate for evaluating the human peripheral circadian clock. Furthermore, using this method, we indicate that rotating shift workers suffer from a serious time lag between circadian gene expression rhythms and lifestyle. Qualitative evaluation of clock gene expression in hair follicle cells, therefore, may be an effective approach for studying the human circadian clock in the clinical setting.",

These become the primary SCs for the next hair cycle, whereas initial bulge SCs become reserves for injury. Proliferating descendents further en route irreversibly lose their stemness, although they retain many SC markers and survive, unlike their transit-amplifying progeny. Remarkably, these progeny also home back to the bulge. Combining purification and gene expression analysis with differential ablation and functional experiments, we define critical functions for these non-SC niche residents and unveil the intriguing concept that an irreversibly committed cell in an SC lineage can become an essential contributor to the niche microenvironment.",

The purpose of this study was to identify the retro-modulator released by DPCs exposed to sub-toxic dose of colchicine and elucidate its effect on dermal papilla culture. The molecular-weight cutoff ultrafiltration and HPLC were used to purify the components of colchicine-treated DPC secretomes and examined their ability to down-regulate the growth and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of DPCs. The active product was identified by in-gel trypsin digestion, nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS and validated by Western blot to be histone H4 (P62804), which inhibited the proliferation and diminished the ALP activity of cultured DPCs. Treating DPCs with recombinant histone H4 reproduced the growth inhibition effect whereas adding antibody to immunoneutralize histone H4 abolished this growth inhibitory consequence. DPCs with high ALP activity can induce the neogenesis of hair follicles and support the hair fiber growth in vivo. Our results indicated that sub-lethal colchicine can inactivate DPCs through releasing histone H4.

OBJECTIVES: Multipotential human hair follicle stem cells can differentiate into various cell lineages and thus are investigated here as potential autologous sources for regenerative medicine. Towards this end, we have attempted to expand these cells, directly isolated from minimal amounts of hair follicle explants, to numbers more suitable for stem-cell therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two types of human follicle stem cells, commercially available and directly isolated, were cultured using an in-house developed medium. The latter was obtained from bulge areas of hair follicles by mechanical and enzymatic dissociation, and was magnetically enriched for its CD200 (+) fraction. Isolated cells were cultured for up to 4 weeks, on different supports: blank polystyrene, laminin-and Matrigel (TM)-coated surfaces. RESULTS: Two-fold expansion was found, highlighting the slow-cycling nature of these cells. Flow cytometry characterization revealed: magnetic enrichment increased the proportion of CD200 (+) cells from initially 43. 3% (CD200 +, CD34: 25. 8% ; CD200 +, CD34 +: 17. 5%) to 78. 2% (CD200 +, CD34: 41. 5% ; CD200 +, CD34 +: 36. 7%).

BACKGROUND: To visualise and characterise skin architecture, the tissue usually has to be destroyed and labelled. OBJECTIVES: The use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy as a label-free, minimally sample destructive method to define hair follicular structure has been explored and demonstrated in this paper. METHODS: Human scalp skin cryosections were imaged using FTIR microscopy and the data was subsequently analysed with N-FINDR spectral unmixing algorithm. RESULTS: This resulted in an excellent distinction of known hair follicle tissue layers, which could be discerned based on their molecular structure. CONCLUSION: The development of a minimally sample-destructive, label-free spectroscopy based technique that can differentiate layers of cells in the dermal papilla and connective tissue sheath in the mesenchyme of the hair follicle paves the way forward to identifying spectral markers important in wound healing and stem cell therapies.",

The Lhx2 transcription factor plays essential roles in morphogenesis and patterning of ectodermal derivatives as well as in controlling stem cell activity. Here, we show that during murine skin morphogenesis, Lhx2 is expressed in the hair follicle (HF) buds, whereas in postnatal telogen HFs Lhx2 (+) cells reside in the stem cell-enriched epithelial compartments (bulge, secondary hair germ) and co-express selected stem cell markers (Sox9, Tcf4 and Lgr5). Remarkably, Lhx2 (+) cells represent the vast majority of cells in the bulge and secondary hair germ that proliferate in response to skin injury. This is functionally important, as wound re-epithelization is significantly retarded in heterozygous Lhx2 knockout (+/-) mice, whereas anagen onset in the HFs located closely to the wound is accelerated compared with wild-type mice. Cell proliferation in the bulge and the number of Sox9 (+) and Tcf4 (+) cells in the HFs closely adjacent to the wound in Lhx2 (+/-) mice are decreased in comparison with wild-type controls, whereas expression of Lgr5 and cell proliferation in the secondary hair germ are increased. Furthermore, acceleration of wound-induced anagen development in Lhx2 (+/-) mice is inhibited by administration of Lgr5 siRNA. Finally, Chip-on-chip/ChIP-qPCR and reporter assay analyses identified Sox9, Tcf4 and Lgr5 as direct Lhx2 targets in keratinocytes. These data strongly suggest that Lhx2 positively regulates Sox9 and Tcf4 in the bulge cells, and promotes wound re-epithelization, whereas it simultaneously negatively regulates Lgr5 in the secondary hair germ and inhibits HF cycling. Thus, Lhx2 operates as an important regulator of epithelial stem cell activity in the skin response to injury.",

Hair follicle harbors a rich stem cell pool with mesenchymal lineage differentiation potential. Although previous studies with rodent cells demonstrated that hair follicle sheath and papilla cells possess multi-lineage differentiation potential, human hair follicle derived mesenchymal stem cells (hHF-MSCs) have not been characterized in detail in terms of their multipotency. In addition, it is not clear whether these cells are true stem cells that can differentiate along multiple lineages or whether they represent a collection of progenitor cells with restricted differentiation potential. Here we report that hHF-MSCs are highly proliferative cells that can be maintained in culture for ~ 45 population doublings before they start to show signs of cellular senescence. Under appropriate culture conditions, hHF-MSCs differentiated along the myogenic, osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, as demonstrated by kinetic gene expression profiling and functional assays. Interestingly, the differentiation potential decreased with time in culture in a lineage-specific manner. Specifically, myogenesis and chondrogenesis showed a moderate decrease over time ; osteogenesis was maximum at intermediate passages and adipogenesis was highly sensitive to long-term culture and was diminished at late passages. Finally, hHF-MSCs were clonally multipotent as the majority of hHF-MSCs clones (73%) demonstrated bi-or tri-lineage differentiation potential. These results suggest that hHF-MSCs may present as an alternative source of easily accessible, autologous stem cells for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

INTRODUCTION: Human hair follicle outer root sheath (hORS) cells are known to contain hair follicle stem cells and play an important role in healing large size wounds, and thus can serve as the cell source for skin engineering. This study investigated the effect of low oxygen tension culture on hORS cell proliferation potential and functional maintenance during in vitro expansion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spared postsurgery scalp tissues were donated by 15 patients aged 20-45 (13 men and 2 women) and were randomly divided into three groups, and isolated hORS cells were combined into three pooled cell samples. They were cultured either in 4% O (2) or 21% O (2) and were analyzed for cell proliferation, colony forming efficiency (CFE), and their ability in forming engineered skin in vitro. RESULTS: The results showed that freshly isolated hORS cells expressed CD200 (22. 88 +-8. 76), cytokeratin 15 (CK15) (62. 57 +-4. 72), CD29 (22. 53 +-2. 49/strong and 29. 80 +-4. 09/dim), and CD49f (28. 07 +-15. 76/strong and 49. 73 +-5. 65/dim). When exposed in 4% O (2), hORS cells proliferated significantly faster than the cells in 21% O (2) for the first three passages (p < 0. 05), could better maintain cobblestone morphology, respectively, generate 3. 63-folds more and 23. 26-folds more cell yields after one and three passages. Additionally, enhanced CFE with significantly higher total and holoclone colony numbers were found in the 4% O (2) group than in the 21% O (2) group (p < 0. 05) for the first three passages along with better maintained CK15 expression. Furthermore, hORS cells expanded in 4% O (2) could form better epidermal structure of in vitro engineered skin comparing to the skin engineered by the control cells. CONCLUSION: The low oxygen culture method of hORS cells is simple, low cost, less labor intensive, and less biosafety concern, which may potentially be applied in skin engineering and clinical application.",

Recent studies on follicular permeation emphasise the importance of hair follicles as diffusion pathways, but only a limited amount of data are available about the follicular permeation of topically applied drugs. This study examines the use of a hair follicle closure technique in vitro, to determine the participation of hair follicles in transdermal drug penetration. Various substances, with different lipophilicities, were tested: caffeine, diclofenac, flufenamic acid, ibuprofen, paracetamol, salicylic acid and testosterone. Diffusion experiments were conducted with porcine skin, the most common replacement material for human skin, in Franz-type diffusion cells over 28 hours. Different experimental settings allowed the differentiation between interfollicular and follicular permeation after topical application of the test compounds. A comparison of the apparent permeability coefficients of the drugs demonstrates that the percutaneous permeations of caffeine and flufenamic acid were significantly higher along the hair follicles. In the cases of paracetamol and testosterone, the follicular pathway appears to be of importance, while no difference was found between interfollicular and follicular permeation for diclofenac, ibuprofen and salicylic acid. Thus, the hair follicle closure technique represents an adequate in vitro method for gaining information about follicular or percutaneous permeation, and can replace in vivo testing in animals or humans.",

However, most of previous investigations adopted rodent bulge cells. The biological properties of human and rodent bulge cells have been reported to be distinct. Accordingly, it is crucial to directly isolate and characterize human bulge cells. However, the supply of human hair follicles for investigative purposes may be extremely limited in some situation. Dogs share analogous hair loss disorders with humans. Recent investigations have uncovered the biological similarities between canine bulge cells, suggesting that canine bulge cells are valuable substitute for the biological characterization of human bulge cells. Here, we provided the protocols for the isolation and characterization of human and canine hair follicle stem cell-enriched keratinocytes. Manual microdissection still represents the most commonly used technique to enrich bulge cells from human and canine hair follicles. Positive selection using a cell surface marker, CD200, should enable further enrichment of human bulge cells. Confirmation of successful isolation and molecular and cellular biological characterization of bulge cells are possible by real-time PCR and flow cytometry analyses described here. Colony-forming assay enables not only the evaluation of in vitro proliferative capacity but also the subcloning of holoclone keratinocytes, putative keratinocyte stem cells.

Epidermal keratinocytes and hair follicle (HF) stem cells (SCs) expressing oncogenes are competent at developing squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) in epidermis and HFs, respectively. To determine whether bulge and hair germ (HG) SCs from HF contribute to SCC generation at distant epidermis, the most frequent epidermal region where these lesions arise in human skin, we used a skin cancer mouse model expressing E6 and E7 oncoproteins from Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 in SCs and basal keratinocytes. This previously described mouse model recapitulates the human skin papillomavirus-induced SCC pathology. We show that E6 and E7 expression promote the expansion of keratin 15 (K15)-expressing cells. These K15 (+) aberrant cells exhibit some HGSC markers and diminished expression of Tcf3 and Sox9 hair SC specification genes, which are accumulated in HFs and mislocalized to interfollicular epidermis. Leucine-rich G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)-expressing SCs, localized in the bulge and HG, are the origin of the expanded K15 (+) cell population. A large subset of the Lgr5 (+) SC progeny, expressing K15 and P-cadherin, is aberrantly mobilized to the upper region of HFs and the epidermis, and accumulates at E6/E7-induced pre-neoplastic lesions and epidermal tumors. These findings indicate that aberrant accumulation of altered SCs in HFs and their subsequent migration to the epidermis contribute to HPV-induced tumor development.",

Here we analyzed differential gene expressions between pigmented, gray, and white human scalp skin hair follicles (HFs) from identical donors. Forming intersections between five donors identified 194/192 downregulated and 186/177 upregulated genes in gray/white HFs.

Intriguingly, among them, genes associated with energy metabolism (i. e., glutaminase) and axon guidance (plexin C1) were altered. These results were reflected by pathway analysis and exemplarily confirmed by PCR and immunohistochemical studies. Supplementing cultured HFs with glutamine or plexin C1 revealed biological relevance and pharmacointerventional potential of these microarray results in altering the HF aging process.

    "text": "Targeted disruption of glutathione peroxidase 4 in mouse skin epithelial cells impairs postnatal hair follicle morphogenesis that is partially rescued through inhibition of COX-2. Selenoproteins are essential molecules for the mammalian antioxidant network. We previously demonstrated that targeted loss of all selenoproteins in mouse epidermis disrupted skin and hair development, and caused premature death. In the current study, we targeted specific selenoproteins for epidermal deletion to determine whether similar phenotypes developed. Keratinocyte-specific knockout mice lacking either the glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) or thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR1) gene were generated by cre-lox technology using K14-cre. TR1 knockout mice had a normal phenotype in resting skin, whereas GPx4 loss in the epidermis caused epidermal hyperplasia, dermal inflammatory infiltrate, dysmorphic hair follicles, and alopecia in perinatal mice. Unlike epidermal ablation of all selenoproteins, mice ablated for GPx4 recovered after 5 weeks and had a normal life span. GPx1 and TR1 were upregulated in the skin and keratinocytes of GPx4-knockout mice. GPx4 deletion reduces keratinocyte adhesion in culture and increases lipid peroxidation and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels in cultured keratinocytes and whole skin. Feeding a COX-2 inhibitor to nursing mothers partially prevents development of the abnormal skin phenotype in knockout pups. These data link the activity of cutaneous GPx4 to the regulation of COX-2 and hair follicle morphogenesis, and provide insight into the function of individual selenoprotein activity in maintaining cutaneous homeostasis.",

Mechanisms of tissue stem cell (SC) quiescence control are important for normal homeostasis and for preventing cancer.

We document CDKis expression in vivo during hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) homeostasis and find p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a, Cdkn1a), p57, and p15 up-regulated at quiescence onset. p21 appears important for HFSC timely onset of quiescence. Conversely, we find that Runx1 (runt related transcription factor 1), which is known for promoting HFSC proliferation, represses p21, p27, p57, and p15 transcription in HFSC in vivo. Intriguingly, in cell culture, tumors, and normal homeostasis, Runx1 and p21 interplay modulates proliferation in opposing directions under the different conditions. Unexpectedly, Runx1 and p21 synergistically limit the extent of HFSC quiescence in vivo, which antagonizes the role of p21 as a cell cycle inhibitor. Importantly, we find in cultured keratinocytes that Runx1 and p21 bind to the p15 promoter and synergistically repress p15 mRNA transcription, thereby restraining cell cycle arrest. This documents a surprising ability of a CDKi (p21) to act as a direct transcriptional repressor of another CDKi (p15).

Non-cultured dissociated neonatal murine-only skin cells, or cultured human-only skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts without dermal papilla cells served as positive and negative controls respectively. In this study, neonatal murine-only skin substitutes formed external hairs and sebaceous glands, chimeric skin substitutes formed pigmented hairs without sebaceous glands, and human-only skin substitutes formed no follicles or glands. Although chimeric hair cannot erupt readily, removal of upper skin layer exposed keratinized hair shafts at the skin surface. Development of incomplete pilosebaceous units in chimeric hair corresponded with upregulation of hair-related genes, LEF1 and WNT10B, and downregulation of a marker of sebaceous glands, Steroyl-CoA desaturase.

The immune privilege (IP) of hair follicles (HFs) has been well established in previous studies. However, whether cultured HF cells still exhibit IP properties, the individual factors involved in this process, and the detailed mechanisms that drive and maintain IP, are largely unidentified. We found preferential expression of IP-associated genes in cultured HF dermal papilla and dermal sheath cup cells (DSCCs) compared with non-follicular fibroblasts (FBs) at passage 4, suggesting a potential for functional IP. Notably, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) was significantly upregulated in DSCCs and dermal papilla cells relative to FBs. IFNgamma secretion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) co-cultured with histoincompatible DSCCs was significantly lower than with FB and higher percentages of early apoptotic, Annexin V + cells were observed in PBMC co-cultured with DSCCs. Knockdown of PD-L1 translation by silencing interfering RNA in DSCCs enabled increased IFNgamma secretion by PBMCs, whereas transfection of pCMV6-XL4/hPD-L1 in FB significantly reduced IFNgamma secretion and increased apoptosis in co-cultured PBMCs. We also found that apoptosis in allogeneic T cells induced by DSCCs was largely dependent on the mitochondrial pathway.

The K5:: miR-24 animals display a marked defect in HF morphogenesis, with thinning of hair coat and altered HF structure. Expression of miR-24 alters the normal process of hair keratinocyte differentiation, leading to altered expression of differentiation markers.

OBJECTIVE: Skin appendages including hair follicles (hfs) and the stratum corneum (sc) are beginning to be recognized as important permeation pathways for the skin permeation of drugs, but their detailed role is not yet clear. To investigate the contribution of hfs to drug permeation, we conducted skin permeation tests by controlling the hf contribution with a hf-plugging method. METHOD: Lidocaine (LC) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 kDa (FD-4) were selected as model drugs and pig ear skin was used as model skin. RESULTS: Skin permeabilities of ionized LC and FD-4 decreased with hf-plugging, whereas no change was observed for the skin permeation of unionized LC. A fairly good correlation was found for ionized LC and FD-4 between skin permeability and the number of hfs plugged. Permeation parameters of model drugs for both skin pathways were calculated utilizing Fick ' s second law of diffusion. Consequently, the sc pathway could highly contribute to the permeation of unionized LC, since unionized LC shows markedly high partition to the sc. In contrast, the hf pathway could contribute to the permeation of ionized LC and FD-4, since these had high distributions to the hf pathway in spite of its very small surface area relative to whole skin surface area. CONCLUSION: The hf pathway must be important for the skin permeation of ionized compounds and hydrophilic high molecular compounds. hf-plugging is also a useful method for assessing the skin permeability of compounds through the hf pathway.",

    "text": "Comparison of high-intensity ultraviolet and NB-UVB on the maturation of melanocytes derived from hair follicle neural crest stem cells. Both high-intensity ultraviolet and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) are important therapeutic options for vitiligo management, but high-intensity ultraviolet is more effective than NB-UVB. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been well investigated. Herein, we compare the effects of high-intensity ultraviolet and NB-UVB on the pigmentation of melanocytes derived from hair follicle-derived neural crest stem cells (HF-NCSCs) in vitro and study the underlying mechanisms. The HF-NCSCs were isolated from mouse whisker follicles. After radiation with high-intensity ultraviolet and NB-UVB, respectively, the cell viability by the CCK-8 assay showed gradual inhibitory effects in a dose-dependent manner, which has no apparent difference between the two modalities. The mRNA for melanogenesis factors such as tyrosinase and tyrp1 of the differentiated melanocytes increased significantly with high-intensity ultraviolet compared to the same dose of NB-UVB exposure. Furthermore, the expression of Mc1r was significantly increased by high-intensity ultraviolet in contrast to NB-UVB at the dosage of 0. 5 J. By and large, these data suggest that high-intensity ultraviolet exhibited greater efficiency on the maturation of the melanocyte lineage differentiated from HF-NCSCs compared to NB-UVB with the same dose, which was probably due to the stronger stimulatory action of Mc1r. This may provide new insights into the different efficacies of high-intensity ultraviolet and NB-UVB in the treatment of vitiligo repigmentation.",

OBJECTIVE: To obtain rat hair follicle stem cells (rHFSCs) which can constantly and highly express vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165), and to observe the expression of VEGF165 gene in rat HFSCs. METHODS: The cirri skin of 1-week-old Sprague Dawley rat was harvested and digested by using combination of Dispase and type IV collagenases. The bulge was isolated under microscope. The rHFSCs were cultured by tissue block method. After purified by rapid adhering on collagen type IV, the growth curve of different generations rHFSCs was drawn. The cells were identified by immunofluorescence staining and real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis that tested the expression level of correlated genes. Lentivirus of pLV-internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-VEGF165-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (experimental group) and pLV-IRES-EGFP empty vector (control group) was packaged by calcium transfected method and the rHFSCs were transfected. The green fluorescent protein expression was observed by inverted fluorescence microscope, and VEGF165 mRNA and protein expressions were detected using RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: The rHFSCs which were isolated, cultured, and purified were like the \" \" slabstone \" \", and had strong adhesion ability and colony formation ability. The purified cells were in latent growth phase at 2-3 days ; they were in exponential growth phase at 5-6 days. The expressions of cytokeration 15 (CK15), integrin alpha6, and integrin beta1 (markers of HFSCs) were positive by immunocytochemistry. The RT-qPCR analysis showed that CK15, CK19, integrin alpha6, and integrin beta1 expressed highly, but CD34 (a marker of epidermal stem cells) and CK10 (a marker of keratinocyte) expressed lowly. After 14 days, the transfection efficiency was up to 85. 76% +/-1. 91%. RT-PCR analysis and Western blot showed that VEGF165 mRNA and protein expressions were positive in experimental group, and were negative in control group. CONCLUSION: The rHFSCs with high purity and strong proliferation ability can be obtained by using microscope combined with tissue cultivation and rapid cell adhesion on collagen type IV. The rHFSCs with high expression of VEGF165 can be successfully obtained by lentiviral transfection. This method provides good seeding cells for tissue engineering to construct artificial hair follicles, blood vessels, and skins. \"",

Hair follicles are readily accessible and serve as a rich source of autologous stem cells for cell-based gene therapy. Here we isolated mesenchymal stem cells from human hair follicles (HF-MSCs) and engineered them to overexpress the human insulin gene and release human insulin in a time-and dose-dependent manner in response to rapamycin. The engineered HF-MSCs retained their characteristic cell surface markers and retained their potential to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts. When mice with streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes were engrafted with these engineered HF-MSCs, these cells expressed and released a dose of human insulin, dramatically reversed hyperglycemia, and significantly reduced death rate. Moreover, the engineered HF-MSCs did not form detectable tumors throughout the 120-day animal tests in our experiment. Our results show that HF-MSCs can be used to safely and efficiently express therapeutic transgenes and therefore show promise for cell-based gene therapy of human disease.",

The Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency and partial reprogramming of stem cells. Postnatal neural crest cells (NCCs) can differentiate into odontoblast-like cells due to their multi-potential property, but further endeavors need to be made to promote odontogenic differentiation of hair follicle neural crest cells (hfNCCs). This study investigated whether the Wnt pathway activator lithium chloride (LiCl) promotes odontoblast differentiation of hfNCCs. Change of proliferation, beta-catenin and pluripotency markers of hfNCCs were examined after treatment with LiCl. An in vitro odontoblast differentiation model of hfNCCs was built using dental cell conditioned media (DC-CM). The effects of LiCl on odontoblast differentiation of hfNCCs showed that proliferation and expression of beta-catenin in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments were increased in the LiCl-treated hfNCCs, and the pluripotency marks, Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and Nanog, were more highly expressed in the LiCl-treated group than in the control group. The odontoblast markers such as DSP, DMP1 and Runx2, could be detected in hfNCCs induced by DC-CM, but in LiCl-treated group all three markers had stronger expression. Expression of beta-catenin in the nuclear of LiCl-treated hfNCCs induced by DC-CM was higher than in the other groups. The data indicate that the Wnt pathway activator LiCl can promote proliferation and odontoblast differentiation of hfNCCs, and chemical approaches are of benefit in obtaining more desirable seed cell types for cell-based therapies.",

Hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis relies on the coordinated exchange of signals between mesenchymal and epithelial compartments of embryonic skin. Chemokine receptor Cxcr4 expression was recently identified in dermal condensates (DCs) of nascent HFs, but its role in promoting HF morphogenesis remains unknown. Our analyses confirmed Cxcr4 expression in condensate cells, and additionally revealed transient Cxcr4 expression in incipient epithelial hair placodes. Placodal Cxcr4 appeared prior to detection in DCs, representing a switch of expression between epithelial and mesenchymal compartments. To explore the functional role of this receptor in both compartments for early HF formation, we conditionally ablated Cxcr4 with condensate-targeting Tbx18 (cre) knock-in and epidermis-targeting Krt14-cre transgenic mice. Conditional knockouts for both crosses were viable throughout embryogenesis and into adulthood. Morphological and biochemical marker analyses revealed comparable numbers of HFs forming in knockout embryos compared to wild-type littermate controls in both cases, suggesting that neither dermal nor epithelial Cxcr4 expression is required for early HF morphogenesis. We conclude that Cxcr4 expression and chemokine signaling through this receptor in embryonic mouse skin is dispensable for HF formation.",

Emerging studies of treating spinal cord injury (SCI) with adult stem cells led us to evaluate the effects of transplantation of hair follicle stem cells in rats with a compression-induced spinal cord lesion. Here, we proposed a hypothesis that rat hair follicle stem cell transplantation can promote the recovery of injured spinal cord. Compression-induced spinal cord injury was induced in Wistar rats in this study. The bulge area of the rat vibrissa follicles was isolated, cultivated and characterized with nestin as a stem cell marker. 5-Bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeled bulge stem cells were transplanted into rats with spinal cord injury. Immunohistochemical staining results showed that some of the grafted cells could survive and differentiate into oligodendrocytes (receptor-interacting protein positive cells) and neuronal-like cells (betaIII-tubulin positive cells) at 3 weeks after transplantation. In addition, recovery of hind limb locomotor function in spinal cord injury rats at 8 weeks following cell transplantation was assessed using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale. The results demonstrate that the grafted hair follicle stem cells can survive for a long time period in vivo and differentiate into neuronal-and glial-like cells.

Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent dermatological disease of the pilosebaceous unit (PSU). An inability to target drug delivery to the PSU results in poor treatment efficacy and the incidence of local side-effects. Cutaneous application of nanoparticulate systems is reported to induce preferential accumulation in appendageal structures. The aim of this work was to prepare stable polymeric micelles containing retinoic acid (RA) using a biodegradable and biocompatible diblock methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (hexylsubstituted lactic acid) copolymer (MPEG-dihexPLA) and to evaluate their ability to deliver RA to skin. An innovative punch biopsy sample preparation method was developed to selectively quantify follicular delivery ; the amounts of RA present were compared to those in bulk skin, (i. e. without PSU), which served as the control. RA was successfully incorporated into micelle nanocarriers and protected from photoisomerization by inclusion of Quinoline Yellow. Incorporation into the spherical, homogeneous and nanometer-scale micelles (dn < 20 nm) increased the aqueous solubility of RA by > 400-fold. Drug delivery experiments in vitro showed that micelles were able to deliver RA to porcine and human skins more efficiently than Retin-A () Micro (0. 04%), a marketed gel containing RA loaded microspheres, (7. 1 +-1. 1% vs. 0. 4 +-0. 1% and 7. 5 +-0. 8% vs. 0. 8 +-0. 1% of the applied dose, respectively). In contrast to a non-colloidal RA solution, Effederm () (0. 05%), both the RA loaded MPEG-dihexPLA polymeric micelles (0. 005%) and Retin-A () Micro (0. 04%) displayed selectivity for delivery to the PSU with 2-fold higher delivery to PSU containing samples than to control samples. Moreover, the micelle formulation outperformed Retin-A () Micro in terms of delivery efficiency to PSU presenting human skin (10. 4 +-3. 2% vs. 0. 6 +-0. 2%, respectively). The results indicate that the polymeric micelle formulation enabled an increased and targeted delivery of RA to the PSU, potentially translating to a safer and more efficient clinical management of acne.",

Growth and regeneration of one tissue within an organ compels accommodative changes in the surrounding tissues. However, the molecular nature and operating logic governing these concurrent changes remain poorly defined. The dermal adipose layer expands concomitantly with hair follicle downgrowth, providing a paradigm for studying coordinated changes of surrounding lineages with a regenerating tissue. Here, we discover that hair follicle transit-amplifying cells (HF-TACs) play an essential role in orchestrating dermal adipogenesis through secreting Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). Depletion of Shh from HF-TACs abrogates both dermal adipogenesis and hair follicle growth. Using cell type-specific deletion of Smo, a gene required in SHH-receiving cells, we found that SHH does not act on hair follicles, adipocytes, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic cells for adipogenesis. Instead, SHH acts directly on adipocyte precursors, promoting their proliferation and their expression of a key adipogenic gene, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparg), to induce dermal adipogenesis. Our study therefore uncovers a critical role for TACs in orchestrating the generation of both their own progeny and a neighboring lineage to achieve concomitant tissue production across lineages.",

CXXC5 was upregulated in miniaturized hair follicles and arrector pili muscles in human balding scalps. The inhibitory effects of CXXC5 on alkaline phosphatase activity and cell proliferation were demonstrated using human hair follicle dermal papilla cells. Moreover, CXXC5-/-mice displayed accelerated hair regrowth, and treatment with valproic acid, a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitor that activates the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, further induced hair regrowth in the CXXC5-/-mice.

    "text": "The walking dead: sequential nuclear and organelle destruction during hair development. BACKGROUND: Transition of hair shaft keratinocytes from actively respiring, nucleated cells to structural cells devoid of nucleus and cytoplasm is key to hair production. This form of cell ' death ', or cornification, requires cellular organelle removal to allow the cytoplasm to become packed with keratin filament bundles that further require cross-linking to create a strong hair fibre. Although these processes are well described in epidermal keratinocytes, there is a lack of understanding of such mechanisms, specifically in the hair follicle. OBJECTIVES: To gain insights into cornification mechanisms within the hair follicle and thus improve our understanding of normal hair physiology. METHODS: Scalp biopsies and hair-pluck samples were obtained from healthy human donors and analysed microscopically after immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: A focal point of respiratory activity was evident in keratogenous zone cells within the hair shaft, which also exhibited nuclear damage. Nuclear degradation occurred via both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. Conversely, mitophagy was driven by Bnip3L and restricted to the boundary of the keratogenous zone at Adamson ' s Fringe. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a model of stepwise living-dead transition within the first 1 mm of hair formation, whereby fully functional, nucleated cells first consolidate required functions by degrading nuclear DNA, yet continue to respire and provide the source of reactive oxygen species required for keratin cross-linking. Finally, as the cells become packed with keratin bundles, Bnip3L expression triggers mitophagy to rid the cells of the last remaining ' living ' characteristic, thus completing the march from ' living ' to ' dead ' within the hair follicle.",

Human scalp skin with abundant hair follicles in various stages of the hair growth cycle was histocultured for up to 40 days on Gelfoam at the air/liquid interface. The anagen hair follicles within the histoculture scalp skin produced growing hair shafts. Hair follicles could continue their cycle in histoculture ; for example, apparent spontaneous catagen induction was observed both histologically and by the actual regression of the hair follicle. In addition, vellus follicles were shown to be viable at day 40 after initiation of culture. Follicle keratinocytes continued to incorporate [3H] thymidine for up to several weeks after shaft elongation had ceased. Intensive hair growth was observed in the pieces of shaved mouse skin histocultured on Gelfoam. Isolated human and mouse hair follicles also produced growing hair shafts. By day 63 in histoculture of mouse hair follicles, the number of hair follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells increased significantly and the follicles were intact. Gelfoam histoculture of skin demonstrated that the hair follicle cells are the most sensitive to doxorubicin which prevented hair growth, thereby mimicking chemotherapy-induced alopecia in Gelfoam histoculture.",

The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin and provides a protective barrier against environmental insults. It is a rapidly-renewing tissue undergoing constant regeneration, maintained by several types of stem cells. The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is one of the fundamental signaling pathways that contributes to epidermal development, homeostasis, and repair, as well as to hair follicle development and follicle bulge stem cell maintenance. The HH pathway interacts with other signal transduction pathways, including those activated by Wnt, bone morphogenetic protein, platelet-derived growth factor, Notch, and ectodysplasin. Furthermore, aberrant activation of HH signaling is associated with various tumors, including basal cell carcinoma. Therefore, an understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of the HH signaling pathway is important for elucidating fundamental mechanisms underlying both organogenesis and carcinogenesis. In this review, we discuss the role of the HH signaling pathway in the development and homeostasis epidermis and hair follicles, and in basal cell carcinoma formation, providing an update of current knowledge in this field.",

Hair plays a large part in communication and society with its role changing through time and across cultures. Most people do not leave the house before combing their hair or shaving their beard and for many hair loss or irregular hair growth can have a significant impact on their psychological health. Somewhat unsurprisingly, according to GMR Data, today ' s global hair care industry is worth an estimated $ 87 Billion, with hair loss estimated at $ 2. 8 Billion. Considering that no current hair loss-related products can completely reverse hair loss, it is reasonable to believe this market could expand significantly with the discovery of a comprehensive therapy. As such, a great deal of research focuses on overcoming hair loss, and in particular, a common form of hair loss known as androgenetic alopecia (AGA) or male pattern baldness. In AGA, hair follicles miniaturise in a large step change from a terminal to a vellus state. Within this viewpoint article, we discuss how influx and efflux of cells into and out from the dermal papilla (DP) can modulate DP size during the hair cycle. As DP size is positively correlated with the size of the hair fibre produced by a follicle, we argue here that therapies for treating AGA should be developed which can alter DP size, rather than just promote hair growth. We also discuss current therapeutics for AGA and emphasise the importance of using the right model systems to analyse miniaturisation.",

The functional aspect of scalp hair is not only to protect from solar radiation and heat/cold exposure but also to contribute to one ' s appearance and personality. Progressive hair loss has a cosmetic and social impact. Hair undergoes three stages of hair cycle: the anagen, catagen, and telogen phases. Through cyclical loss and new-hair growth, the number of hairs remains relatively constant. A variety of factors, such as hormones, nutritional status, and exposure to radiations, environmental toxicants, and medications, may affect hair growth. Androgens are the most important of these factors that cause androgenic alopecia. Other forms of hair loss include immunogenic hair loss, that is, alopecia areata. Although a number of therapies, such as finasteride and minoxidil, are approved medications, and a few others (e. g., tofacitinib) are in progress, a wide variety of structurally diverse classes of phytochemicals, including those present in ginseng, have demonstrated hair growth-promoting effects in a large number of preclinical studies.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to observe hair follicle (HF) development in the dorsal skin and elucidate the expression patterns of genes and proteins related to skin and HF development in Rex rabbits from birth to 8 weeks of age. METHODS: Whole-skin samples were obtained from the backs of Rex rabbits at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age, the morphological development of primary and secondary HFs was observed, and the gene transcript levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), epidermal growth factor (EGF), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), transforming growth factor beta-1, 2, and 3 (TGFbeta-1, TGFbeta-2, and TGFbeta-3) were examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Additionally, Wnt family member 10b (Wnt10b) and beta-Catenin gene and protein expression were examined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. RESULTS: The results showed significant changes in the differentiation of primary and secondary HFs in Rex rabbits during their first 8 weeks of life. The IGF-I, EGF, TGFbeta-2, and TGFbeta-3 transcript levels in the rabbits were significantly lower at 2 weeks of age than at birth and gradually increased thereafter, while the BMP2 and TGFbeta-1 transcript levels at 2 weeks of age were significantly higher than those at birth and gradually decreased thereafter. beta-Catenin gene expression was also significantly affected by age, while the Wnt10b transcript level was not. However, the Wnt10b and beta-catenin protein expression levels were the lowest at 2 and 4 weeks of age. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that a series of changes in HFs in dorsal skin occurred during the first 8 weeks. Many genes, such as IGF-I, EGF, BMP2, TGFbeta-1, TGFbeta-2, TGFbeta-3, and beta-Catenin, participated in this process, and the related proteins Wnt10b and beta-Catenin in skin were also affected by age.",

Several journal reports, reviews, and commentaries over the last 20-25 years have pointed out the controversy attached to 17beta-estradiol ' s inhibitory or stimulatory influence on hair follicle growth/cycling citing rodent (murine) and human results. While 17beta-estradiol is the most potent sex steroid hormone in the body and has almost equal affinity for estrogen receptor (ER) alpha (alpha) and beta (beta), there appears to be specific ER-mediated effects on scalp hair follicles/growth, etc. Additionally, the newly discovered G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPR30 or GPER) and the orphan receptor, estrogen-related receptor (ERR) gamma (gamma), in skin and other tissue sites have potential impacts of how estrogens via these receptors may alter scalp hair characteristics, but this remains to be elucidated. Conversely, the negative impact of the 5alpha-reductase enzyme and its steroid product, 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone, on scalp hair growth is clear. Less clear is how 17beta-estradiol is stimulatory in some scalp hair studies, but inhibitory in others. This brief summary examines the potential influences of steroidogenesis via aromatase (estrogen biosynthesis) and 5alpha-reductase expression, their enzyme activities, and steroid products along with the concepts of how steroid acute regulatory protein (StAR) and estrone sulfate may be involved in the complex hormonal, cellular/molecular signaling cascade of the hair follicle in growth and cycling.",

By using an ex vivo organ culture of vibrissae follicles, conditional Meis1 loss causes retardation in hair growth, accompanied by defects in cell proliferation of hair matrix cells. This cell proliferation defect is partly rescued by the addition of culture supernatants derived from Meis1-sufficient but not-deficient DP cells.

Trichocytes are completely extruded via HS shedding during exogen, an actively controlled process. This underappreciated functional property of the human hair follicle (HF) makes it a bona fide excretory (mini-) organ. Here, we ask whether the ca. 2 million HFs of the human integument operate in part as primitive, spatially dispersed kidney-like excretory organs.

We explain how the many open questions (eg, how are molecules destined to be excreted by hair shaft entrapment recognized, taken up and deposited into hair matrix cells ?) can be tested experimentally. Finally, we explore how the therapeutic targeting of kidney-like excretory HF functions may usefully complement classical nephrological therapy (dialysis) and ask whether stimulation of intrafollicular erythropoietin synthesis might become exploitable for the benefit of patients with renal anaemia. \"",

PURPOSE: Although androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a common cause of hair loss, little is known regarding the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the AGA or scalp. This study aimed to analyze whether MRI for hair and scalp (MRH) can evaluate anatomical changes in the scalp caused by AGA. METHODS: Twenty-seven volunteers were graded for the severity of AGA using the Hamilton-Norwood Scale (HNS), commonly used classification system. All subjects underwent MRH ; two radiologists independently analyzed the images. As a quantitative measurement, the number of hair follicles was analyzed and compared with the HNS. As a qualitative analysis, each MRH scan was visually graded in terms of the severity of alopecia, using a 4-point MR severity score. The scores were compared with the HNS. RESULTS: The volunteers were divided into two groups of 12 and 15 males without and with AGA at their vertex, respectively. Inter-observer agreements for the hair count and the MR severity score were excellent. The mean hair count on MRI in the normal group was significantly higher than that in the AGA group (P < 10-4). The MR severity score in the AGA group was significantly more severe than that in the control group (P < 10-4). In terms of the presence or absence of thinning hair, the MR severity score was consistent with the HNS determined by a plastic surgeon in 96% of cases. MR severity scores of clinically moderate AGA cases were significantly lower than those of severe cases (P = 0. 022). CONCLUSION: MRH could depict scalp anatomy showing a clear difference between AGA and normal scalps, in both hair count and subjective visual assessment. The MR severity score was in good agreement with the clinical stages by HNS. The results support the potential of MRH as a promising imaging technique for analyzing healthy and pathological scalps.",

RESULTS: The survival rates of follicles with intact and non-intact hair bulbs were 60. 00% and 50. 62%, respectively. The average diameters of hair shafts and repigmentation of the two groups were 92. 83 +-7. 26 microm vs 55. 86 +-2. 64 microm (p <. 05), 2. 62 +-0. 13 mm vs 2. 63 +-0. 17 mm (p >. 05), respectively. CONCLUSION: Single follicle transplantation was an alternative effective choice for the treatment of vitiligo. The skin implanted with follicle with non-intact hair bulb was less hairy.",

    "text": "Expression Profiling and Functional Characterization of miR-26a and miR-130a in Regulating Zhongwei Goat Hair Development via the TGF-beta/SMAD Pathway. The Zhongwei goat is an important and unique goat breed indigenous to China. It has a natural hair curling phenotype at birth, but the degree of curling gradually decreases with growth. The molecular mechanism underlying the dynamic changes in the wool curvature in Zhongwei goats is poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in many biological processes, including hair growth and development. In this study, we selected skins from Zhongwei goats at different ages (45 and 108 days) that exhibited different levels of hair curvature and performed miRNA sequencing to explore the molecular mechanism of hair bending. In total, 28 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were identified in the three groups of samples between the two developmental stages. An analysis of the target genes of the above-mentioned DE miRNAs by the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses indicated that the DE miRNAs were involved in signal pathways which were previously associated with hair bending and hair follicle development, such as the TGF-beta/SMAD, PI3K-Akt, JAK-STAT, and MAPK pathways. A comprehensive analysis of the correlations between the miRNA-seq results and issued transcriptional findings indicated that SMAD1 was a target gene of miR-26a and SMAD5 was a target gene of miR-130a. Furthermore, goat dermal papilla cells were successfully isolated and purified to determine the role of miRNAs in follicle development in vitro. The study results demonstrated that miR-130a and miR-26a had significant effects on the proliferation of dermal papilla cells. In addition, the detection results of mRNA and protein levels indicate that the overexpression of miR-26a can promote the expression of related genes in the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway, while miR-130a has the opposite substitution effect. The dual luciferase report test showed that miR-26a targeted the SMAD1 gene and reduced the expression of the SMAD1 protein in hair papillary cells. Our results identified DE microRNAs which perhaps change at the time of hair straightening in Zhongwei goats and explore the role of miR-26a and miR-130a in dermal papilla cells proliferation. The present study provided a theoretical basis to explore the mechanisms underlying the Zhongwei hair growth and curly phenotype.",

Here, we show that 453 nm blue light induces cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) accumulation in human keratinocytes and the hair follicle. CRY1 is prominently expressed in the human anagen hair follicle, including epithelial stem cells. Specific silencing of CRY1 promotes catagen, while stimulation of CRY1 by KL001 prolongs anagen ex vivo by altering the expression of genes involved in apoptosis and proliferation. Together, our study identifies a role for CRY1 in sustaining human hair growth. Previously, we demonstrated positive effects of 453 nm blue light on hair growth ex vivo.

The hair follicle (HF) is an important mini-organ of the skin, composed of many types of cells. Dermal papilla cells are important signalling components that guide the proliferation, upward migration and differentiation of HF stem cell progenitor cells to form other types of HF cells. Thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4), a major actin-sequestering protein, is involved in various cellular responses and has recently been shown to play key roles in HF growth and development. Endogenous Tbeta4 can activate the mouse HF cycle transition and affect HF growth and development by promoting the migration and differentiation of HF stem cells and their progeny. In addition, exogenous Tbeta4 increases the rate of hair growth in mice and promotes cashmere production by increasing the number of secondary HFs (hair follicles) in cashmere goats. However, the molecular mechanisms through which Tbeta4 promotes HF growth and development have rarely been reported. Herein, we review the functions and mechanisms of Tbeta4 in HF growth and development and describe the endogenous and exogenous actions of Tbeta4 in HFs to provide insights into the roles of Tbeta4 in HF growth and development.",

We show that DPS express HF inductivity markers, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), versican and noggin, while plucked HSs retain substantial remnants of the anagen hair matrix. When cultured together, DPS adhere to and surround the plucked HS (HS-DPS), and significantly enhance HS expression of the differentiation marker keratin-85 (K85 ; p < 0. 0001), while simultaneously decreasing the percentage of TUNEL + cells in the proximal HS (p = 0. 0508).

Mesenchymal stem cell therapy (MSCT) has been shown to be a new therapeutic option for treating alopecia areata (AA). Outer root sheath cells (ORSCs) play key roles in maintaining the hair follicle structure and supporting the bulge area. In human ORSCs (hORSCs), the mechanism for this process has not been extensively studied. In this study, we aimed to examine the influence of human hematopoietic mesenchymal stem cells (hHMSCs) in the hORSCs in vitro model of AA and determine the mechanisms controlling efficacy. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) pretreatment was used to induce an in vitro model of AA in hORSCs. The effect of MSCT on the viability and migration of hORSCs was examined using co-cultures, the MTT assay, and migration assays. We investigated the expression of molecules related to the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, JAK/STAT pathway, and growth factors in hHMSC-treated hORSCs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analyses. hHMSCs increased hORSC viability and migration when they were co-cultured. hHMSCs reverted IFN-gamma-induced expression-including NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, CXCL-9 through 11, IL-1beta, and IL-15-and upregulated several growth factors and hair stem cell markers. hHMSCs activated several molecules in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, such as in the Wnt families, beta-catenin, phosphorylated GSK-3beta and cyclin D1, and suppressed the expression of DKK1 induced by IFN-gamma in hORSCs. hHMSCs suppressed the phosphorylation of JAK1 to 3, STAT1, and STAT3 compared to the controls and IFN-gamma-pretreated hORSCs. These results demonstrate that hHMSCs increased hORSC viability and migration in the in vitro AA model. Additionally, MSCT definitely stimulated anagen survival and hair growth in an HF organ culture model. MSCT appeared to be associated with the Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK/STAT pathways in hORSCs.",

Dermal papillae are a target of androgen action in patients with androgenic alopecia, where androgen acts on the epidermis of hair follicles in a paracrine manner. To mimic the complexity of the dermal papilla microenvironment, a better culture model of human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) is needed. Therefore, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated two-dimensional (2D)-and 3D-cultured DPCs on hair follicle growth. 2D-and 3D-cultured DPC proliferation was inhibited after co-culturing with outer root sheath (ORS) cells under DHT treatment. Moreover, gene expression levels of beta-catenin and neural cell adhesion molecules were significantly decreased and those of cleaved caspase-3 significantly increased in 2D-and 3D-cultured DPCs with increasing DHT concentrations. ORS cell proliferation also significantly increased after co-culturing in the control-3D model compared with the control-2D model. Ki67 downregulation and cleaved caspase-3 upregulation in DHT-treated 2D and 3D groups significantly inhibited ORS cell proliferation. Sequencing showed an increase in the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix synthesis in the 3D model group. Additionally, the top 10 hub genes were identified, and the expression of nine chemokine-related genes in DHT-treated DPCs was found to be significantly increased. We also identified the interactions between transcription factor (TF) genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) with hub genes and the TF-miRNA coregulatory network. Overall, the findings indicate that 3D-cultured DPCs are more representative of in vivo conditions than 2D-cultured DPCs and contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying androgen-induced alopecia.",

However, the mechanisms responsible for its effects are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of PBM on hair regeneration in injured skin and to explore the underlying mechanisms. The scratched epidermis or dermis models were established in C57 mice aged 7-8 weeks. We found that the scratched epidermis had no influence on hair regeneration, but the scratched dermis led to obvious hair follicle atrophy and significantly influenced hair regeneration. The wounds in scratched dermis models were treated with PBM (655 nm, 3 J/cm2 [10 min]) and the hair regeneration and cell proliferation in hair follicle were evaluated. Compared with control, the hair coverage level was significantly enhanced after PBM treatment. Sox9 + and PCNA + cells in hair follicle were obviously observed in PBM-treated group, but not in control. In vitro, the effects of PBM on the function of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) were investigated. The results showed that the migration of DPCs was increased significantly by PBM (655 nm, 3 J/cm2 [10 min]), whereas no effect was found on proliferation. Furthermore, we found that PBM promoted exosome secretion of DPCs, accompanied by the activation of Akt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin pathway. AKT inhibitor MK-2206 effectively blocked PBM-induced migration and exosome secretion of DPCs. These findings suggest that the enhanced migration and exosome secretion of DPCs mediated by the Akt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin pathway were responsible for the promotion of hair regeneration in injured skin by PBM.",

Stem cell proliferation and differentiation must be carefully balanced to support tissue maintenance and growth.

An emerging hypothesis from observations in both mouse and human holds that imbalances in key stem cell regulatory pathways such as Wnt signaling may lead to abnormal fate determination of these Lrig1 + ve cells. They accumulate and form cystic structures in the JZ that are similar to the comedones found in human acne. To test the possible involvement of Wnt signals in this scenario, we used the Lrig1-CreERT2 mouse line to modulate Wnt signaling in JZ stem cells. We observed that persistent activation of Wnt signaling leads to JZ cyst formation with associated SG atrophy. The cysts strongly express stem cell markers and can be partially reduced by all-trans retinoic acid treatment as well as by Hedgehog signaling inhibition. Conversely, loss of Wnt signaling leads to enlargement of JZ, infundibulum and SGs. These data implicate abnormal Wnt signaling in the generation of mouse pathologies that resemble human acne and respond to acne treatments.",

We discover that proper micro-injury effectively induces hair regeneration by activating the hair follicle stem cell proliferation and migration downwards to the hair matrix, finally shifting the hair follicle stage from telogen into anagen. On vitiligo model mice, micro-injury also induces the hair follicle melanocyte stem cells to migrate upwards to the interfollicular epidermis, activating and giving rise to melanocytes to repopulate the vitiligo lesion. Mechanistic analysis indicates that the canonical Wnt/-catenin pathway plays a key role in the micro-injury-induced repair process. The present study demonstrates that micro-injury has great potential in inducing hair regeneration and vitiligo repigmentation, laid a foundation to develop a micro-injury-based treatment method in alopecia and vitiligo.",

    "text": "Depilatory laser miniaturizes hair by inducing bystander dermal papilla cell necrosis through thermal diffusion. OBJECTIVES: Depilatory laser targeting melanin has been widely applied for the treatment of hypertrichosis. Both selective photothermolysis and thermal diffusion have been proposed for its effect, but the exact mechanism of permanent hair reduction remains unclear. In this study, we explore the role of thermal diffusion in depilatory laser-induced permanent hair loss and determine whether nonpigmented cells are injured by thermal diffusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6 mice in anagen and telogen were treated with alexandrite laser (wavelength 755 nm, pulse duration 3 milliseconds, fluence 12 J/cm2, spot size 12 mm), respectively. Histological analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and transmission electron microscopic imaging were employed to evaluate the injury to hair follicle (HF) cells. The proliferation status of HF cells was examined by 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine pulse labeling. The number of HF stem cells was quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The size of the regenerated hair was determined by measuring its length and width. RESULTS: We found that irradiating C57BL/6 mice in anagen with alexandrite laser led to hair miniaturization in the next anagen. In addition to thermal disruption of melanin-containing cells in the precortex region, we also detected necrosis of the adjacent nonpigmented dermal papilla cells due to thermal diffusion. Dermal papilla cells decreased by 24% after laser injury, while the number of bulge stem cells remained unchanged. When the laser was delivered to telogen HFs where no melanin was present adjacent to the dermal papilla, thermal necrosis and cell reduction were not detected in the dermal papilla and no hair miniaturization was observed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that depilatory laser miniaturizes hair by inducing thermal necrosis of dermal papilla cells due to secondary thermal diffusion from melanin-containing precortex cells in the anagen hair bulbs.",

Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are implicated in the formation of hair follicles and epidermis. This study aims to clarify the role of SMAD2 in regulating the differentiation of HFSCs, which is involved with Smurf2. Functional assays were carried out in human HFSCs to assess the effect of SMAD2 and Smurf2 with altered expression on growth dynamics of HFSCs. Ubiquitination of SMAD2 and its protein stability were assessed. The binding relationship between NANOG and DNMT1 was assessed. A mouse skin wound model was induced to verify the effects of Smurf2/SMAD2/NANOG/DNMT1 on wound healing. SMAD2 overexpression was observed in HFSCs during differentiation and its ectopic expression contributed to promotion of differentiation and apoptosis of HFSCs while arresting cell proliferation. Mechanistic investigations indicated that Smurf2 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of SMAD2, thus causing downregulation of SMAD2 expression. By this mechanism, NANOG expression was reduced and the subsequent DNMT1 transcriptional expression was also diminished, leading to suppression of differentiation and apoptosis of HFSCs while stimulating cell proliferation. Moreover, in vivo data showed that Smurf2 upregulation limited epidermal wound healing in mice by inhibiting the SMAD2/NANOG/DNMT1 axis. Our work proposed a potential target regarding SMAD2 restoration in promoting HFSC differentiation and skin wound healing.",

Dermal papilla cells (DPCs), which play a central role in the regulation of hair follicle development and hair growth, are among the most promising cell sources for hair regenerative medicine. However, a critical issue in the use of DPCs is the immediate loss of hair inducing functions in typical two-dimensional (2D) culture. We have previously demonstrated that when DPCs are encapsulated in drops of collagen gel (named hair beads, HBs), the density of collagen and cells is concentrated > 10-fold during 3 d of culture through the spontaneous constriction of the drops, leading to efficient hair follicle regeneration upon transplantation. However, the mechanisms responsible for the activation of the hair-inducing functions of DPCs have been poorly elucidated. Here, transcriptome comparisons of human DPCs in HB culture and in typical 2D culture revealed that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Akt (PI3K/Akt) signaling pathway was significantly upregulated in HB culture. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway decreased the hair-inducing capability of DPCs in HBs, while the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway using an activator improved trichogenous gene expression of DPCs in 2D culture. These results suggest that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is crucial for the maintenance and restoration of hair inductivity of DPCs. HB culture and/or activators of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway could be a promising strategy for preparing DPCs for hair regenerative medicine.",

Background: 3D organoid cultures of hair follicles (HFs) are powerful models that mimic native HF for both in-depth study of HF disease and precision therapy. However, few studies have investigated the complete structure and properties of HF organoids. To investigate and characterize the complete HF organoids self-assembled by coculture of neonatal mouse epidermal cells (MECs) and dermal cells in Matrigel. Methods: Fresh epidermal and dermal cells from newborn mice (n = 4) were isolated, and cocultured (1: 1 ratio) in Matrigel using DMEM/F12 medium for 1 week. During the culture, an inverted microscope was used to observe the morphology of the 3D constructs. After 1 week, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining of HF-related markers (K5, K73, AE13, and K10), HF stem cell markers (K15, CD34, CD49f), skin-derived precursor-related marker (Nestin), and dermal papillae (DP)-specific markers (SOX2 and ALP) was performed in the harvested constructs to identify the HF organoids. Results: Epidermal and dermal cells self-assembled into HF organoids comprising an infundibular cyst-like structure, a lower segment-like structure, and a bulb-like structure from tail to root. The HF organoid had multiple, well-defined compartments similar to native anagen HF. Of the three segments, K73 was expressed in the inner root sheath-like layer, AE13 was localized in the hair shaft-like structure, K5, K15, CD34, and CD49f were present in the outer root sheath-like layer, Nestin labeled the connective tissue sheath-like layer, and SOX2 and ALP were expressed in the DP-like structure. Furthermore, K10 and K73 were expressed in the infundibular cyst-like structure. The expression of these molecular proteins was consistent with native anagen HF. Conclusions: The complete HF organoid regenerated in Matrigel has specific compartments and is an excellent model to study HF disease and precision therapy.",

The critical requirement for cutaneous expression of the VDR has been proven by investigations in mice and humans lacking functional receptors. These studies demonstrate that absence of the VDR leads to the development of alopecia. The hair follicle is formed by reciprocal interactions between an epidermal placode, which gives rise to the hair follicle keratinocytes and the underlying mesoderm which gives rise to the dermal papilla. Hair follicle morphogenesis ends the second week of life in mice. Studies in VDR null mice have failed to demonstrate a cutaneous abnormality during this period of hair follicle morphogenesis. However, VDR null mice are unable to initiate a new hair cycle after the period of morphogenesis is complete, therefore, do not grow new hair. Investigations in transgenic mice have demonstrated that restricted expression of the VDR to keratinocytes is capable of preventing alopecia in the VDR null mice, thus demonstrating that the epidermal component of the hair follicle requires VDR expression to maintain normal hair follicle homeostasis. Studies were then performed to determine which regions of the VDR were required for these actions. Investigations in mice lacking the first zinc finger of the VDR have demonstrated that they express a truncated receptor containing an intact ligand binding and AF2 domain. These mice are a phenocopy of mice lacking the VDR, thus demonstrate the critical requirement of the DNA binding domain for hair follicle homeostasis. Transgenic mice expressing VDRs with mutations in either the ligand-binding domain or the AF2 domain were generated. These investigations demonstrated that mutant VDRs incapable of ligand-dependent transactivation were able to prevent alopecia. Investigations are currently underway to define the mechanism by which the unliganded VDR maintains hair follicle homeostasis.",

The mammalian hair follicle is a complex ' mini-organ ' thought to form only during development ; loss of an adult follicle is considered permanent. However, the possibility that hair follicles develop de novo following wounding was raised in studies on rabbits, mice and even humans fifty years ago. Subsequently, these observations were generally discounted because definitive evidence for follicular neogenesis was not presented. Here we show that, after wounding, hair follicles form de novo in genetically normal adult mice. The regenerated hair follicles establish a stem cell population, express known molecular markers of follicle differentiation, produce a hair shaft and progress through all stages of the hair follicle cycle. Lineage analysis demonstrated that the nascent follicles arise from epithelial cells outside of the hair follicle stem cell niche, suggesting that epidermal cells in the wound assume a hair follicle stem cell phenotype. Inhibition of Wnt signalling after re-epithelialization completely abrogates this wounding-induced folliculogenesis, whereas overexpression of Wnt ligand in the epidermis increases the number of regenerated hair follicles. These remarkable regenerative capabilities of the adult support the notion that wounding induces an embryonic phenotype in skin, and that this provides a window for manipulation of hair follicle neogenesis by Wnt proteins. These findings suggest treatments for wounds, hair loss and other degenerative skin disorders.",

Integrins are transmembrane adhesion proteins that convey critical topobiological information and exert crucial signalling functions. In skin and hair follicle biology, beta1 integrins and their ligands are of particular interest. It is not yet known whether beta1 integrins play any role in the regulation of human hair growth and the expression pattern of beta1 integrin in the human pilosebaceous unit remains ill-defined. Here, we show that pilosebaceous immunoreactivity for beta1 integrin is most prominent in the outermost layer of the outer root sheath and the surrounding connective tissue sheath of human scalp hair follicles in situ and in vitro. Sites of beta1 integrin immunoreactivity co-express fibronectin and tenascin-C. Contrary to previous reports, beta1 integrin immunoreactivity in situ was not significantly upregulated in the human bulge region. Functionally, two beta1 integrin-activating antibodies (12G10, TS2/16) and ligand-mimicking RGD peptides promoted the growth of microdissected, organ-cultured human scalp hair follicles in vitro and inhibited spontaneous hair follicle regression. This supports the concept that beta1 integrin-mediated signalling is also important in human hair growth control. The physiologically relevant organ culture assay employed here is a potential research tool for exploring whether targeted stimulation of beta1 integrin-mediated signalling is a suitable candidate for human hair loss management.",

P-cadherin is a member of the classical cadherin family that forms the transmembrane core of adherens junctions. Recently, mutations in the P-cadherin gene (CDH3) have been shown to cause two inherited diseases in humans: hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD) and ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome). The common features of both diseases are sparse hair and macular dystrophy of the retina, while only EEM syndrome shows the additional finding of split hand/foot malformation (SHFM). We identified five consanguineous Pakistani families with either HJMD or EEM syndrome, and detected pathogenic mutations in the CDH3 gene of all five families. In order to define the role of P-cadherin in hair follicle and limb development, we performed expression studies on P-cadherin in the mouse embryo, and demonstrated the predominant expression of P-cadherin not only in the hair follicle placode, but also at the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb bud. Based on the evidence that mutations in the p63 gene also result in hypotrichosis and SHFM, and that the expression patterns of p63 and P-cadherin overlap in the hair follicle placode and AER, we postulated that CDH3 could be a direct transcriptional target gene of p63. We performed promoter assays and ChIP, which revealed that p63 directly interacts with two distinct regions of the CDH3 promoter. We conclude that P-cadherin is a newly defined transcriptional target gene of p63, with a crucial role in hair follicle morphogenesis as well as the AER during limb bud outgrowth in humans, whereas it is not required for either in mice.",

Here, we have investigated the role of Runx1 in mouse hair follicle stem cells by conditional ablation in epithelial cells.

Adult mutant mice exhibit impaired de novo production of hair shafts and all temporary hair cell lineages, owing to a prolonged quiescent phase of the first hair cycle.

AIMS: We hypothesized that hair-follicle stem cells can differentiate toward smooth contractile muscle cells, providing an autologous cell source for cardiovascular tissue regeneration. METHODS AND RESULTS: Smooth muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs) were obtained from ovine hair follicles using a tissue-specific promoter and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Hair-follicle smooth muscle progenitor cells (HF-SMPCs) expressed several markers of vascular smooth muscle including alpha-actin, calponin, myosin heavy chain (MHC), caldesmon, smoothelin, and SM22. HF-SMPCs were highly proliferative and showed high clonogenic potential without any signs of chromosomal abnormalities as evidenced by karyotype analysis. HF-SMPCs compacted fibrin hydrogels to a similar extent as vascular smooth muscle cells from ovine umbilical veins (V-SMCs), indicating the development of the force-generating machinery. In addition, cylindrical tissue equivalents prepared with HF-SMPCs displayed significant contractility in response to vasoactive agonists including KCl and the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619, suggesting that these cells had developed receptor and non-receptor-mediated pathways of contractility. Finally, transforming growth factor-beta1 promoted differentiation of HF-SMPCs toward a mature SMC phenotype as suggested by increased expression of MHC and enhanced matrix compaction. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hair follicles may be an easily accessible, autologous, and rich source of functional SMPC for cardiovascular tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

Hairs in mammals undergo well-programmed cyclic development, which is strictly controlled by the surrounding hair follicle cells. Among hair follicle epithelia the inner root sheath (IRS) directly envelops the hair shaft to mechanically support its cyclic growth, but the molecular mechanism underlying its sharp regulation remains obscure. Here, we identify regulatory elements for the expression of the IRS-specific protein AHF (Anagenic Hair Follicle antigen), the putative mouse orthologue of trichohyalin (THH), which plays a key role in the assembly of keratin intermediate filaments (IFs) during the hair cycle. AHF becomes abundantly present in the growing anagenic hair follicle and is suddenly diminished as the tissue enters into the subsequent resting stages under the control of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Using primary human keratinocytes, we found that bone morphogenic protein-4 facilitates THH transcription, and intriguingly, a nuclear lamina component plays a key role in the posttranslational stabilization of THH protein. Silencing of the lamin A/C gene leads to rapi THH degradation, whereas exogenously introduced lamin C, but not lamin A, protects THH from proteolytic elimination. These results shed light on the strict molecular mechanisms which control stage-and compartment-specific IF assemblies in support of the cyclic development of the hair shaft.",

    "text": "Review of the hair follicle origin hypothesis for basal cell carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer treated by the dermatologic surgeon. The discovery that patients with the nevoid BCC syndrome had mutations in the human homologue of the Drosophila patched gene led to a rapid increase in our understanding of the pathogenesis of BCC. It is theorized that altered regulation at multiple steps in the patched signal transduction pathway may contribute to the development of BCC. This pathway also plays an essential role in embryonic hair follicle development and during the hair cycle. Taken together, a considerable body of evidence suggests that at least some BCC may be derived from deregulated patched signaling in hair follicle stem cells. OBJECTIVE: To review evidence of a follicular derivation of BCC and to highlight emerging therapeutic strategies to block deregulated patched signaling in BCC. CONCLUSION: Deregulation of the patched signal transduction pathway is present in the vast majority of human BCCs. Pharmacologic inhibitors of this pathway may offer a therapeutic strategy to block tumor growth. The author has indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.",

Hair follicles undergo recurrent cycling of controlled growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) with a defined periodicity. Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes.",

AIM: To develop a method by which human hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) cells can be expanded in vitro while preserving their hair-inductive potential for use in follicular cell implantation, a cellular therapy for the treatment of hair loss. MATERIALS & METHODS: DP cells were isolated from scalp hair follicles in biopsies from human donors. DP cell cultures were established under conditions that preserved their hair-inductive potential and allowed for significant expansion. The hair-inductive potential of cells cultured for approximately 36 doublings was tested in an in vivo flap-graft model. In some experiments, DiI was used to label cells prior to grafting. RESULTS: Under the culture conditions developed, cultures established from numerous donors reproducibly resulted in an expansion that averaged approximately five population doublings per passage. Furthermore, the cells consistently induced hair formation in an in vivo graft assay. Grafted DP cells appeared in DP structures of newly formed hairs, as well as in the dermal sheath and in the dermis surrounding follicles. Induced hair follicles persisted and regrew after being plucked 11 months after grafting. CONCLUSION: A process for the propagation of human DP cells has been developed that provides significant expansion of cells and maintenance of their hair-inductive capability, overcoming a major technical obstacle in the development of follicular cell implantation as a treatment for hair loss.",

BACKGROUND: RhoB belongs to the Ras homologous (Rho) subfamily which consists of low molecular weight mass GTP-binding proteins. Rho proteins are regulatory molecules that mediate changes in cell shape, contractility, motility and gene expression. AIM: To test the hypothesis that ' RhoB protein is expressed in the human skin and its expression undergoes hair follicle cycle dependent changes '. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of RhoB in the normal human skin and hair follicles (HFs) using immunohistochemical methods. METHODS: A total of 50 normal human scalp skin specimens were obtained from 50 females (age: 53-57 years) undergoing elective cosmetic plastic surgery. The specimens were obtained from both frontal and temporal regions of the scalp. A total of 50 HF, (35 anagen, 10 catagen and 5 telogen) were examined in each case using immunohistologic staining methods. Semiquantitative analysis was done. RESULTS: RhoB protein was strongly expressed in the various elements of the human scalp skin and hair follicles. In the epidermis, a moderate RhoB immunoreactivity was found in all layers except stratum corneum where RhoB protein was completely absent. In sebaceous glands, a strong RhoB immunoreactivity was detected in all sebaceocytes. In the hair follicles, the expression of RhoB protein showed hair follicle cycle stages-associated changes, i. e. strong expression during anagen, but weak and completely absent expressions during catagen and telogen phases, respectively. Semiquantitative analysis revealed statistically significant high expression values (staining intensity, percentage of positive cells and immunoreactivity scores) in the anagen VI hair follicles compared to either cantagen or telogen ones (p < 0. 05). Similarly, RhoB protein expression was significantly high in the stratum basale, stratum spinosum and sebaceous glands compared to stratum granulosum (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Here we report, for the first time, the distribution of RhoB protein in the human scalp skin and hair follicles.

METHODS: The morphological features of cultured bulge stem cells were investigated by inverted phase control microscopy. Immunostaining of stem cell marker cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) and epithelial cell marker cytokeratin 19 (CK19) were performed to identify the bulge stem cell. The stemness of bulge stem cells was evaluated by colony forming efficiency (CFE) and proportion of CD34 positive cells by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Hair follicle bulge stem cells could be successfully cultivated in vitro using two methods. They were both positive for CK19 and CD34. The colony forming efficiency of hair follicle stem cell cultured in DK-SFM and the 3T3 feeder cell was 69. 4% and 62. 2%, respectively. There was no significant difference in colony forming efficiency between these two methods (P > 0. 05), while the CD34 positive cells proportion was higher in DK-SFM as 72. 3% than the other as 34. 7% (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Two methods are applicable to culture bulge stem cells in vitro. The 3T3 feeder cell method is complicated and can propagate a lot bulge stem cells from hair follicle, while the DK-SFM method is easier to get pure bulge stem cell.",

    "text": "p75 Neurotrophin receptor differentiates between morphoeic basal cell carcinoma and desmoplastic trichoepithelioma: insights into the histogenesis of adnexal tumours based on embryology and hair follicle biology. BACKGROUND: Tumour development is frequently described in the basic pathology literature as a recapitulation of embryogenesis. However, a link between the embryology of the skin and the histogenesis of adnexal tumours has been largely overlooked. The low-affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) has a profound role in hair follicle biology. We therefore speculated that it is involved in the histogenesis of follicular adnexal tumours. One of the most challenging diagnoses in dermatopathology is differentiating morphoeic basal cell carcinoma from desmoplastic trichoepithelioma. OBJECTIVES: To describe the expression pattern of p75NTR during cutaneous embryogenesis, in the adult hair follicle and in morphoeic basal cell carcinoma and desmoplastic trichoepithelioma. METHODS: Evaluation of the staining pattern for p75NTR was performed using standard immunohistochemical techniques. For comparison, we examined staining for cytokeratin 20 which highlights Merkel cells. RESULTS: All 17 desmoplastic trichoepitheliomas were immunoreactive with > 80% of the cells stained, whereas 12 of the 14 (86%) morphoeic basal cell carcinomas were p75NTR negative. In the two positive cases of morphoeic basal cell carcinoma < 30% of cells were labelled. In the late bulbous hair peg stage and in the postnatal anagen hair follicle p75NTR highlights the outer root sheath. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the classification of desmoplastic trichoepithelioma as a follicular hamartoma mimicking the outer root sheath. In contrast, the lack of p75NTR expression in morphoeic basal cell carcinoma favours a concept of this tumour as a more primitive follicular lesion with the characteristics of a carcinoma and not a hamartoma. We suggest including p75NTR as a tool in the differential diagnosis between morphoeic basal cell carcinoma and desmoplastic trichoepithelioma.",

In addition, HFCs differentiated toward adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, or SMCs in the appropriate induction medium.

Runx1/AML1 is a transcription factor implicated in tissue stem cell regulation and belongs to the small Runx family of cancer genes. In the hair follicle (HF), Runx1 epithelial deletion in morphogenesis impairs normal adult hair homeostasis (cycle) and blocks adult hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in quiescence. Here, we show that these effects are overcome later in adulthood. By deleting Runx1 after the end of morphogenesis, we demonstrate its direct role in promoting anagen onset and HFSC proliferation. Runx1 deletion resulted in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn1a (p21) upregulation. Interfering with Runx1 function in cultured HFSCs impaired their proliferation and normal G (0)/G1 and G (1)/S cell cycle progression. The proliferation defect could be rescued by Runx1 readdition or by p21 deletion. Chemically induced skin tumorigenesis in mice turned on broad Runx1 expression in regions of the skin epithelium, papillomas, and squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, it revealed reduced rates of tumor formation in the absence of Runx1 that were accompanied by decreased epithelial levels of phospho-Stat3. Runx1 protein expression was similar in normal human and mouse hair cycles. We propose that Runx1 may act as a skin oncogene by directly promoting proliferation of the epithelial cells.",

Adult stem cells (SCs) are at high risk of accumulating deleterious mutations because they reside and self-renew in adult tissues for extended periods. Little is known about how adult SCs sense and respond to DNA damage within their natural niche. Here, using mouse epidermis as a model, we define the functional consequences and the molecular mechanisms by which adult SCs respond to DNA damage. We show that multipotent hair-follicle-bulge SCs have two important mechanisms for increasing their resistance to DNA-damage-induced cell death: higher expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and transient stabilization of p53 after DNA damage in bulge SCs. The attenuated p53 activation is the consequence of a faster DNA repair activity, mediated by a higher non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity, induced by the key protein DNA-PK. Because NHEJ is an error-prone mechanism, this novel characteristic of adult SCs may have important implications in cancer development and ageing.",

Transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a member of the NF-kappaB pathway and regulates inflammatory responses. We previously showed that TAK1 also regulates keratinocyte growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, it is unknown whether TAK1 has any role in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. To examine this possibility, we studied the role of TAK1 in mouse hair follicle development and cycling as an instructive model system. By comparing keratinocyte-specific TAK1-deficient mice (Map3k7 (fl/fl) K5-Cre) with control mice, we found that the number of hair germs (hair follicles precursors) in Map3k7 (fl/fl) K5-Cre mice was significantly reduced at E15. 5, and that subsequent hair follicle morphogenesis was retarded. Next, we analyzed the role of TAK1 in the cyclic remodeling in follicles by analyzing hair cycle progression in mice with a tamoxifen-inducible keratinocyte-specific TAK1 deficiency (Map3k7 (fl/fl) K14-Cre-ER (T2)). After active hair growth (anagen) was induced by depilation, TAK1 was deleted by topical tamoxifen application. This resulted in significantly retarded anagen development in TAK1-deficient mice. Deletion of TAK1 in hair follicles that were already in anagen induced premature, apoptosis-driven hair follicle regression, along with hair follicle damage. These studies provide the first evidence that the inflammatory mediator TAK1 regulates hair follicle induction and morphogenesis, and is required for anagen induction and anagen maintenance.",

The role of neurohormones and neuropeptides in human hair follicle (HF) pigmentation extends far beyond the control of melanin synthesis by alpha-MSH and ACTH and includes melanoblast differentiation, reactive oxygen species scavenging, maintenance of HF immune privilege, and remodeling of the HF pigmentary unit (HFPU). It is now clear that human HFs are not only a target of multiple neuromediators, but also are a major non-classical production site for neurohormones such as CRH, proopiomelanocortin, ACTH, alpha-MSH, ss-endorphin, TRH, and melatonin. Moreover, human HFs have established a functional peripheral equivalent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. By charting the author ' s own meanderings through the jungle of hair pigmentation research, the current perspectives essay utilizes four clinical observations-hair repigmentation, canities, poliosis, and ' overnight greying '-as points of entry into the enigmas and challenges of. pigmentary HF neuroendocrinology. After synthesizing key principles and defining major open questions in the field, selected research avenues are delineated that appear clinically most promising.

BACKGROUND: Loose anagen hair syndrome (LAHS) is a disorder in which the hair pulls out easily and painlessly from the scalp. It first manifests in early childhood when the main concern of parents is that the sparse hair does not grow. The hair density and length improve with age, but the looseness persists into adulthood. OBJECTIVE: Light and electron microscopic studies of hair follicles were performed to better define the microscopic changes seen in LAHS. METHODS: Biopsy specimens were obtained from 4 patients, 3 children and 1 adult. The hair follicles were studied by light and electron microscopy. RESULTS: The most conspicuous structural changes were found in the inner root sheath complex of the anagen follicle. With light microscopy, the keratinized Henle cell layer showed a tortuous and irregular swelling. Irregular keratinization of the cuticle cells of the inner root sheath and a swollen appearance of Huxley cells were also found. With electron microscopy, the major pathological changes consisted of intercellular edema in the prekeratinized Huxley cell zone and dyskeratosis of Henle cells and cuticle cells of the inner root sheath. LIMITATIONS: The studies were done on a small number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Structural abnormalities of the inner root sheath appear to disturb its normal supportive and anchoring function and result in a loose attachment of the hair shaft to the anagen follicle.",

Nestin-expressing pluripotent stem cells have been found both in the bulge area (BA) as well as the dermal papilla (DP). Nestin-expressing stem cells of both the BA and DP have been previously shown to be able to form neurons and other non-follicle cell types. The nestin-expressing stem cells from the DP have been termed skin precursor or SKP cells. Both nestin-expressing DP and BA cells have been previously shown to effect repair of the injured spinal cord and peripheral nerve, with the BA being the greater and more constant source of the stem cells. The BA contains nestin-expressing stem cells throughout the hair cycle, whereas nestin-expressing dermal papillae stem cells were found in early and mid-anagen only. Our previous studies have shown that the nestin-expressing stem cells in the BA and DP have similar morphological features. The cells from both regions have a small body diameter of approximately 7 microm with long extrusions, as shown by 2-photon imaging. In the present study, using 2-photon imaging of whisker follicles from transgenic mice expressing nestin-driven green fluorescent protein (ND-GFP), we demonstrate that the BA is the source of the nestin-expressing stem cells of the hair follicle.

In HF-SCs, PcG represses nonskin lineages and HF differentiation. In TA progeny, nonskin regulators remain PcG-repressed, HF-SC regulators acquire H3K27me3-marks, and HF-lineage regulators lose them. Interestingly, genes poised in embryonic stem cells, active in HF-SCs, and PcG-repressed in TA progeny encode not only key transcription factors, but also signaling regulators. We document their importance in balancing HF-SC quiescence, underscoring the power of chromatin mapping in dissecting SC behavior.

Therefore, we have investigated whether TRH stimulates pigment production in organ-cultured human hair follicles (HFs), the epithelium of which expresses both TRH and its receptor, and/or in full-thickness human skin in situ. TRH stimulated melanin synthesis, tyrosinase transcription and activity, melanosome formation, melanocyte dendricity, gp100 immunoreactivity, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor expression in human HFs in a pituitary gland-independent manner.

Hair follicle (HF) regeneration begins when communication between quiescent epithelial stem cells (SCs) and underlying mesenchymal dermal papillae (DP) generates sufficient activating cues to overcome repressive BMP signals from surrounding niche cells. Here, we uncover a hitherto unrecognized DP transmitter, TGF-beta2, which activates Smad2/3 transiently in HFSCs concomitant with entry into tissue regeneration. This signaling is critical: HFSCs that cannot sense TGF-beta exhibit significant delays in HF regeneration, whereas exogenous TGF-beta2 stimulates HFSCs in vivo and in vitro. By engineering TGF-beta-and BMP-reporter mice, we show that TGF-beta2 signaling antagonizes BMP signaling in HFSCs but not through competition for limiting Smad4-coactivator. Rather, our microarray, molecular, and genetic studies unveil Tmeff1 as a direct TGF-beta2/Smad2/3 target gene, expressed by activated HFSCs and physiologically relevant in restricting and lowering BMP thresholds in the niche.

    "text": "Hair follicle stem cell differentiation is inhibited through cross-talk between Wnt/beta-catenin and androgen signalling in dermal papilla cells from patients with androgenetic alopecia. BACKGROUND: Hair follicle (HF) regeneration begins when signals from the mesenchyme-derived dermal papilla cells (DPC) reach multipotent epidermal stem cells in the bulge region. Wnt/beta-catenin signalling is known to affect mammalian hair growth positively. In androgenetic alopecia (AGA), androgens cause HF miniaturization through a mechanism that remains unclear. Circulating androgens act on DPC and alter paracrine factors that influence hair epithelial cells. OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the role of androgens in dermal papilla-induced differentiation of HF stem cells. METHODS: HF stem cell differentiation was evaluated in a coculture model with DPC or culturing with media conditioned by DPC after activation of androgen and Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathways. To study the molecular cross-talk between the androgen and Wnt signalling pathway in DPC, we analysed the expression and activation of downstream Wnt signalling molecules in the presence of androgens. RESULTS: In a coculture model with human DPC from patients with AGA and HF stem cells, we observed that androgens abrogate hair differentiation evaluated by hair-specific keratin 6 expression. Wnt signalling activation restored the ability of androgen-treated DPC to induce differentiation.

BACKGROUND: Narrow-band UVB (NB-UVB) is an effective therapeutic option in the treatment of vitiligo. Despite the apparent clinical efficacy, the underlying mechanism of how topical NB-UVB induces repigmentation in vitiligo has not been clearly elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of NB-UVB on the maturation of melanocyte lineage differentiated from hair follicle-derived neural crest stem cells (HF-NCSCs) in vitro. METHODS: HF-NCSCs were isolated from mouse whisker follicles. The isolated cells were multipotent and expressed embryonic NCSC biomarkers. The effects of NB-UVB on development and differentiation of HF-NCSCs were evaluated. We assessed cell viability, melanogenesis and migration of melanocytes derived from HF-NCSCs after NB-UVB radiation. Tyrosinase, Tyrp1, Dct, Kit, Mc1R, Fzd4, NT3R, Ednra, EP1, TGFbetaR, Sox10, Mitf, Lef1 and Pax3 gene expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR, while Tyrosinase, Sox10 and Mitf protein expression were measured by Western blot analysis. Cell migration was measured by Boyden chamber transwell assay. RESULTS: NB-UVB increased the expression of tyrosinase during melanocytic differentiation from mouse HF-NCSCs, however, NB-UVB inhibited proliferation of melanocytes derived from HF-NCSCs. Mechanistically, increased melanocyte maturation after NB-UVB treatment was resulted from increased expression of several key melanogenic factors, including Sox10, Kit and Mc1R, which play a critical role to promote tyrosinase expression. Furthermore, the migration of the HF-NCSCs-derived melanocytes was downregulated as NB-UVB doses increased. However, the migration of HF-NCSCs was upregulated under 0. 4J NB-UVB radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Those data provide in vitro evidence demonstrating some direct effects of NB-UVB on pigmentation of melanocyte lineage differentiated from HF-NCSCs, and may provide a possible mechanism for the effect of NB-UVB in vitiligo.",

By using melanocyte-targeted Dct-LacZ transgenic mice, we found that Wnt3a signaling is activated in mouse HF melanocytes during anagen of hair cycle. To further explore the potential functions of Wnt3a in mouse melanocytes, we infected melan-a cells with AdWnt3a to serve as the production source of Wnt3a protein. We demonstrated that Wnt3a promoted melanogenesis through upregulation of MITF and its downstream genes, tyrosinase and TRP1, in melanocytes. In vivo, AdWnt3a rescued the effects of AdsimMITF on HF melanocytes and promoted melanin synthesis. Our results suggest that Wnt3a plays an important role in mouse HF melanocytes homeostasis.",

Despite the discovery of the widely expressed CLCA (chloride channel regulators, calcium-activated) proteins more than 15 years ago, their seemingly diverse functions are still poorly understood. With the recent generation of porcine animal models for cystic fibrosis (CF), members of the porcine CLCA family are becoming of interest as possible modulators of the disease in the pig. Here, we characterize pCLCA2, the porcine ortholog of the human hCLCA2 and the murine mCLCA5, which are the only CLCA members expressed in the skin. Immunohistochemical studies with a specific antibody against pCLCA2 have revealed a highly restricted pCLCA2 protein expression in the skin. The protein is strictly co-localized with filaggrin and trichohyalin in the granular layer of the epidermis and the inner root sheath of the hair follicles, respectively. No differences have been observed between the expression patterns of wild-type pigs and CF transmembrane conductance regulator (-/-) pigs.

This reliable cultivation procedure begins with the epilation of 60 hairs and yields high numbers of ORS melanocytes that could be used for grafting applications.

Stem cells that are characterized by self-renewal, high proliferation and multiple differentiation potentials have attracted attention in cell-based regenerative medicine. Maintaining the aforementioned characteristics of stem cells is the first key step in cell-based regenerative medicine. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a well-known growth factor that efficiently maintains the self-renewal, high proliferation and multilineage differentiation potential of stem cells. Whether or not other growth factors, such as acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) have similar effects has yet to be fully elucidated. Human hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells (HF-MSCs) were obtained by organ culture. They exhibited surface markers of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells as shown by positive staining for CD44, CD73, CD90 and CD105, and they also displayed trilineage differentiation potentials into adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts by cytochemistry and qRT-PCR. Flow cytometry analysis showed that up to 70% of HF-MSCs cultured in the presence of aFGF, bFGF or EGF stayed at the G0/G1 phase. Proliferation analysis showed that both bFGF and EGF at as low as 1 ng/ml and aFGF at above 5 ng/ml levels significantly increased the proliferation of HF-MSCs by cell counting. Consistent with proliferation analysis, immunofluorescence staining showed that more than 95% of HF-MSCs cultured in the presence of aFGF, bFGF and EGF were positively stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen. HF-MSCs cultured in the presence of aFGF, bFGF or EGF retained marked trilineage differentiation potentials. By contrast, HF-MSCs cultured in the absence of bFGF, aFGF and EGF lost multipotency.",

An attractive model to study processes related to neurodevelopment in schizophrenia is reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiating them into different neuronal lineages. iPSCs from three schizophrenia patients and from two controls were reprogrammed from hair follicle keratinocytes, because of their accessibility and common ectodermal origin with neurons. iPSCs were differentiated into Pax6 (+)/Nestin (+) neural precursors and then further differentiated into beta3-Tubulin (+)/tyrosine hydroxylase (+)/DAT (+) dopaminergic neurons. In addition, iPSCs were differentiated through embryonic bodies into beta3-Tubulin (+)/Tbox brain1 (+) glutamatergic neurons. Schizophrenia-derived dopaminergic cells showed severely impaired ability to differentiate, whereas glutamatergic cells were unable to maturate. Mitochondrial respiration and its sensitivity to dopamine-induced inhibition were impaired in schizophrenia-derived keratinocytes and iPSCs. Moreover, we observed dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and perturbations in mitochondrial network structure and connectivity in dopaminergic along the differentiation process and in glutamatergic cells.

Human hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells (hHF-MSCs) are capable of differentiating into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in response to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and thus can be used for cardiovascular tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying SMC conversion of hHF-MSCs are still undefined. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to the complementary sequences of targeted mRNAs. Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs are associated with SMC differentiation in vitro andin vivo. In this study, we revealed that miR-18b was significantly downregulated during TGF-beta1-induced hHF-MSCs differentiation into SMC using miRNA array profiling and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). Over-expression of miR-18b in hHF-MSCs led to remarkable downregulation of SMC-specific markers such as SMA and calponin proteins. On the contrary, inhibition of endogenous miR-18b by its antisense oligonucleotide antagomir-18b reversed the changes of SMA and calponin proteins. We also showed that SMAD2, a key transcription regulator in TGF-beta signaling which was involved in SMC differentiation, is regulated by miR-18b. miR-18b could suppress the expression of SMAD2 protein by targeting the 3 ' UTR of SMAD2 gene without affecting its mRNA level in hHF-MSCs. Moreover, knockdown of SMAD2 by RNA interference could block the effect of inhibition of miR-18b on SMC differentiation, indicating that SMAD2 contributed to miR-18b mediated regulation of TGF-beta-induced SMC differentiation. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that miR-18b regulated the TGF-beta1-induced differentiation of hHF-MSCs into SMCs by targeting SMAD2 gene, and provided novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of TGF-beta-induced SMC differentiation.",

BACKGROUND: Segmental vitiligo is a small subset albeit persistent form of focal vitiligo with dermatomal distributionand resistant to medical therapy. In recent years, surgical therapy as hair follicle autograft transplantationhas been a hot topic in management of segmental vitiligo. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of thismethod in segmental vitiligo lesions. METHODS: The study recruited 10 patients who suffered from resistant segmental vitiligo to evaluate the effectof transplantation of pigmented hair follicles on re-pigmentation of the affected area. In this method, one or twopunched-biopsy skin sample with a diameter of 5mm were harvested from occipital area of the scalps. Graftswere trimmed and divided into the follicular segments with at least one follicle in the interior and then insertedin the depigmented areas. Follow-up plan studies were scheduled to evaluate presence of pigmentation in theperifollicular areas. RESULTS: After 2 weeks, re-pigmentation was detectable surrounding the grafted hair follicles in 60% of thecases. After 6 months, all of the patients had detectable re-pigmented area of about 2-9 mm. CONCLUSION: giving the surprising result of the study, hair follicle autograft transplant is an effective treatmentoption in the persistent segmental vitiligo.",

    "text": "Hair transplantation in mice: Challenges and solutions. Hair follicle cells contribute to wound healing, skin circulation, and skin diseases including skin cancer, and hair transplantation is a useful technique to study the participation of hair follicle cells in skin homeostasis and wound healing. Although hair follicle transplantation is a well-established human hair-restoration procedure, follicular transplantation techniques in animals have a number of shortcomings and have not been well described or optimized. To facilitate the study of follicular stem and progenitor cells and their interaction with surrounding skin, we have established a new murine transplantation model, similar to follicular unit transplantation in humans. Vibrissae from GFP transgenic mice were harvested, flip-side microdissected, and implanted individually into needle hole incisions in the back skin of immune-deficient nude mice. Grafts were evaluated histologically and the growth of transplanted vibrissae was observed. Transplanted follicles cycled spontaneously and newly formed hair shafts emerged from the skin after 2 weeks. Ninety percent of grafted vibrissae produced a hair shaft at 6 weeks. After pluck-induced follicle cycling, growth rates were equivalent to ungrafted vibrissae. Transplanted vibrissae with GFP-positive cells were easily identified in histological sections. We established a follicular vibrissa transplantation method that recapitulates human follicular unit transplantation. This method has several advantages over current protocols for animal hair transplantation. The method requires no suturing and minimizes the damage to donor follicles and recipient skin. Vibrissae are easier to microdissect and transplant than pelage follicles and, once transplanted, are readily distinguished from host pelage hair. This facilitates measurement of hair growth. Flip-side hair follicle microdissection precisely separates donor follicular tissue from interfollicular tissue and donor cells remain confined to hair follicles. This makes it possible to differentiate migration of hair follicle cells from interfollicular epidermis in lineage tracing wound experiments using genetically labeled donor follicles.",

    "text": "Role of thymosin beta 4 in hair growth. Although thymosin beta 4 (Tbeta4) is known to play a role in hair growth, its mechanism of action is unclear. We examined the levels of key genes in a Tbeta4 epidermal-specific over-expressing mouse model and Tbeta4 global knockout mouse model to explore how Tbeta4 affects hair growth. By depilation and histological examination of the skin, we confirmed the effect of Tbeta4 on hair growth, the number of hair shafts and hair follicle (HF) structure. The mRNA and protein expression of several genes involved in hair growth were detected by real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Changes in the expression of beta-catenin and Lef-1, the two key molecules in the Wnt signaling pathway, were similar to the changes observed in Tbeta4 expression. We also found that compared to the control mice, the mRNA and protein expression of MMP-2 and VEGF were increased in the Tbeta4 over-expressing mice, while the level of E-cadherin (E-cad) remained the same. Further, in the Tbeta4 global knockout mice, the mRNA and protein levels of MMP-2 and VEGF decreased dramatically and the level of E-cad was stable. Based on the above results, we believe that Tbeta4 may regulate the levels of VEGF and MMP-2 via the Wnt/beta-catenin/Lef-1 signaling pathway to influence the growth of blood vessels around HFs and to activate cell migration. Tbeta4 may have potential for the treatment of hair growth problems in adults, and its effects should be further confirmed in future studies.",

    "text": "Induced pluripotent stem cells from human hair follicle keratinocytes as a potential source for in vitro hair follicle cloning. BACKGROUND: Human hair follicles are important for the renewal of new hairs and their development. The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from hair follicles is easy due to its accessibility and availability. The pluripotent cells derived from hair follicles not only have a higher tendency to re-differentiate into hair follicles, but are also more suited for growth in hair scalp tissue microenvironment. METHODS: In this study, human hair follicular keratinocytes were used to generate iPSCs, which were then further differentiated in vitro into keratinocytes. The derived iPSCs were characterised by using immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and reverse-transcription PCR to check for its pluripotency markers expression. RESULTS: The iPSC clones expressed pluripotency markers such as TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA4, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, LEFTY, and GABRB. The well-formed three germ layers were observed during differentiation using iPSCs derived from hair follicles. The successful formation of keratioctyes from iPSCs was confirmed by the expression of cytokeratin 14 marker. DISCUSSION: Hair follicles represent a valuable keratinocytes source for in vitro hair cloning for use in treating hair balding or grafting in burn patients. Our significant findings in this report proved that hair follicles could be used to produce pluripotent stem cells and suggested that the genetic and micro-environmental elements of hair follicles might trigger higher and more efficient hair follicles re-differentiation.",

Wnt signaling plays crucial role in regulating melanocyte stem cells/melanocyte differentiation in the hair follicle. However, how the Wnt signaling is balanced to be overactivated to control follicular melanocytes behavior remains unknown. Here, by using immunofluorescence staining, we showed that secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4) is preferentially expressed in the skin epidermal cells rather than in melanocytes. By overexpression of sFRP4 in skin cells in vivo and in vitro, we found that sFRP4 attenuates activation of Wnt signaling, resulting in decrease of melanocytes differentiation in the regenerating hair follicle. Our findings unveiled a new regulator that involves modulating melanocytes differentiation through a paracrine mechanism in hair follicle, supplying a hope for potential therapeutic application to treat skin pigmentation disorders.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether feeder layers composed of human hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hHFDCs) are able to support human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). hHFDCs and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated and cultured in Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium (DMEM)/F-12 and low-glucose DMEM, respectively. hHFDCs were passaged three times and subsequently characterized. hHFDCs and MEFs were mitotically inactivated with mitomycin C for 3 h prior to co-culture with H9-hESCs. hESCs were initially established on a mouse feeder layer, subsequently transferred onto a human feeder layer and split every 5 days. Cell morphology, expression of specific ' undifferentiation ' markers and growth factors, and the differentiation capacity of hESCs grown on the hHFDC feeder layer were analyzed. hHFDCs are adherent to plastic, possess the classic mesenchymal stem cell phenotype [they express cluster of differentiation (CD) 90, CD73 and CD105] and are able to differentiate into adipocytes, chondroblasts and osteocytes, indicating that these cells are multipotent. Population-doubling time analysis revealed that hHFDCs rapidly proliferate over 34. 5 h. As a feeder layer, hHFDC behaved similarly to MEF in maintaining the morphology of hESCs. The results of alkaline phosphatase activity, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the expression of pluripotency transcription factors [octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), Nanog and sex determining region Y-box 2], and immunofluorescence assays of markers (stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 and Oct4) in hESCs co-cultured over hHFDC, indicated that the undifferentiated state of hESCs was preserved. No change in the level of growth factor transcripts (bone morphogenetic protein 4, fibroblast growth factor-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, Pigment epithelium-derived factor and transforming growth factor-beta1) was detected for either feeder layer prior to or following inactivation. Similar phenotypes of embryoid body formation, size and morphology were observed in the hHFDC and MEF feeders. In conclusion, hHFDC maintained hESCs in an undifferentiated state comparable to MEF in standard conditions, which may be an important finding regarding the establishment of stem cell-based translational applications.",

OBJECTIVE: Dermal papilla and hair epithelial stem cells regulate hair formation and the growth cycle. Damage to or loss of these cells can cause hair loss. Although several studies claim to reconstitute hairs using rodent cells in an animal model, additional research is needed to develop a stable human hair follicle reconstitution protocol. In this study, we have evaluated hair induction by injecting adult cultured human dermal papilla cells and a mixture of hair epithelial and dermal papilla cells in a mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, discarded human scalp skins were used to obtain dermal papilla and hair epithelial cells. After separation, cells were cultured and assessed for their characteristics. We randomly allocated 15 C57BL/6 nude mice into three groups that received injections in their dorsal skin. The first group received cultured dermal papilla cells, the second group received a mixture of cultured epithelial and dermal papilla cells, and the third group (control) received a placebo [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-)]. RESULTS: Histopathologic examination of the injection sites showed evidence of hair growth in samples that received cells compared with the control group. However, the group that received epithelial and dermal papilla cells had visible evidence of hair growth. PKH tracing confirmed the presence of transplanted cells in the new hair. CONCLUSION: Our data showed that injection of a combination of adult human cultured dermal papilla and epithelial cells could induce hair growth in nude mice. This study emphasized that the combination of human adult cultured dermal papilla and epithelial cells could induce new hair in nude mice.",

The easily accessible niche represented by skin and its appendages may serve as a promising source to complement modern regenerative medicine for horses. In humans and in animal models for human medicine, the hair follicle and its stem cell niches are well characterized. Since literature in this field of equine research is scarce, we sought to analyze cells of the dermal stem cell niche of the equine hair follicle morphologically and for a subset of markers useful for cell characterization via immunolabeling. We cultured equine forelock skin explants to obtain cultures with cells migrating from the hair follicles. Isolation of cells revealed typical fibroblast morphology with a strong tendency to aggregate and form spheroids. For immunofluorescent characterization of primary isolations, we tested an antibody panel consisting of lineage makers for the dermal compartment of the hair follicle, markers associated with an undifferentiated cell status and markers for epithelial cell types as negative controls. All antibodies used were also tested on equine skin sections. The isolated cells displayed clear profiles of dermal and undifferentiated cells. To substantiate our findings, we tested our primary isolations for established equine multipotent mesenchymal stromal cell antigen expression markers in flow cytometry experiments yielding strong convergence. The data presented here provide insights to a stem cell source in horses almost unnoticed to date.

Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in hair follicle morphogenesis and hair growth. Recently, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) was evaluated for stimulating hair growth in numerous clinical studies, in which 655-nm red light was found to be most effective and practical for stimulating hair growth. We evaluated whether 655-nm red light + light-emitting diode (LED) could promote human hair growth by activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. An in vitro culture of human hair follicles (HFs) was irradiated with different intensities of 655-nm red light + LED, 21 h7 (an inhibitor of beta-catenin), or both. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to assess the expression of beta-catenin, GSK3beta, p-GSK3beta, and Lef1 in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. The 655-nm red light + LED not only enhanced hair shaft elongation, but also reduced catagen transition in human hair follicle organ culture, with the greatest effectiveness observed at 5 min (0. 839 J/cm2). Additionally, 655-nm red light + LED enhanced the expression of beta-catenin, p-GSK3beta, and Lef1, signaling molecules of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, in the hair matrix.

Recently, VEGFR-2 has been detected not only in vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells but also in some non-vascular endothelial cells, particularly human hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. In addition, VEGFR-2 has been confirmed to play direct roles in hair follicle keratinocyte regulation beyond simply angiogenesis. To elucidate whether VEGFR-2 activation plays a role in hair follicle cycling regulation, immunofluorescence of VEGFR-2 expression was performed during hair cycling of the dorsum of the mouse induced by hair plucking. We observed that staining for VEGFR-2 in hair follicles during anagen II and IV was much stronger than during anagen VI, catagen and telogen. During anagen II, intense staining for VEGFR-2 was observed on the keratinocyte strands of the hair follicle. Subsequently, we detected intense staining for VEGFR-2 in the ORS, IRS and hair bulb during anagen IV. Moderate staining for VEGFR-2 was detected in the ORS and hair bulb, but staining was most intense in IRS during anagen VI. During catagen, staining for VEGFR-2 in the IRS remained intense, while staining in the ORS and hair bulb was significantly weakened and was negative in the dermal papilla. During telogen, we detected VEGFR-2 in germ cells, cap, and club hair adjoining the epidermis. In conclusion, VEGFR-2 was expressed on the hair follicles of the dorsum of the mouse and varied in expression on the mouse hair follicles during hair cycling, suggesting that VEGFR-2 may exert roles in hair cycle regulation in hair follicles on the dorsum of mice.",

At 3 weeks after transplantation, although pigmented mouse hairs could efficiently form at the injection sites with delivery of mouse cells, none hair formed on the host mouse skin at 3 months after delivery of human cells. Under the same conditions, human follicles could be regenerated when the human skin cells were delivered onto a 2 mm size punch created on a reconstituted human skin (hRSK), which previously generated on the back of an immunodeficient mouse, but the efficiency of hair formation was low. We demonstrated that both mouse and human regenerated follicles showed normal histology and differentiation markers ; moreover, the cell chasing experiment confirmed that the regenerated hair follicles were formed from transplanted cells. Compared to other current hair reconstituted assays, the Punch Assay is relatively simple and generates normal hair follicles within a smaller wound.

In mammals, desynchronized circadian rhythm leads to various biological symptoms. In skin and hair, human epidermal stem cell function in vitro is regulated by circadian oscillations, and thus contributes to tissue aging when deregulated. In mice, circadian arrhythmia of hair follicle stem cells contributes to age-related hair follicle cycling defects. Despite the well-described impact of circadian oscillations through a feedback loop involving the clock pathway on hair and skin stem cell function in vitro, little is known about the change in characteristics or regenerative properties of hHF (human hair follicle keratinocytes), hEpi (human interfollicular epidermal keratinocytes), and hHFDP (hair follicle dermal papilla stem cells) after long-term alteration of circadian rhythm in vivo. The present study was designed to asses hHF, hEpi, and hHFDP precursors and stem cell properties in response to clock pathway alteration due to long-term deregulated circadian rhythm in vivo. A clinical study protocol was designed to include two groups of women: diurnal workers (control) and shift workers (deregulated). After informed consent, two 3-mm fresh punch biopsies were taken from the occipital region of each donor (10 donors/group). Cell culture characterization, measurement of colony area, culture medium analysis, and RT-qPCR analysis were carried out. Long-term circadian rhythm deregulation affected clock pathway protein expression and correlated with alterations in hHF, hEpi, and hHFDP properties. This study provides, for the first time in humans, evidence that in vivo deregulation of the clock pathway affects regenerative properties of human skin and hair precursor cells.",

FSC may engraft in a variety of maternal tissues especially if there is organ/tissue injury, but their role and mechanism of persistence still remains elusive. Clinical applications due to their pluripotency, immunomodulatory effects and accessibility make them good candidates for ex-vivo manipulation and autologous therapies. The hair follicles contain a distinctive niche for pluripotent stem cells (PSC). To date, there is no published evidence of fetal microchimerism in the hair follicle. In our study, follicular unit extraction (FUE) technique allowed easy stem cell cultures to be obtained while simple hair follicle removal by pull-out technique failed to generate stem cells in culture. We identified microchimeric fetal stem cells within the primitive population of maternal stem cells isolated from the hair follicles with typical mesenchymal phenotype, expression of PSC genes and differentiation potential towards osteocytes, adypocites and chondrocytes.

Methods: In the present study, eight six-month-old ewes from Super Merino (SM) and Small Tailed Han (STH) sheep breeds were selected. Target prediction and dual-luciferase wild-type and mutant vectors were used to identify the target genes of miR-21. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and bioinformatics analysis were conducted to analyze the effects of miR-21. Results: The results show that the expressions of CNKSR2, KLF3 and TNPO1 were downregulated by miRNA-21 at rates of 36%, 26% and 48%, respectively. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation between the expression of miR-21 and the three target genes in sheep with two extreme phenotypes. The expression of microRNA-21in October was significantly lower than that in January and February ; while the expression of CNKSR2, KLF3 and TNPO1 in October was higher than that in January and February.

Polyamines are associated with proliferation, and several polyamines including spermidine and spermine play anti-inflammatory roles. Androgenic alopecia results from increased dihydrotestosterone metabolism, and alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease. This study aimed to investigate differences in polyamine profiles in hair samples between patients with androgenic alopecia and alopecia areata. Polyamine concentrations were determined through high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hair samples were derivatized with isobutyl chloroformate. Differences in polyamine levels were observed between androgenic alopecia and alopecia areata compared with normal controls. In particular, polyamine levels were higher in alopecia areata patients than in normal controls. Certain polyamines displayed different concentrations between the androgenic alopecia and alopecia areata groups, suggesting that some polyamines, particularly N-acetyl putrescine (P = 0. 007) and N-acetyl cadaverine (P = 0. 0021), are significantly different in androgenic alopecia. Furthermore, spermidine (P = 0. 021) was significantly different in alopecia areata. Our findings suggest that non-invasive quantification of hair polyamines may help distinguish between androgenic alopecia and alopecia areata. Our study provides novel insights into physiological alterations in patients with androgenic alopecia and those with alopecia areata and reveals some differences in polyamine levels in hair loss diseases with two different modes of action.",

The human hair follicle is a neuroendocrine mini-organ that can be used to study aging processes in vitro. Neurotrophins maintain homeostasis in hair biology via the Trk-family of receptors. TrkA, the high affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), is expressed in hair follicle melanocytes and keratinocytes, where it regulates proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis and may thereby play a role in hair pigmentation and growth. We investigated TrkA expression during the human hair cycle and the effects of a selective high affinity TrkA agonist, Gambogic Amide, on hair pigmentation and hair growth in human hair follicles in vitro. In human scalp skin, TrkA expression was strongest in proliferating melanocytes re-establishing the pigmentary unit in the hair bulb during the early hair growth phase, anagen. During high anagen and in the de-composing pigmentary-unit of the regression phase, catagen, bulb-melanocytes lost TrkA expression and only undifferentiated outer root sheath melanocytes maintained it. In cultured human anagen hair follicles, Gambogic Amide was able to prevent gradual pigment loss, while it stimulated hair shaft elongation. This was achieved by increased melanocyte activation, migration and dendricity, highlighted by distinct c-KIT-expression in melanocyte sub-populations. Our results suggest that Gambogic Amide can maintain hair follicle pigmentation by acting on undifferentiated melanocytes residing in the outer root sheath and making them migrate to establish the pigmentary-unit. This suggests that the selective TrkA agonist Gambogic Amide acts as an anti-hair greying and hair growth promoting molecule in vitro.",

Hair growth and morphology are generally regulated by the hair cycle in mammals. Fibroblast Growth Factor 5 (FGF5), which is a hair cycle regulator, has a role in regulating the hair cycle during the transition from the anagen phase to the catagen phase, and a hereditary long hair phenotype has been widely reported when FGF5 is mutated in humans and other species. However, there has been no such report in rabbits. Thus, the first exon of rabbit FGF5 was disrupted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and the phenotype of FGF5-/-rabbits was characterized while using hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining, immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, scanning electron microscopy, and western blotting. The results showed a significant and systemic long hair phenotype in the FGF5-/-rabbits, which indicated that FGF5 is a negative regulator of hair growth. In addition, a decreased diameter of the fiber and a higher area proportion of hair follicle clusters were determined in FGF5-/-rabbits as compared with the WT rabbits. Further investigation verified that prolonging the anagen phase in rabbits, with decreased BMP2/4 pathway signaling and increased VERSICAN pathway signaling, caused the systemic long hair phenotype. Taken together, these results indicate a systemic long hair phenotype by prolonging anagen in FGF5-/-rabbits, which could be widely used for Fur production and an ideal model for studying the mechanism of long hair in the future.",

The dermal papilla cell (DPC) is a type of highly specialized mesenchymal cells located in hair follicles (HF). Due to the primary role in the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that enables hair-follicle morphogenesis and hair cycling, DPC has become an attractive cell source for hair regeneration to treat alopecia patients. However, DPCs tend to lose their function during in vitro culture. Hence, there exists a clear need to develop a microenvironment that can recapitulate the interactions within the native milieu of DPCs. Since layer-by-layer (LBL) nano-coating with biocompatible materials on the cell surface displays the versatility with tunable loading and release properties, which can provide a remodeled microenvironment for regulating cell function. Here, we developed a LBL self-assembly technique to single DPCs to create a nano-scale ultrathin extracellular matrix (ECM). We studied that the single cell-based LBL-encapsulation would not impact the viability, morphology, proliferation and intrinsic properties of DPCs using Western blot and mRNA expressions of beta-catenin, ALP and alpha-SMA. We then included fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) into the LBL nano-structure to regulate the DPC function. Finally, we performed in vivo hair reconstitution assays using LBL-encapsulated DPCs combined with freshly isolated epidermal cells (EPCs) and found this strategy can treat hair loss.",

INTRODUCTION: Hair follicles are produced in a cyclical manner and the machinery involved in the reproduction of these follicles is present since the fetal stage.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed here, the immunoexpression of beta-1 integrin, p-cadherin, e-cadherin, and beta-catenin in hair follicles from 26 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded skin samples from human embryos and fetus between 12-23 weeks of gestational age. RESULTS: The adhesion molecules beta-1 integrin and e-cadherin/p-cadherin were expressed from 12 weeks and seemed to play a role in regulating epidermis invagination. Beta-catenin immunostaining was negative in all cases ; down regulation of this protein may be necessary for fetal hair development and thus facilitating hair follicle down growth. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Adhesion molecules are essential for hair follicle down growth and proliferation ; integrins and cadherins play a major role in this process.

    "text": "Polygonum multiflorum extract support hair growth by elongating anagen phase and abrogating the effect of androgen in cultured human dermal papilla cells. BACKGROUND: Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) play a key role in hair growth among the various cell types in hair follicles. Especially, DPCs determine the fate of hair follicle such as anagen to telogen transition and play a pivotal role in androgenic alopecia (AGA). This study was performed to elucidate the hair growth promoting effects of Polygonum multiflorum extract (PM extract) in cultured human DPCs and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The effects of PM extract on cultured DPCs were investigated. Cell viability and mitochondrial activity were measured by CCK-8 and JC-1 analysis, respectively. Western blotting, dot blotting, ELISA analysis, immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR analysis were also performed to elucidate the changes in protein and mRNA levels induced by PM extract. 3D cultured DPC spheroids were constructed for mimicking the in vivo DPs. The hair growth stimulatory effect of PM extract was evaluated using human hair follicle organ culture model. RESULTS: PM extract increased the viability and mitochondrial activity in cultured human DPCs in a dose dependent manner. The expression of Bcl2, an anti-apoptotic protein expressed dominantly in anagen was significantly increased and that of BAD, a pro-apoptotic protein expressed in early catagen was decreased by PM extract in cultured DPCs and/or 3D DPC spheroid culture. PM extract also decreased the expression of catagen inducing protein, Dkk-1. Growth factors including IGFBP2, PDGF and VEGF were increased by PM extract, revealed by dot blot protein analysis. We also have found that PM extract could reverse the androgenic effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent androgen. Finally, PM extract prolonged the anagen of human hair follicles by inhibiting catagen entry in human hair follicle organ culture model. CONCLUSION: Our data strongly suggest that PM extract could promote hair growth by elongating the anagen and/or delaying the catagen induction of hair follicles through activation of DPCs.",

    "text": "Pro-inflammatory Vdelta1 + T-cells infiltrates are present in and around the hair bulbs of non-lesional and lesional alopecia areata hair follicles. BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that NKG2D + cells are critically involved in alopecia areata (AA) pathogenesis. However, besides being expressed in CD8 + T-cells and NK cells, NKG2D is also found in human gammadeltaT-cells. AA lesional hair follicles (HFs) overexpress NKG2D and gammadeltaTCR activating ligands, e. g. MICA and CD1d, and chemoattractants for gammadeltaT-cells, such as CXCL10. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether abnormal activities of gammadeltaT-cells may be involved in AA pathogenesis. METHODS: We analyzed the number and activation status of gammadeltaT-cells in human healthy, lesional and non-lesional AA scalp biopsies by FACS and/or quantitative (immuno-) histomorphometry. RESULTS: In healthy human scalp skin, the few skin-resident gammadeltaT-cells were found to be mostly Vdelta1 +, non-activated (CD69-NKG2Ddim) and positive for CXCL10, and CXCL12 receptors. These Vdelta1 + T-cells predominantly localized in/around the HF infundibulum. In striking contrast, the number of Vdelta1 + T-cells was significantly higher around and even inside the proximal (suprabulbar and bulbar) epithelium of lesional AA HFs. These cells also showed a pro-inflammatory phenotype, i. e. higher NKG2D, and IFN-gamma and lower CD200R expression. Importantly, more pro-inflammatory Vdelta1 + T-cells were seen also around non-lesional AA HFs. Lesional AA HFs also showed significantly higher expression of CXCL12. CONCLUSION: Our pilot study introduces skin-resident gammadeltaT-cells as a previously overlooked, but potentially important, mostly (auto-) antigen-independent, new innate immunity protagonist in AA pathobiology. The HF infiltration of these activated, IFN-gamma-releasing cells already around non-lesional AA HFs suggest that Vdelta1 + T-cells are involved in the early stages of human AA pathobiology, and may thus deserve therapeutic targeting for optimal AA management.",

The expression of glypicans in different hair follicle (HF) compartments and their potential roles during hair shaft growth are still poorly understood. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) distribution in HFs is classically investigated by conventional histology, biochemical analysis, and immunohistochemistry. In this report, a novel approach is proposed to assess hair histology and HSPG distribution changes in HFs at different phases of the hair growth cycle using infrared spectral imaging (IRSI). The distribution of HSPGs in HFs was probed by IRSI using the absorption region relevant to sulfation as a spectral marker. The findings were supported by Western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry assays focusing on the glypican-1 expression and distribution in HFs. This study demonstrates the capacity of IRSI to identify the different HF tissue structures and to highlight protein, proteoglycan (PG), glycosaminoglycan (GAG), and sulfated GAG distribution in these structures. The comparison between anagen, catagen, and telogen phases shows the qualitative and/or quantitative evolution of GAGs as supported by Western immunoblotting. Thus, IRSI can simultaneously reveal the location of proteins, PGs, GAGs, and sulfated GAGs in HFs in a reagent-and label-free manner.

Gain-of-function mutations in the TRPV3 gene can cause Olmsted syndrome characterized by palmoplantar and periorificial keratoderma, itch, and hair loss. The mechanism underlying the hair loss remains unclear. In this study, we engineered an Olmsted syndrome mouse model by introducing the point mutation G568V to the corresponding Trpv3 locus in the mice. These mice developed fully penetrant hair loss. The hair loss was associated with premature differentiation of follicular keratinocytes characterized by precocious degeneration of trichohyalin and keratins, increased production of deiminated proteins, elevated apoptosis, and attenuation of transcription regulators (Foxn1, Msx2, Dlx3, and Gata3) known to regulate hair follicle differentiation. These abnormalities occurred in the medial-proximal region of the inner root sheath and the hair shaft, where Trpv3 is highly expressed, and correlated with an impaired formation of the hair canal and the hair shaft. The mutant Trpv3 mice also exhibited increased proliferation in the outer root sheath, accelerated hair cycle, reduction of hair follicle stem cells, and miniaturization of regenerated hair follicles. Findings from this study suggest that precocious maturation of postmitotic follicular keratinocytes drives hair loss in patients with Olmsted syndrome.",

Gray ex Benth are traditionally used in French Polynesia for hair and skin care. During the hair cycle, dermal papilla cells and their interaction with epithelial cells are essential to promote hair follicle elongation. The aim of our investigations was the identification of metabolites from these three plants and chemical families responsible for their hair growth activity. A bioactivity-based molecular network was produced by mapping the correlation between features obtained from LC-MS/MS data and dermal papilla cell proliferation, using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The analyses pointed out glycosylated flavonols and phenolic acids from B. pilosa and C. inophyllum, along with C-flavonoids, iridoids and secoiridoids from F. berteroana, as potential bioactive molecules involved in the proliferation of hair follicle dermal papilla cells. Our results highlight the metabolites of the plant species potentially involved in the induction of hair follicle growth and support the traditional uses of these plants in hair care.",

Quiescent hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) reside in specialized bulge niche where they undergo activation and differentiation upon sensing niche-dependent signals during hair follicle (HF) homeostasis and wound repair. The underlying mechanism of HFSCs and bulge niche maintenance is poorly understood. Our previous study has reported that a transcription factor, forkhead box P1 (Foxp1), functions to maintain the quiescence of HFSCs. Here, we further discovered that forkhead box P4 (Foxp4), a close family member of Foxp1, had similar expression profiles in various components of HFs and formed a complex with Foxp1 in vitro and in vivo. The HF-specific deficiency of Foxp4 resulted in the precocious activation of HFSCs during hair cycles. In contrast to single Foxp1 or Foxp4 conditional knockout (cKO) mice, Foxp1/4 double cKO exerted an additive effect in the spectrum and severity of phenotypes in HFSC activation, hair cycling acceleration and hair loss, coupled with remarkable downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 18 (Fgf18) and bone morphogenetic protein 6 (Bmp6) expression in bulge cells. In addition, the double KO of Foxp1/4 induced the apoptosis of K6-positive (K6 +) inner bulge cells, a well-established stem cell (SC) niche, thus resulting in the destruction of the bulge SC niche and recurrent hair loss. Our investigation reveals the synergistic role of Foxp1/4 in sustaining K6 + niche cells for the quiescence of HFSCs.",

Basaloid follicular hamartomas (BFH) are benign small basaloid skin tumors that can present as solitary or multiple lesions. Congenital BFH lesions arranged in a segmental distribution have been described, suggesting they derive from a somatic post-zygotic mutational event. Previously, BFH were described in Happle-Tinschert syndrome, which results from a post-zygotic SMO variant and is characterized by segmental BFH with variable involvement of the teeth, skeleton, and central nervous system. Here, we describe two patients with isolated segmental BFH and no systemic involvement. Paired whole exome sequencing of BFH and normal tissue revealed a pathogenic SMO c. 1234 C > T, p. L412F variant restricted to BFH tissue. We characterized the proliferation index and expression of Hedgehog and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway related proteins in segmental BFH compared to sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and found that segmental BFH had a lower proliferation index. Although segmental BFH expressed a similar level of Gli-1 compared to BCCs, levels of LEF-1 and SOX-9 expression in BFH were weaker for both and patchier for LEF-1. Our results show that a somatic SMO activating variant causes segmental BFH. Since these patients are prone to developing BCCs, differences in SOX9, LEF1, and Ki-67 expression can help distinguish between these two basaloid lesions.",

Doxorubicin, a widely used cancer chemotherapy drug, induces disruption of the hair cycle and subsequent alopecia. We show in this report that doxorubicin causes disruption of the hair-follicle-associated blood vessel network resulting in a greatly reduced density of these blood vessels. Dystrophic hair follicles were also observed with abnormal melanogenesis in the mice treated with doxorubicin. Visualization of the effect of doxorubicin on hair-follicle angiogenesis was made possible by the use of transgenic mice in which green fluorescent protein was driven by regulatory elements of the nestin gene (ND-GFP). In these transgenic mice, the hair-follicle stem cells and the follicle structure as well as the blood vessels associated with the hair follicles express ND-GFP. The hair-follicle stem cells did not appear to be affected by doxorubicin, which may explain why hair regrows after chemotherapy. These results suggest that inhibition of hair-follicle-associated angiogenesis by doxorubicin may be an important factor in hair-follicle dystrophy associated with chemotherapy-induced alopecia. The ND-GFP mouse model is thus useful for the study of the role of angiogenesis in the hair-follicle cycle and the effect of drugs on processes associated with chemotherapy-induced alopecia.",

KO mice with a deletion of the M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M4R) present a striking hair phenotype, which we have analyzed here in greater detail by quantitative histomorphometry. Earlier studies revealed a retarded hair follicle morphogenesis in M4R KO mice, compared to age-matched wild type controls. On day 17, when mice enter the first hair growth cycle, the KO mice still showed a slightly retarded catagen phase. Subsequently, hair follicles of the KO mice stayed in a highly significantly prolonged telogen phase, while wild type mice had already far progressed in the hair cycle by entry into anagen. Most strikingly, the M4R KO mice did not engage in follicular melanogenesis and failed to produce pigmented hair shafts.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible stimulating mechanism of Huoxue Bushen Mixture (HXBSM), a traditional Chinese compound medicine, on hair growth of mice via measuring the variance of skin blood vessel neogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the hair follicle. METHODS: Hot rosin and paraffin mixture depilation were used to induce C57BL/6 mice hair follicle to enter from telogen into anagen. Ninety C57BL/6 mice were divided into 3 groups randomly: HXBSM group, Yangxue Shengfa Capsule (YXSFC, another traditional Chinese compound medicine) group and untreated group. The mice were fed with corresponding drugs after modeling. The hair growth of the mice was observed every day. Every ten mice out of each group were executed respectively at day 4, 11 and day 17. Skin blood vessel neogenesis was counted through pathological section and VEGF expression in the hair follicle was measured via immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: The number of local blood vessel neogenisis in the HXBSM group observed was larger than that in the untreated group at day 4 (P < 0. 05) ; and evidently larger than that in the YXSFC group and the untreated group at day 11 (P < 0. 05). The expression of VEGF in the hair follicle was distinctively higher than that in the YXSFC group and the untreated group at day 11 and day 17 (P < 0. 05).

Hair follicle regeneration involves epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (EMIs) of follicular epithelial and dermal papilla (DP) cells. Co-grafting of those cellular components from mice allows complete hair reconstitution. However, regeneration of human hair in a similar manner has not been reported. Here, we investigated the possibility of cell-based hair generation from human cells. We found that DP-enriched cells (DPE) are more critical than epidermal cells in murine hair reconstitution on a cell number basis, and that murine DPE are also competent for hair regeneration with rat epidermal cells. Co-grafting of human keratinocytes derived from neonatal foreskins with murine DPE produced hair follicle-like structures consisting of multiple epidermal cell layers with a well-keratinized innermost region. Those structures expressed hair follicle-specific markers including hair keratin, and markers expressed during developmental stages. However, the lack of regular hair structures indicates abnormal folliculogenesis. Similar hair follicle-like structures were also generated with cultured human keratinocytes after the first passage, or with keratinocytes derived from adult foreskins, demonstrating that epidermal cells even at a mature stage can differentiate in response to inductive signals from DP cells.

The cell surface marker CD34 marks mouse hair follicle bulge cells, which have attributes of stem cells, including quiescence and multipotency. Using a CD34 knockout (KO) mouse, we tested the hypothesis that CD34 may participate in tumor development in mice because hair follicle stem cells are thought to be a major target of carcinogens in the two-stage model of mouse skin carcinogenesis. Following initiation with 200 nmol 7, 12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA), mice were promoted with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 20 weeks. Under these conditions, CD34KO mice failed to develop papillomas. Increasing the initiating dose of DMBA to 400 nmol resulted in tumor development in the CD34KO mice, albeit with an increased latency and lower tumor yield compared with the wild-type (WT) strain. DNA adduct analysis of keratinocytes from DMBA-initiated CD34KO mice revealed that DMBA was metabolically activated into carcinogenic diol epoxides at both 200 and 400 nmol. Chronic exposure to TPA revealed that CD34KO skin developed and sustained epidermal hyperplasia. However, CD34KO hair follicles typically remained in telogen rather than transitioning into anagen growth, confirmed by retention of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled bulge stem cells within the hair follicle. Unique localization of the hair follicle progenitor cell marker MTS24 was found in interfollicular basal cells in TPA-treated WT mice, whereas staining remained restricted to the hair follicles of CD34KO mice, suggesting that progenitor cells migrate into epidermis differently between strains. These data show that CD34 is required for TPA-induced hair follicle stem cell activation and tumor formation in mice.",

    "text": "Transforming growth factor-beta receptor II is preferentially expressed in the companion layer of the human anagen hair follicle. BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is a multifunctional growth factor with multiple roles in skin including hair follicle development and cycling, where it regulates cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, as well as in wound healing. While TGF-beta receptor I (TGF-beta RI) and receptor II (TGF-beta RII) expression helps define early human hair follicle morphogenesis, expression in the adult human hair follicle remains to be established. OBJECTIVES: To assess TGF-beta receptor expression in human scalp anagen hair follicles. METHODS: Immunohistochemical and double immunofluorescence analysis of TGF-beta RI and RII was conducted on frozen sections of haired human scalp obtained from 10 healthy individuals. RESULTS: TGF-beta RI expression was detected in the outer root sheath of anagen hair follicles while TGF-beta RII was expressed almost exclusively in the companion layer of inner root sheath and less so in premedulla keratinocytes. Both receptors were colocalized in the companion layer of the proximal and mid follicle. CONCLUSIONS: The well-described role of TGF-beta in keratinocyte apoptosis during catagen is likely to involve anagen-specific hair follicle components including the companion layer, as this layer provides the slippage plane supporting the inner root sheath and hair shaft as they ascend to the skin surface. Results of this study suggest that the colocalization of TGF-beta RI/RII complexes at the companion layer would facilitate TGF-beta signalling at this site to regulate apoptosis of the companion layer keratinocytes, facilitating shrinkage/contraction of this cell layer during hair follicle regression/catagen.",

The homeostasis of both cornea and hair follicles depends on a constant supply of progeny cells produced by populations of keratin (K) 14-expressing stem cells localized in specific niches. To investigate the potential role of Co-factors of LIM domains (Clims) in epithelial tissues, we generated transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative Clim molecule (DN-Clim) under the control of the K14 promoter. As expected, the K14 promoter directed high level expression of the transgene to the basal cells of cornea and epidermis, as well as the outer root sheath of hair follicles. In corneal epithelium, the transgene expression causes decreased expression of adhesion molecule BP180 and defective hemidesmosomes, leading to detachment of corneal epithelium from the underlying stroma, which in turn causes blisters, wounds and an inflammatory response. After a period of epithelial thinning, the corneal epithelium undergoes differentiation to an epidermis-like structure. The K14-DN-Clim mice also develop progressive hair loss due to dysfunctional hair follicles that fail to generate hair shafts. The number of hair follicle stem cells is decreased by at least 60% in K14-DN-Clim mice, indicating that Clims are required for hair follicle stem cell maintenance. In addition, Clim2 interacts with Lhx2 in vivo, suggesting that Clim2 is an essential co-factor for the LIM homeodomain factor Lhx2, which was previously shown to play a role in hair follicle stem cell maintenance. Together, these data indicate that Clim proteins play important roles in the homeostasis of corneal epithelium and hair follicles.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of substance P (SP) on the migration and differentiation of epidermal stem cells (ESCs) to hair follicle, and its mechanism. METHODS: ESCs were cultured in vitro, and confirmed by positive staining of K19 and integrin beta1 with immunohistochemistry. SP was added into the culture of ESCs which were labelled with 5-BrdU, and the cell cultures were divided into control, 10 (-5) mol/L SP, 10 (-6) mol/L SP, and 10 (-7) mol/L SP groups according to the different doses of SP addition. Cell suspension (0. 3 ml) containing SP was injected into the dermis in the back of nude mice. Repeated injection of the equal amount of cell suspension in the same place was carried out on 4, 7, 10 and 14 days after first injection. The cells in control group received the same treatment but without SP. The skin specimens in the area of cell culture injection and the normal skin remote from cell injection were harvested for the histological examination and hair follicle counting by immunohistochemistry and electronmicroscope 28 days after injections. RESULTS: Hair follicles in scattered distribution were observed in 10 (-5) mol/L SP group, but some of them were defective in development. Hypoplasic hair follicle and a few hair follicles with distinct structure were observed in 10 (-5) mol/L SP group. Large amounts of hair follicles with distinct structure in deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue were observed in 10 (-6) mol/L SP, 10 (-7) mol/L SP groups, and some of them showed positive staining of brown BrdU in the hair root, and most of them showed positive staining of brown beta-catenin, but a few of them showed developmental defect. In contrast, hypoplasia of hair follicle underneath epidermis and deep layer of dermis with positive staining of brown BrdU and beta-catenin in epidermis were observed in control group. The number of hair follicles in 10 (-6) mol/L SP, 10 (-7) mol/L SP groups [(1. 9 +/-1. 2), (1. 3 +/-0. 8)] was obviously less than that in control group [(10. 5 +/-1. 2), P < 0. 01]. CONCLUSION: SP can induce ESCs to migrate from the basal layer into hair follicle, and this effect is dependent on the SP concentration. SP can also elevate the expression of beta-catenin in ESCs, which induces its differentiation to hair follicles.",

During embryonic and postnatal development, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is involved in several stages of hair morphogenesis from placode formation to hair shaft differentiation. Using a transgenic approach, we have investigated further the role of beta-catenin signaling in embryonic hair development. Forced epithelial stabilization of beta-catenin resulted in precocious and excessive induction of hair follicles even in the absence of Eda/Edar signaling, a pathway essential for primary hair placode formation. In addition, the spacing and size of the placodes was randomized. Surprisingly, the down-growth of follicles was suppressed and hair shaft production was severely impaired. Gene and reporter expression analyses revealed elevated mesenchymal Wnt activity, as well as increased BMP signaling, throughout the skin that was accompanied by upregulation of Sostdc1 (Wise, ectodin) expression. Our data suggest that BMPs are downstream of Wnt/beta-catenin and that their interplay may be a critical component in establishing correct patterning of hair follicles through the reaction-diffusion mechanism.",

Here we document that Runx2 has a regulatory role in skin and hair follicle development. The expression of Runx2 is restricted to hair follicles and is dynamic, pari passu with follicle development. Follicle maturation is delayed in the absence of Runx2 and overall skin and epidermal thickness of Runx2 null embryos is significantly reduced. The Runx2 null epidermis is hypoplastic, displaying reduced expression of Keratin 14, Keratin 1 and markers of proliferation. The expression pattern of Runx2 in the bulb epithelium of mature hair follicles is asymmetric and strikingly similar to that of Sonic hedgehog. This suggests that Runx2 may be a regulator of hedgehog signaling in skin as it is in bones and teeth. Supporting this possibility, we demonstrate that Sonic hedgehog, Patched1 and Gli1 transcripts are reduced in the skin of Runx2 null embryos. Moreover, we document Patched1 expression in epidermal basal cells and show that the skin of Sonic (+/-) embryos is thinner than that of wild-type littermates. These observations suggest that Runx2 and hedgehog signaling are involved in the well known, but unexplained, coupling of skin thickness to hair follicle development.",

The thrombin inhibitor protease nexin 1 [PN-1, also known as SERPINE2) regulates all those effects in vitro. Accordingly, the PI3K-Akt pathway is constitutively activated and expression of myofibroblastic marker smooth-muscle actin is enhanced in vivo in hair follicle dermal cells from PN-1 (-/-) mice. Furthermore, physiological PN-1 disappearance and upregulation of the thrombin receptor PAR-1 (also known as F2R) during follicular regression in wild-type mice also correlate with such changes in DP cell characteristics.

The infections were found to progress similarly in either anagen or telogen hair follicles, with bacilli occasionally invading deeper sites in anagen hair follicles. The infections progressed from the surface inward, rather than growing outward from within the follicles. Infecting bacilli destroyed the hair follicle keratinocytes and were initially not contacted by inflammatory cells within the follicles. However, at 3-4 days after inoculation, inflammatory cells did contact and disperse the massed follicle bacilli and led to apparent resolution of the follicle infections. Therefore, in this model system B. anthracis initially attacks superficial sites in active or inactive hair follicles and then progresses inward, producing destructive infections of the hair follicles ; these infections clear when the massed bacilli are eventually contacted and dispersed by inflammatory cells.",

In adult skin, epithelial hair follicle stem cells (SCs) reside in a quiescent niche and are essential for cyclic bouts of hair growth.

Here we show that slow-cycling cells appear early in skin development, express SC markers, and later give rise to the adult SC population. To test whether these early slow-cycling cells function as SCs, we use Sox9-Cre for genetic marking and K14-Cre to embryonically ablate Sox9, an essential adult SC gene. We find that the progeny of Sox9-expressing cells contribute to all skin epithelial lineages and Sox9 is required for SC specification.

We have previously shown that keratinocyte-specific deletion of Smad4, a TGFbeta/Activin/BMP signaling mediator, results in a progressive alopecia. To further assess the molecular mechanisms of Smad4 loss-mediated alopecia, we examined expression levels of key molecules associated with hair follicle differentiation in Smad4-deleted skin. Among them, Desmoglein 4 (Dsg4) was down-regulated in Smad4-deleted skin prior to the onset of hair follicle abnormalities with gradual depletion coinciding with hair follicle degeneration. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that Smad4, together with the BMP mediators Smad1 and Smad5, but not the TGFbeta/Activin mediators Smad2 or Smad3, bound to the Smad Binding Element (SBE) of the Dsg4 promoter. A Dsg4 reporter assay revealed that Smad4 was required for the maximal transactivation of Dsg4 in cooperation with Smad1 and Smad5. Mutating the SBE of the Dsg4 promoter abrogated Smad4 transactivation of Dsg4. Furthermore, BMP ligands, but not ligands of TGFbeta and Activin, induced endogenous Dsg4 expression. Our data demonstrate that in the presence of Smad4, BMP signaling participated in transcriptional regulation of Dsg4. Thus, Smad4 loss-associated Dsg4 depletion contributed, at least in part, to hair follicles degeneration in Smad4 deficient skin.",

The search for more effective drugs for the management of common hair growth disorders remains a top priority, both for clinical dermatology and industry.

The patented technique produces microdroplets, which generate human folliculoid microspheres (HFMs), consisting of human dermal papilla fibroblasts and outer root sheath keratinocytes within an extracellular matrix that simulates elements of the hair follicle mesenchyme. Studying a number of different markers (for example, proliferation, apoptosis, cytokeratin-6, versican), we show that these HFMs, cultured under well-defined conditions, retain several essential epithelial-mesenchymal interactions characteristic for human scalp hair follicle. Selected, recognized hair growth-modulatory agents modulate these parameters in a manner that suggests that HFMs allow the standardized preclinical assessment of test agents on relevant human hair growth markers under substantially simplified in vitro conditions that approximate the in vivo situation. Furthermore, we show by immunohistochemistry, reverse transcriptase-PCR, and DNA microarray techniques that HFMs also offer a useful discovery tool for the identification of target genes and their products for candidate hair drugs.

There are many diseases in which autologous urothelial and muscle cells cannot be used for in vitro construction of the urinary bladder wall for augmentation (cystoplasty). These diseases are the most frequent indications for bladder augmentation. The present paper focuses on the idea of harvesting potentially multipotent stem cells out of hair follicles in order to use them for regeneration of the urinary bladder wall. Current clinical practice suggests the use of cultures enriched with progenitors. The hair follicle stem cell niche gives an opportunity to reduce the invasiveness of harvesting these cells. Both epithelial and dermal multipotent stem cells populations within hair follicles raise new possibilities for tissue engineering of the urinary bladder.

The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle implicated as an essential component of a number of signaling pathways. It is present on cells throughout the mammalian body ; however, its functions in most tissues remain largely unknown. Herein we demonstrate that primary cilia are present on cells in murine skin and hair follicles throughout morphogenesis and during hair follicle cycling in postnatal life. Using the Cre-lox system, we disrupted cilia assembly in the ventral dermis and evaluated the effects on hair follicle development. Mice with disrupted dermal cilia have severe hypotrichosis (lack of hair) in affected areas. Histological analyses reveal that most follicles in the mutants arrest at stage 2 of hair development and have small or absent dermal condensates. This phenotype is reminiscent of that seen in the skin of mice lacking Shh or Gli2. In situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicates that the hedgehog pathway is downregulated in the dermis of the cilia mutant hair follicles. Thus, these data establish cilia as a critical signaling component required for normal hair morphogenesis and suggest that this organelle is needed on cells in the dermis for reception of signals such as sonic hedgehog.",

The cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin M/E is a key regulator of a biochemical pathway that leads to epidermal terminal differentiation by inhibition of its target proteases cathepsin L, cathepsin V, and legumain. Inhibition of cathepsin L is important in the cornification process of the skin, as we have recently demonstrated that cathepsin L is the elusive processing and activating protease for transglutaminase 3, an enzyme that is responsible for crosslinking of structural proteins in cornified envelope formation. Here, we study the localization of all players of this pathway in the human hair follicle and nail unit in order to elucidate their possible role in the biology of these epidermal appendages. We found that cathepsin L and transglutaminase 3 specifically colocalize in the hair bulb and the nail matrix, the regions that provide cells that terminally differentiate to the hair fiber and the nail plate, respectively. Furthermore, transglutaminase 3 also colocalizes with the structural proteins loricrin and involucrin, which are established transglutaminase substrates.

    "text": "\" Analyses of regenerative wave patterns in adult hair follicle populations reveal macro-environmental regulation of stem cell activity. The control of hair growth in the adult mammalian coat is a fascinating topic which has just begun to be explored with molecular genetic tools. Complex hair cycle domains and regenerative hair waves are present in normal adult (> 2 month) mice, but more apparent in mutants with cyclic alopecia phenotypes. Each hair cycle domain consists of initiation site (s), a propagating wave and boundaries. By analyzing the dynamics of hair growth, time required for regeneration after plucking, in situ hybridization and reporter activity, we showed that there is oscillation of intra-follicular Wnt signaling which is synchronous with hair cycling, and there is oscillation of dermal bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling which is asynchronous with hair cycling. The interactions of these two rhythms lead to the recognition of refractory and competent phases in the telogen, and autonomous and propagating phases in the anagen. Boundaries form when propagating anagen waves reach follicles which are in refractory telogen. Experiments showed that Krt14-Nog mice have shortened refractory telogen and simplified wave dynamics. Krt14-Nog skin grafts exhibit non-autonomous interactions with surrounding host skin. Implantation of BMP coated beads into competent telogen skin prevents hair wave propagation around the bead. Thus, we have developed a new molecular understanding of the classic early concepts of inhibitory \" \" chalone \" \", suggesting that stem cells within the hair follicle micro-environment, or other organs, are subject to a higher level of macro-environmental regulation. Such a novel understanding has important implications in the field of regenerative medicine.

Previous studies suggested that Group I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors play a role in mechanotransduction processes of slowly adapting type I mechanoreceptors. Using an isolated rat sinus hair follicle preparation we tested a range of compounds. Surprisingly, only non-competitive mGlu1 receptor antagonists produced profound and long-lasting depression of mechanically evoked firing. 6-Amino-N-cyclohexyl-N, 3-dimethylthiazolo [3, 2-alpha] benzimidazole-2-carboxamide hydrochloride (YM-298198) had an IC (50) of 8. 7 muM (95% CI 5. 7 to 13. 2 microM), representing the most potent known blocker of type I mechanoreceptors. The derivative 6-amino-N-cyclohexyl-3-methylthiazolo [3, 2-alpha] benzimidazole-2-carboxamide hydrochloride (desmethyl YM-298198) had a comparable potency. Another compound 7-(hydroxyimino) cyclopropa [b] chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOEt) had a similar depressant effect, although it was less potent with an approximate IC (50) of 100 microM. Between three and seven times the concentration of CPCCOEt and YM-298198 respectively was required to produce similar depressions in slowly adapting type II units. No depression, and some weak excitatory effects, were observed using the following ligands: the competitive mGlu1 receptor antagonist alpha-amino-5-carboxy-3-methyl-2-thiopheneacetic acid (3-MATIDA) (300 microM), the phosphoserine phosphatase inhibitor dl-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (dl-AP3) (2 mM), non-competitive mGlu5 receptor antagonists 3-((2-methyl-1, 3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl) pyridine ; (S)-3, 5-DHPG, (S)-3, 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (MTEP) (10 microM) and 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP) (100 microM), the mGlu1 receptor agonist (S)-3, 5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ((S)-3, 5-DHPG) (500 microM), and the mGlu5 receptor agonist (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) (1 mM). The results suggest that the non-competitive mGlu1 receptor antagonists are not acting at conventional mGlu1 receptors but at other binding sites, possibly those directly associated with mechanogated channels or on any of a number of indirect biochemical pathways. YM-298198 and related compounds may prove to be useful ligands to identify mechanosensitive channel proteins. The selective interference of type I units may provide further evidence that Merkel cells are mechanotransducers. Finally such compounds may deliver insights or treatments for Merkel cell carcinoma.",

At 1 week after the transplantation and then on a monthly basis in the following 6 months, full-thickness skin tissues were sampled at the site of grafting to evaluate the histocompatibility of the matrix material using HE staining and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: At 1 week after implantation of the matrix material, a small number of inflammatory cells and lymphocytic infiltration were observed around the graft, with mild hyperemia in the proliferative capillaries and mild inflammatory responses. In the following 6 months, the inflammatory cells and lymphocytes around the graft decreased obviously or even disappeared, and such graft rejection responses as tissue lysis and necrosis were not observed.

    "text": "Hair follicle renewal: authentic morphogenesis that depends on a complex progression of stem cell lineages. The hair follicle (HF) grows during the anagen phase from precursors in the matrix that give rise to each differentiated HF layer. Little is known about the lineal relationship between these layer-restricted precursors and HF stem cells. To understand how the HF stem cells regenerate the typical anagen organization, we conducted in vivo clonal analysis of key stages of the HF cycle in mice. Unexpectedly, we found that the pool of HF stem cells contains precursors with both multipotent and restricted contributions. This implies that the lineal relationships between HF stem cells (persisting during telogen) and layer-restricted precursors (in the germinative layer), responsible for HF elongation during anagen, are not stereotyped. Formation of the matrix at each cycle is accompanied by the transient expansion of an intermediary pool of precursors at the origin of the germinative layer and by the progressive restriction of cell dispersion. The regionalization of clonal patterns within the outer HF structure (the outer root sheath) suggests that the position of the precursors might be a crucial factor in determining their fate. The presence of HF stem cells with multipotent contribution and the progressive segregation of HF lineages upon anagen activation indicate that each HF renewal cycle constitutes an authentic morphogenetic process. A comprehensive model was constructed based on the different clonal patterns observed. In this model, the positions of the precursors relative to the dermal papilla together with the progressive restriction of cell dispersion are part of the mechanism that restricts their contribution to the different HF lineages.",

Systems biology studies how the components of a biological system (e. g. genes, transcripts, proteins, metabolites) interact to bring about defined biological function or dysfunction. Living systems may be divided into five dimensions of complexity: (i) molecular ; (ii) structural ; (iii) temporal ; (iv) abstraction and emergence ; and (v) algorithmic. Understanding the details of these dimensions in living systems is the challenge that systems biology aims to address. Here, we argue that the hair follicle (HF), one of the signature features of mammals, is a perfect and clinically relevant model for systems biology research. The HF represents a stem cell-rich, essentially autonomous mini-organ, whose cyclic transformations follow a hypothetical intrafollicular \" \" hair cycle clock \" \" (HCC). This prototypic neuroectodermal-mesodermal interaction system, at the cross-roads of systems and chronobiology, encompasses various levels of complexity as it is subject to both intrafollicular and extrafollicular inputs (e. g. intracutaneous timing mechanisms with neural and systemic stimuli). Exploring how the cycling HF addresses the five dimensions of living systems, we argue that a systems biology approach to the study of hair growth and cycling, in man and mice, has great translational medicine potential.

HFSCs were isolated from transgenic mice, amplified by clonal expansion on a 3T3 feeder layer, and transplanted on a fibrin carrier to the eye of LSCD wild-type mice (n = 31). The HFSC transplant was able to reconstruct the ocular surface in 80% of the transplanted animals ; differentiating into cells with a corneal epithelial phenotype, expressing Krt12, and repopulating the corneal SC pool while suppressing vascularization and conjunctival ingrowth.

In this study, we aimed at engineering the vascular media using HF-SMCs and a natural biomaterial, namely small intestinal submucosa (SIS).

Within 2 weeks in culture, the cells migrated into SIS and secreted collagen and elastin, the two major extracellular matrix components of the vessel wall. At 2 weeks, vascular reactivity increased significantly up to three-to fivefold and mechanical properties were similar to those of native ovine arteries.

AIMS: Differential diagnosis between the group of trichoadenoma, trichofolliculoma, trichoepithelioma, trichoblastoma and basal cell carcinoma has been creating some difficulties for the pathologist and the clinicians, particularly in the presence of small specimens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 30 cases of benign tumours of cutaneous appendages originating from the hair follicle and 30 cases of basal cell carcinoma were retrieved from the archives deposited from 2004 to 2008. RESULTS: The expression of CD10 in both tumours was graded from [0] to [2 +] for each case. The immunoreactivity of CD10 was comparatively examined among the groups and each subgroup. The stromal CD10 immunopositivity of benign tumours of cutaneous appendages originating from the hair follicle was stronger than the other (p = 0. 003) regarding both the numerical and the degree of expression. However, peripheral CD10 of basal cell carcinoma was stronger than the other for [1 +] immunopositivity (p = 0. 03). It was exact opposite for [2 +] (p = 0. 013). Besides, central CD10 immunopositivity and CD10 reactivity for the subgroups was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: CD10 may be very useful for the differential diagnosis between them particularly in the small and superficial biopsies and it may be even a life-saving method in some selected cases.",

Runx1 acts in the embryonic epithelium for timely emergence of adult HFSCs and short-term progenitors, but is dispensable for both of them. In contrast, Runx1 is strictly needed in the embryonic mesenchyme for proper adult HFSC differentiation and long-term skin integrity. Our data implicate Runx1 in epithelial cell adhesion and migration and in regulation of paracrine epithelial-mesenchymal cross talk.

Uncontrolled Hedgehog (Hh) signaling leads to the development of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the most common human cancer, but the cell of origin for BCC is unclear. While Hh pathway dysregulation is common to essentially all BCCs, there exist multiple histological subtypes, including superficial and nodular variants, raising the possibility that morphologically distinct BCCs may arise from different cellular compartments in skin. Here we have shown that induction of a major mediator of Hh signaling, GLI2 activator (GLI2DeltaN), selectively in stem cells of resting hair follicles in mice, induced nodular BCC development from a small subset of cells in the lower bulge and secondary hair germ compartments. Tumorigenesis was markedly accelerated when GLI2DeltaN was induced in growing hair follicles. In contrast, induction of GLI2DeltaN in epidermis led to the formation of superficial BCCs. Expression of GLI2DeltaN at reduced levels in mice yielded lesions resembling basaloid follicular hamartomas, which have previously been linked to low-level Hh signaling in both mice and humans. Our data show that the cell of origin, tissue context (quiescent versus growing hair follicles), and level of oncogenic signaling can determine the phenotype of Hh/Gli-driven skin tumors, with high-level signaling required for development of superficial BCC-like tumors from interfollicular epidermis and nodular BCC-like tumors from hair follicle stem cells.",

Therefore, accessible, instructive, and clinically relevant human in vitro models are needed for exploring the general principles of why and how IP collapses under clinically relevant experimental conditions and how it can be protected or even restored therapeutically. Among the few human IP sites, the easily accessible and abundantly available hair follicle (HF) may offer one such surrogate model. There are excellent human HF organ culture systems for the study of HF IP in situ that instructively complement in vivo autoimmunity research in the human system. In this article, we delineate that the human eye and HF, despite their obvious differences, share key molecular and cellular mechanisms for maintaining IP.

    "text": "Skin regeneration with conical and hair follicle structure of deep second-degree scalding injuries via combined expression of the EPO receptor and beta common receptor by local subcutaneous injection of nanosized rhEPO. BACKGROUND: Acceleration of skin regeneration is still an unsolved problem in the clinical treatment of patients suffering from deep burns and scalds. Although erythropoietin (EPO) has a protective role in a wide range of organs and cells during ischemia and after trauma, it has been recently discovered that EPO is not tissue-protective in the common beta subunit receptor (betaCR) knockout mouse. The protective capacity of EPO in tissue is mediated via a heteroreceptor complex comprising both the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and betaCR. However, proof of coexpression of these heterogenic receptors in regenerating skin after burns is still lacking. METHODS: To understand the role of nanosized recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) in wound healing, we investigated the effects of subcutaneous injections of EPO on skin regeneration after deep second-degree scalding injuries. Our aim was to determine if joint expression of EPOR and betaCR is a prerequisite for the tissue-protective effect of rhEPO. The efficiency in wound regeneration in a skin scalding injury mouse model was examined. A deep second-degree dermal scald injury was produced on the backs of 20 female Balb/c mice which were subsequently randomized to four experimental groups, two of which received daily subcutaneous injections of rhEPO. At days 7 and 14, the mice were sacrificed and the effects of rhEPO were analyzed with respect to grade of re-epithelialization (wound closure) and stage of epidermal maturation. This was investigated using different histological parameters of epithelial covering, such as depth of the epidermal layer, epidermal stratification, and presence of conical and hair follicle structures. RESULTS: Expression of EPOR, betaCR, and growth hormone receptor at the mRNA and protein levels was demonstrated with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. After rhEPO treatment, the rate of re-epithelialization of the scalding injury was increased and the time to final wound closure was reduced. In addition, the quality of regenerated skin was improved. In this investigation, for the first time, we demonstrated coexpression of EPOR and betaCR at the RNA and protein levels in vivo using a deep second-degree scalding injury mouse model. These results highlight the potential role of rhEPO in the improved treatment of burns patients, which might be crucial for the development of innovative new therapy regimes. CONCLUSION: Local injection of nanosized rhEPO directly to the injury site rather than systemic administration for deep second-degree scalding injuries achieved complete skin regeneration with conical and hair follicle structure via combined expression of EPOR and betaCR.",

The hair follicle system represents a tractable model for the study of stem cell behaviour in regenerative adult epithelial tissue. However, although there are numerous spatial scales of observation (molecular, cellular, follicle and multi follicle), it is not yet clear what mechanisms underpin the follicle growth cycle. In this study we seek to address this problem by describing how the growth dynamics of a large population of follicles can be treated as a classical excitable medium. Defining caricature interactions at the molecular scale and treating a single follicle as a functional unit, a minimal model is proposed in which the follicle growth cycle is an emergent phenomenon. Expressions are derived, in terms of parameters representing molecular regulation, for the time spent in the different functional phases of the cycle, a formalism that allows the model to be directly compared with a previous cellular automaton model and experimental measurements made at the single follicle scale. A multi follicle model is constructed and numerical simulations are used to demonstrate excellent qualitative agreement with a range of experimental observations. Notably, the excitable medium equations exhibit a wider family of solutions than the previous work and we demonstrate how parameter changes representing altered molecular regulation can explain perturbed patterns in Wnt over-expression and BMP down-regulation mouse models. Further experimental scenarios that could be used to test the fundamental premise of the model are suggested. The key conclusion from our work is that positive and negative regulatory interactions between activators and inhibitors can give rise to a range of experimentally observed phenomena at the follicle and multi follicle spatial scales and, as such, could represent a core mechanism underlying hair follicle growth.",

INTRODUCTION: There are major new advancements in the fields of stem cell biology, developmental biology, regenerative hair cycling, and tissue engineering. The time is ripe to integrate, translate, and apply these findings to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Readers will learn about new progress in cellular and molecular aspects of hair follicle development, regeneration, and potential therapeutic opportunities these advances may offer. AREAS COVERED: Here, we use hair follicle formation to illustrate this progress and to identify targets for potential strategies in therapeutics. Hair regeneration is discussed in four different categories: i) Intra-follicle regeneration (or renewal) is the basic production of hair fibers from hair stem cells and dermal papillae in existing follicles. ii) Chimeric follicles via epithelial-mesenchymal recombination to identify stem cells and signaling centers. iii) Extra-follicular factors including local dermal and systemic factors can modulate the regenerative behavior of hair follicles, and may be relatively easy therapeutic targets. iv) Follicular neogenesis means the de novo formation of new follicles.

Hair follicle reconstitution models are useful tools for investigating signalling and cytokines during hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling. The chamber model is one of the most established methods available for the study of hair follicle reconstitution and appears to be the most reproducible. However, the chamber model has several deficiencies: infection of skin wounds and subsequent animal death commonly occur, a large number of cells are required and only one chamber can be transplanted onto each animal. We modified these deficiencies by using a mini-chamber method, which has the advantages of having a high graft take rate, requiring fewer cells and allowing several mini-chambers to be transplanted onto each animal. In our study, cultured dermal cells at different passages (0 to high) lost the ability to reconstruct hair follicles, but dermal cells cultured overnight (12 h) retained this ability. Using the assay, newborn mice dermal cells that were freshly isolated and cultured overnight (12 h), as well as cultured dermal papilla cells from mice vibrissa follicles, all reconstructed hair follicles.

BACKGROUND: Sweat glands (SGs) can not regenerate after complete destruction in the severe skin injury, so it is important to find a ideal stem cell source in order to regenerate functional SGs. Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) possess the obvious properties of the adult stem cells, which are multipotent and easily accessible. In this research, we attempted to direct the HFSCs suffered from the sweat gland cells (SGCs) special differentiation by a co-operative coculture system in vitro. METHODS: The designed co-culture microenvironment in the transwell was consist of two critial factors: heat shocked SGCs and dermis-like mesenchymal tissue, which appeared independently in the two control groups ; after induction, the purified induced SGC-like cells were transplanted into the full-thickness scalded wounds of the nude mice, after 4 weeks, the reconstructed SG-like structures were identified by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis. RESULTS: A part of HFSCs in experimental group finally expressed SGCs phenotypes, by contrast, the control group 1 which just containing dermis-like mesenchymal tissue failed and the control group 2 consisted of heat shocked SGCs was in a poor efficiency ; by immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis, the expression of HFSCs special biomarkers was down regulated, instead of the positive efficiency of SGCs special antigens increased ; besides, the induced SGCs displayed a high expression of ectodysplasin A (EDA) and ectodysplasin A receptor (EDAR) genes and proteins ; after cell transplantation, the youngest SG-like structures formed and be positive in SGCs special antigens, which never happened in untreated wounds (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The HFSCs are multipotential and capable in differentiating into SGCs which promise a potential stem cells reservoir for future use ; our special co-culture microenvironment is promising for HFSCs differentiating ; the induced SGCs are functional and could work well in the regeneration of SGs.",

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The bulge region of hair follicle has been reported as a putative reservoir of hair follicle stem cells. The purpose of this study was to compare hair follice CD34 negative (CD34-) cell with CD34 positive (CD34 +) cell and to evaluate the ability to regenerate new hair of immunodeficient nude mouse. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this report, we isolated the cells with CD34, known as bulge-negative cell surface marker from cultured human hair follicle cells using by magnetic cell sorting (MACS), injected the cells to immunodeficient nude mouse. To determine immunological characterization, human hair follicle CD34 + cells and CD34-cells were assessed by flow cytometry. The localization of injected-CD34 + cells was assessed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse skin samples by in situ hybridization technique. Our findings show that the human hair follicle cells with cell surface marker CD34 were located in the outer root sheath of nude mouse after transplantation and the cells were able to regenerate new hair follicle in immunodeficient nude mouse. CD34-cells also were able to regenerate follicles in the mouse, however, CD34 + cells were able to regenerate much more hair follicle than CD34-cells. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the results of this study add new insight into the investigation of CD34 stem cell-related molecule in human hair follicles and suggest that not all human hair follicle stem cells reside in bulge region, but in a lager niche.",

    "text": "Principles and mechanisms of regeneration in the mouse model for wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis. Wound induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN) describes a regenerative phenomenon in adult mammalian skin, wherein fully functional hair follicles regenerate de novo in the center of large excisional wounds. Originally described in rats, rabbits, sheep, and humans in 1940-60, the WIHN phenomenon was reinvestigated in mice only recently. The process of de novo hair regeneration largely duplicates the morphological and signaling features of normal embryonic hair development. Similar to hair development, WIHN critically depends on the activation of canonical WNT signaling. However, unlike hair development, WNT activation in WIHN is dependent on Fgf9 signaling generated by the immune system ' s gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells. The cellular bases of WIHN remain to be fully characterized, however, the available evidence leaves open the possibility for a blastema-like mechanism, wherein epidermal and/or dermal wound cells undergo epigenetic reprogramming toward a more plastic, embryonic-like state. De novo hair follicles do not regenerate from preexisting hair-fated bulge stem cells. This suggests that hair neogenesis is not driven by preexisting lineage-restricted progenitors, as is the case for amputation-induced mouse digit tip regeneration, but rather may require a blastema-like mechanism. The WIHN model is characterized by several intriguing features, which await further explanation. These include: (i) minimum wound size requirement for activating neogenesis, (ii) restriction of hair neogenesis to the wound ' s center, (iii) imperfect patterning outcomes, both in terms of neogenic hair positioning within the wound and in terms of their orientation. Future inquires into the WIHN process, made possible by a wide array of the available skin-specific genetic tools, will undoubtedly expand our understanding of the regeneration mechanisms in adult mammals.",

R-spondin proteins are novel Wnt/beta-catenin agonists, which signal through their receptors leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor (LGR) 4/5/6 and substantially enhance Wnt/beta-catenin activity. R-spondins are reported to function in embryonic development. They also play important roles in stem cell functions in adult tissues, such as the intestine and mammary glands, which largely rely on Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. However, in the skin epithelium and hair follicles, the information about R-spondins is deficient, although the expressions and functions of their receptors, LGR4/5/6, have already been studied in detail. In the present study, highly-enriched expression of the R-spondin family genes (Rspo1/2/3/4) in the hair follicle dermal papilla is revealed. Expression of Rspo1 in the dermal papilla is specifically and prominently upregulated before anagen entry, and exogenous recombinant R-spondin1 protein injection in mid-telogen leads to precocious anagen entry. Moreover, R-spondin1 activates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cultured bulge stem cells in vitro, changing their fate determination without altering the cell proliferation. Our pioneering study uncovers a role of R-spondin1 in the activation of cultured hair follicle stem cells and the regulation of hair cycle progression, shedding new light on the governance of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in skin biology and providing helpful clues for future treatment of hair follicle disorders.",

It is well recognized that regulating the hair follicle cycle in association with Wnt signaling is one of the most interesting targets for promoting hair regrowth. In this study, we examined whether selected herbal medicines processed by decoction and fermentation promote hair growth by upregulating the number and size of hair follicles and Wnt signaling, including activation of beta-catenin and Akt in telogen-synchronized C57BL/6N mice. The results revealed that the fermented extract after decoction (FDE) more effectively promoted hair growth than that of a nonfermented extract (DE). Notably, FDE effectively enhanced formation of hair follicles with clearer differentiation between the inner and outer root sheath, which is observed during the anagen phase. Mechanistic evidence was found for increased beta-catenin and Akt phosphorylation levels in dorsal skin tissue along with elevated expression of hair regrowth-related genes, such as Wnt3/10a/10b, Lef1, and fibroblast growth factor 7.

    "text": "CD133-positive dermal papilla-derived Wnt ligands regulate postnatal hair growth. Active Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the dermal papilla (DP) is required for postnatal hair cycling. In addition, maintenance of the hair-inducing ability of DP cells in vitro requires external addition of Wnt molecules. However, whether DP cells are a critical source of Wnt ligands and induce both autocrine and paracrine signaling cascades to promote adult hair follicle growth and regeneration remains elusive. To address this question, we generated an animal model that allows inducible ablation of Wntless (Wls), a transmembrane Wnt exporter protein, in CD133-positive (CD133 +) DP cells. CD133 + cells have been shown to be a specific subpopulation of cells in the DP, which possesses the hair-inducing capability. Here, we show that ablation of Wls expression in CD133 + DP cells results in a shortened period of postnatal hair growth. Mutant hair follicles were unable to enter full anagen (hair growth stage) and progressed toward a rapid regression. Notably, reduced size of the DP and decreased expression of anagen DP marker, versican, were observed in hair follicles when CD133 + DP cells lost Wls expression. Further analysis showed that Wls-deficient CD133 + DP cells led to reduced proliferation and differentiation in matrix keratinocytes and melanocytes that are needed for the generation of the hair follicle structure and a pigmented hair shaft. These findings clearly demonstrate that Wnt ligands produced by CD133 + DP cells play an important role in postnatal hair growth by maintaining the inductivity of DP cells and mediating the signaling cross-talk between the mesenchyme and the epithelial compartment.",

As a consequence, in vitro models of these cells are widely used to study the molecular mechanisms which underlie hair follicle induction, growth and maintenance. While dermal papilla from rodent hair follicles can be digested prior to cell isolation, the unique extracellular matrix composition found in human dermal papilla renders enzymes such as trypsin and collagenase insufficient for digestion of the dermal papilla into a single cell suspension. As such, to grow human dermal papilla cells in vitro, the papilla has to first be isolated via a micro-dissection approach from the follicle.

SOX family proteins SOX2 and SOX18 have been reported as being essential in determining hair follicle type ; however, the role they play during development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Sox18 regulates the normal differentiation of the dermal papilla of all hair types. In guard (primary) hair dermal condensate (DC) cells, we identified transient Sox18 in addition to SOX2 expression at E14. 5, which allowed fate tracing of primary DC cells until birth. Similarly, expression of Sox18 was detected in the DC cells of secondary hairs at E16. 5 and in tertiary hair at E18. 5. Dominant-negative Sox18 mutation (opposum) did not prevent DC formation in any hair type. However, it affected dermal papilla differentiation, restricting hair formation especially in secondary and tertiary hairs. This Sox18 mutation also prevented neonatal dermal cells or dermal papilla spheres from inducing hair in regeneration assays. Microarray expression studies identified WNT5A and TNC as potential downstream effectors of SOX18 that are important for epidermal WNT signalling. In conclusion, SOX18 acts as a mesenchymal molecular switch necessary for the formation and function of the dermal papilla in all hair types.",

Utilizing diphtheria-toxin-mediated cell ablation of Lgr5 + (leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5) stem cells, we show that killing of Lgr5 + cells in mice abrogates hair regeneration but this is reversible. During recovery, CD34 + (CD34 antigen) stem cells activate inflammatory response programs and start dividing. Pharmacological attenuation of inflammation inhibits CD34 + cell proliferation. Subsequently, the Wnt pathway controls the recovery of Lgr5 + cells and inhibition of Wnt signalling prevents Lgr5 + cell and hair germ recovery.

BACKGROUND: Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor, increases the intracellular level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate to cause vasodilation. Topical application of cilostazol is reported to improve local blood flow and enhance wound healing ; however, its effect on human hair follicles is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of cilostazol on hair growth. METHODS: We investigated the expression of PDE3 in human dermal papilla cells (DPCs), outer root sheath cells (ORSCs), and hair follicles. The effects of cilostazol on DPC and ORSC proliferation were evaluated using BrdU and WST-1 assays. The expression of various growth factors in DPCs was investigated by growth factor antibody array. Additionally, hair shaft elongation was measured using ex vivo hair follicle organ cultures, and anagen induction was evaluated in C57BL/6 mice. Finally, the effects of cilostazol on vessel formation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway were evaluated. RESULTS: We confirmed high mRNA and protein expression of PDE3 in human DPCs. Cilostazol not only enhanced the proliferation of human DPCs but also regulated the secretion of several growth factors responsible for hair growth. Furthermore, it promoted hair shaft elongation ex vivo, with increased proliferation of matrix keratinocytes. Cilostazol also accelerated anagen induction by stimulating vessel formation and upregulating the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and P38 after its topical application in C57BL/6 mice. CONCLUSION: Our results show that cilostazol promotes hair growth and may serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of alopecia.",

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression patterns of the markers called cytokeratin 15 (K15), cytokeratin 6 (K6) and monoclonal antibody Ki-67, and also apoptosis in HFs, which can be observed in different parts of the human body. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, healthy human HFs were taken by biopsy from 5 various donor sites of the human body: the scalp, the leg, the abdomen, the back and waist. HF-containing skin specimens taken using cryosection were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H & E) and K15, K6, Ki-67 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dNTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) immunofluorescence staining protocol was performed. RESULTS: Different skin regions from the human body were examined histologically. While the HFs of scalp tissue showed anatomically obvious hair layers, some hair sections from other regions, like the leg, the abdomen, back and waist, were not as distinct as in the scalp region. According to our findings, K15 expression was highest in the scalp. In addition, the immunoreactivity (IR) intensity of K15 was significantly decreased in the HFs on the waist and abdominal regions, compared to the scalp and back regions (p < 0. 001). However, the IR intensity of K6 in the scalp region was statistically significantly higher than the IR intensity of K6 in the abdomen region (p < 0. 05). Moreover, we showed intraepithelial apoptosis and proliferation of keratinocytes in the bulge of HF. In the study, Ki-67-positive and TUNEL-positive cell numbers were not statistically significant (p > 0. 05).

As a result, we found that the vibrissae follicle growth was accelerated by 10 ng/mL Activin B in the anagen induction assay and in an organ culture model. 10 ng/mL Activin B promoted hair matrix cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, Activin B modulates hair matrix cell growth through the ERK-Elk1 signaling pathway, and Activin B accelerates hair matrix cell transition from the G1/G0 phase to the S phase through the ERK-Cyclin D1 signaling pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Activin B may promote mouse vibrissae growth by stimulating hair matrix cell proliferation and cell cycle progression through ERK signaling.",

BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an innovative treatment of androgenic alopecia in the early stages of development, and its mechanism of action is not well investigated. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the promotion of hair growth by activated PRP supernatant in cultured dermal papilla cells (DPCs). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human DPCs were isolated and grown in culture with or without activated PRP supernatant. The expression of phosphorylated growth factor receptors (GFRs) in cultured DPCs was assayed by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Signal pathways mediated by GFRs were identified by a human phosphokinase array. RESULTS: Activated PRP supernatant enhanced the expression of phosphorylated fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-1, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha, and PDGFRbeta in cultured DPCs. Activated PRP supernatant activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways that promoted proliferation of DPCs. Downregulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 was consistent with the involvement of Wnt signaling. Activated PRP supernatant increased the hair growth promoting ability of DPCs by activating the Wnt signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Autologous activated PRP supernatant promoted signaling in cultured human DPCs via pathways known to be involved in hair growth. The results warrant further study of PRP for the clinical treatment of androgenic alopecia.",

Adiponectin (APN), released mainly from adipose tissue, is a well-known homeostatic factor for regulating glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. A recent study showed that human hair follicles express APN receptors and the presence of APN-mediated hair growth signaling, thereby suggesting that APN is a potent hair growth-promoting adipokine. Previously, kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives (KCEDs) were synthesized in our institute as new anti-aging or adiponectin-/adipogenesis-inducing compounds. Here, we tested the activity of these derivatives to induce endogenous APN secretion. Among the derivatives, KCED-1 and KCED-2 showed improved activity in inducing APN mRNA expression, secretion of APN protein, and adipogenesis in human subcutaneous fat cells (hSCFs) when compared with the effects of Seletinoid G, a verified APN inducer. When human follicular dermal papilla cells were treated with the culture supernatant of KCED-1-or KCED-2-treated hSCFs, the mRNA expression of APN-induced hair growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor was upregulated compared with that in the control. Taken together, our study shows that among kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives, KCED-1, KCED-2, as well as Seletinoid G are effective inducers of endogenous APN production in subcutaneous fat tissues, which may in turn contribute to the promotion of hair growth in the human scalp.",

Eccrine sweat glands and hair follicles are two primary skin appendages that serve different functions. Although the two appendages exhibit unique morphological patterns in adults, it is difficult to distinguish them morphologically in the early stages of development and regeneration. To research and compare the development, differentiation and regeneration between eccrine sweat glands and hair follicles/pilosebaceous units, specific antigen markers must be found first. Human skin samples were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and cut. The expression of K5, K7, K8, K14, K27, K31, K73, AE13, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Na +/K +-ATPase alpha and Na +-K +-2Cl cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) in eccrine sweat glands, hair follicles and sebaceous glands was detected by immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that eccrine sweat glands expressed K5, K7, K8, K14, K31, alpha-SMA, CEA, EMA, Na +/K +-ATPase alpha and NKCC1, but did not express K27, K73 or K31. Hair follicles expressed K5, K8, K14, K27, K31, K73, alpha-SMA and AE13, but did not express K7, CEA, Na +/K +-ATPase alpha or NKCC1. Sebaceous glands expressed K5, K14, K73, and EMA, but did not express K7, K8, K31, alpha-SMA, CEA, EMA, Na +/K +-ATPase alpha or NKCC1. We concluded that K7, CEA, Na +/K +-ATPase and NKCC1 can be used as specific markers for eccrine sweat glands, K27 and AE13 can be used as specific markers for hair follicles, and K73 can be used as a specific marker for pilosebaceous unit.

Hair plays important roles, ranging from the conservation of body heat to the preservation of psychological well-being. Hair loss or alopecia affects millions worldwide, but methods that can be used to regrow hair are lacking.

Stimulation of hair growth by these agents is blocked by specific autophagy inhibitors, suggesting a mechanistic link between autophagy and hair regeneration. Consistently, increased autophagy is detected upon anagen entry during the natural hair follicle cycle, and oral alpha-KB prevents hair loss in aged mice.

    "text": "Deciphering the molecular morphology of the human hair cycle: Wnt signalling during the telogen-anagen transformation. BACKGROUND: The signals that induce anagen (growth) in ' quiescent ' human telogen hair follicles (HFs) are as yet unknown. Their identification promises better targeted therapeutic hair growth interventions. OBJECTIVES: Recognizing the central role of Wnt signalling in hair biology, the aim was to delineate the differential expression of key agonists, antagonists and target genes of this pathway during the telogen-to-anagen transformation of human scalp HFs. METHODS: This differential expression was studied by in situ hybridization in human telogen and early-anagen scalp HF sections. RESULTS: On anagen induction, gene expression of the Wnt ligands WNT3, WNT4 and WNT10B, the Wnt ligand secretion regulator WLS, and the Wnt target genes AXIN2 and LEF1, is significantly increased within the secondary hair germ and the dermal papilla. Conversely, expression of the secreted Wnt inhibitor SFRP1 (secreted frizzled-related protein 1) is reduced. Human epithelial HF stem cells upregulate WNT4 and WNT10A expression, suggesting that these Wnt agonists are important for stem cell activation. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first evidence that key changes in Wnt signalling that drive murine anagen induction also occur in human scalp HFs, yet with notable differences. This provides a rational basis for Wnt-targeting therapeutic interventions to manipulate human hair growth disorders. What ' s already known about this topic ? Upregulation of Wnt agonists and downregulation of Wnt antagonists in the secondary hair germ and/or dermal papilla drives hair growth (anagen) induction in mice. Autocrine Wnt signalling in murine epithelial hair follicle stem cells is required to maintain their stem cell function. Reduction of Wnt ligands or increased expression of Wnt antagonists induces dysregulation of the murine hair follicle cycle and causes alopecia. What does this study add ? This study demonstrates for the first time that key Wnt pathway regulatory agonists, antagonists and target genes, are expressed in the human telogen-to-early-anagen transformation. On human anagen induction the Wnt ligands WNT3, WNT4 and WNT10B are increased in the regenerating epithelium, whereas the Wnt antagonist, SFRP1 (secreted frizzled-related protein 1), is reduced. Human anagen induction has fundamental differences in the expression of Wnt ligands compared with the murine system. What is the translational message ? Regulation of these Wnt ligands permits targeted therapeutic interventions in human hair growth disorders and informs development of new drugs that promote or suppress anagen induction.",

    "text": "\" Why is hair curly ?-Deductions from the structure and the biomechanics of the mature hair shaft. The final shape of a head hair is predetermined through a variety of factors during its formation in the follicle. These are genetic pathways, specific growth factors, cell differentiation and segregation, etc, with spatial as well as chronological dynamics. The cortex of hair consists of two major cell groups. These are characterized by parallel (para-type) or roughly helical arrangements (ortho-type) of the intermediate filaments (IF). There are also cell-specific differences in the disulphide content, that is, of the cross-link density of the IF-associated matrix proteins. Given the current state of the academic discussion, we consider it as timely to support and broaden the view that, the structural differences of the cell types together with their lateral segregation are the main driving factor of curl formation. The mechanical effects, which derive thereof, are triggered in the transition zone of the follicle, that is, upon formation of the mature hair shaft. Furthermore, an irregular, \" \" flat \" \" cross section of the hair shaft is shown to be a synergistic but not determining factor of curl formation. The degree of cell type segregation along the mature hair shaft together with dynamic changes of the location of the plane of segregation, namely in a non-circular cross section can account for very complex curl patterns. Against the background of these views, we argue that contributions to hair curl are implausible, if they relate to physical mechanisms which are active below the transition zone from the living to the mature (dead) hair. \"",

Purpose: We designed formulations based on minoxidil (MXD) nanoparticles (N-MXD) and examined whether N-MXD can increase drug delivery into the follicles. In addition, we investigated the effect of N-MXD on hair growth in C57BL/6 mice. Methods: N-MXD (1%) was prepared as follows: methylcellulose, p-hydroxyalkylbenzoates, mannitol, and MXD were dispersed in purified water and milled using zirconia beads under refrigeration (5500 rpm, 30 sx15 times, intermittent milling). C57BL/6 mice were used to evaluate hair-growth effects. The expression levels of mRNA and protein for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were determined by real-time PCR and ELISA methods, respectively. Results: The ratio of solid-MXD was approximately 60% in N-MXD, and the MXD nanoparticles (90-300 nm) were oblong in shape. For the design of nanomedicines, usability is important. Therefore, we measured the stability and toxicity after N-MXD treatment. No agglutination of MXD nanoparticles was detected for 2 weeks, and no redness or MXD powder residue was observed in the skin after repetitive applications of N-MXD. Next, we evaluated hair-growth effects by N-MXD treatment. MXD contents in the skin tissue from N-MXD were lower than for commercially available MXD formulations (CA-MXD). Conversely, MXD contents in the hair bulbs were higher for N-MXD than for CA-MXD, and the drug efficacy of N-MXD was also higher than that of CA-MXD. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of IGF-1 and VEGF were enhanced by the repetitive application of N-MXD and CA-MXD, and the enhanced IGF-1 and VEGF levels were significantly higher for N-MXD than for CA-MXD. Conclusion: We designed a novel nanomedicine based on MXD nanoparticles and showed that N-MXD can deliver MXD into hair bulbs via hair follicles and that the therapeutic efficiency for hair growth is higher than for CA-MXD (solution type).",

    "text": "Hair growth potential of Salvia plebeia extract and its associated mechanisms. Context: Although Salvia plebeia (SP) R. Brown (Labiatae) is known to possess various biological activities, the effects of SP on hair growth have not been elucidated. Objective: To investigate the hair growth potential of SP extract by using human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and C57BL/6 mice. Materials and methods: The entire SP plant sample was ground into powder and extracted with 99. 9% methyl alcohol. Various concentrations of SP extract were added to hDPCs to evaluate the proliferation, migration, and factors related to hair growth and cycling. Effect of topical SP administration on hair regrowth was tested in vivo in male C57BL/6 mice for 21 days. Results: SP extract significantly increased the proliferation of cultured hDPCs at doses of 15. 6 and 31. 3 mug/mL compared to control group by 123% and 132%, respectively. Expression of hepatocyte growth factor increased while the level of TGF-beta1 and SMAD2/3 decreased when treated with SP extract. At the molecular level, the extract activated Wnt/beta-catenin signalling by raising beta-catenin and phospho-GSK3beta expression. SP extract also exerted anti-apoptotic and proliferative effects in hDPCs by increasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and activating cell proliferation-related proteins, ERK and Akt. Finally, the extract caused an induction of the anagen phase leading to significantly enhanced hair growth in treated male mice. Discussion and conclusion: Our results indicate that SP extract has the capacity to activate hDPCs into a proliferative state to promote hair growth. Further research is necessary to determine the bioactive components and their mechanisms of action responsible for SP-related hair growth effect.",

    "text": "Innovations hair restoration surgeons have made to adapt to the challenges of follicular unit excision. BACKGROUND: Early use of follicular unit excision (FUE) as a method of hair transplantation was limited by high rates of hair follicle transection. This hurdle has been overcome by innovative methods, punch shapes, and devices. With the vast array of tools available, it can be difficult for hair transplant surgeons to choose the best option for their practices. AIMS: To provide an in-depth review and comparison of currently available FUE methods, punch designs, and motorized devices, and discuss how these tools fit the unique skin and hair characteristics of patients. METHODS: A review of the literature and available information on FUE methods, punches, and devices, as well as the authors ' experience in this area, is provided. RESULTS: Innovative FUE methods, punch shapes, and motorized devices have successfully minimized the rate of hair follicle transection. Methods include the use of sharp punches with depth control, and blunt rotating punches. Punch shapes such as flared, hybrid, and edge out have successfully reduced transections by keeping the cutting edge away from the follicles under the skin. The development of motorized devices using features including rotation, roto-oscillation, oscillation, vibration, suction, and hydration has also aided in achieving more successful graft excision. CONCLUSION: Follicular unit excision is a widely used technique by hair restoration surgeons. Therefore, it is important for physicians to be aware of the array of punches and devices available and understand how these tools can be used to adapt to the unique skin and hair characteristics of individual patients to optimize successful graft harvesting.",

The skin is a multilayered organ, equipped with appendages (that is, follicles and glands), that is critical for regulating body temperature and the retention of bodily fluids, guarding against external stresses and mediating the sensation of touch and pain1, 2. Reconstructing appendage-bearing skin in cultures and in bioengineered grafts is a biomedical challenge that has yet to be met3-9. Here we report an organoid culture system that generates complex skin from human pluripotent stem cells. We use stepwise modulation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling pathways to co-induce cranial epithelial cells and neural crest cells within a spherical cell aggregate. During an incubation period of 4-5 months, we observe the emergence of a cyst-like skin organoid composed of stratified epidermis, fat-rich dermis and pigmented hair follicles that are equipped with sebaceous glands. A network of sensory neurons and Schwann cells form nerve-like bundles that target Merkel cells in organoid hair follicles, mimicking the neural circuitry associated with human touch. Single-cell RNA sequencing and direct comparison to fetal specimens suggest that the skin organoids are equivalent to the facial skin of human fetuses in the second trimester of development. Moreover, we show that skin organoids form planar hair-bearing skin when grafted onto nude mice. Together, our results demonstrate that nearly complete skin can self-assemble in vitro and be used to reconstitute skin in vivo. We anticipate that our skin organoids will provide a foundation for future studies of human skin development, disease modelling and reconstructive surgery.",

BACKGROUND: Hair loss is a prevalent medical problem in both men and women. Maintaining the potential hair inductivity of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) during cell culture is the main factor in hair follicle morphogenesis and regeneration. The present study was conducted to compare the effects of different concentrations of human hair outer root sheath cell (HHORSC) and platelet lysis (PL) exosomes to maintain hair inductivity of the human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs). METHODS: In this study, hDPCs and HHORSCs were isolated from healthy hair samples. Specific markers of hDPCs (versican, alpha-SMA) and HHORSCs (K15) were evaluated using flow cytometric and immunocytochemical techniques. The exosomes were isolated from HHORSCs and PL with ultracentrifugation technique. Western blot was used to detect specific markers of HHORSCs and PL exosomes. Particle size and distribution of the exosomes were analyzed by NanoSight dynamic light NanoSight Dynamic Light Scattering. Different methods such as proliferation test (MTS assay), migration test (Transwell assay) were used to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of exosomes (2, 550, 100 microg/ml) derived from HHORSC and PL on hDPCs. Expression of specific genes in the hair follicle inductivity, including ALP, versican and alpha-SMA were also evaluated using real time-PCR. RESULTS: The flow cytometry of the specific cytoplasmic markers of the hDPCs and HHORSCs showed expression of versican (77%), alpha-SMA (55. 2%) and K15 (73. 2%). The result of particle size and distribution of the exosomes were analyzed by NanoSight dynamic light NanoSight Dynamic Light Scattering, which revealed the majority of HHORSC and PL exosomes were 30-150 nm. For 100 microg/ml of HHORSC exosomes, the expressions of ALP, versican and alpha-SMA proteins respectively increased by a factor of 2. 1, 1. 7and 1. 3 compared to those in the control group. CONCLUSION: In summary, we applied HHORSC exosomes as a new method to support hair inductivity of dermal papilla cells and improve the outcome for the treatment of hair loss.",

    "text": "Alopecia areata susceptibility variant in MHC region impacts expressions of genes contributing to hair keratinization and is involved in hair loss. BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) is considered a highly heritable, T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease of the hair follicle. However, no convincing susceptibility gene has yet been pinpointed in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a genome region known to be associated with AA as compared to other regions. METHODS: We engineered mice carrying AA risk allele identified by haplotype sequencing for the MHC region using allele-specific genome editing with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Finally, we performed functional evaluations in the mice and AA patients with and without the risk allele. FINDINGS: We identified a variant (rs142986308, p. Arg587Trp) in the coiled-coil alpha-helical rod protein 1 (CCHCR1) gene as the only non-synonymous variant in the AA risk haplotype. Furthermore, mice engineered to carry the risk allele displayed a hair loss phenotype. Transcriptomics further identified CCHCR1 as a novel component interacting with hair cortex keratin in hair shafts. Both, these alopecic mice and AA patients with the risk allele displayed morphologically impaired hair and comparable differential expression of hair-related genes, including hair keratin and keratin-associated proteins (KRTAPs). INTERPRETATION: Our results implicate CCHCR1 with the risk allele in a previously unidentified subtype of AA based on aberrant keratinization in addition to autoimmune events.

    "text": "\" Quantitative analysis of the anatomical changes in the scalp and hair follicles in androgenetic alopecia using magnetic resonance imaging. BACKGROUND: Although the structural changes of the scalp in androgenetic alopecia (AGA) have been reported, these changes have been poorly understood. It is expected that modern MRI would visualize the scalp anatomy in vivo. This study aimed to explore whether AGA causes (a) changes in the thickness of the scalp, (b) anatomical changes in the hair follicles, and (c) changes in the signal intensity of MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven volunteers underwent MRI for hair and scalp (MRH) and were categorized into two according to the Hamilton-Norwood Scale: the \" \" AGA group \" \" and the \" \" normal group. \" \" Two radiologists analyzed the thickness and signal intensity of the scalp, and the depth of hair follicles. These measurements were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The thickness of the hypodermis and the entire scalp was significantly thinner in the AGA group than in the control group. The AGA group had significantly shallower depth of hair follicles and relative depth of the hair follicles to that of the entire scalp than the normal group. The hypodermis showed higher signal intensity in the AGA group than the normal group. CONCLUSION: MRH allowed noninvasive visualization of the scalp anatomy and demonstrated the thinner nature of the entire scalp and hypodermis, along with the shallower depth of the hair follicles in the AGA group in comparison to the normal group. Additionally, MRH demonstrated the increased MR signal intensity in the scalp associated with AGA. MRH may be a promising new method for quantitative and objective analyses of AGA. \"",

Hair loss is becoming increasingly prevalent as dietary and living habits change. The search for natural products to limit hair loss has led to tapping into traditional cosmetic knowledge. We studied three plants of the Polynesian cosmetopoeia, Bidens pilosa, Calophyllum inophyllum and Fagraea berteroana, to determine their ability to promote hair growth. Their chemical content was characterized by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Their proliferative activity on dermal papilla cells (DPCs) was assessed via MTT assay and molecular targets were evaluated by RT-qPCR analysis of seven factors involved in the modulation of the hair cycle, CCND1, LEF1, DKK1, WNT5A PPARD, TGFBeta1, PPARD and RSPO2. Our results show that our extracts significantly increased proliferation of dermal papilla cells. Furthermore, LC-MS/MS analysis revealed a diversity of molecules, flavonoids, iridoids and organic acids, some known for hair-inducing properties. Finally, specific extracts and fractions of all three plants either upregulated CCND1, LEF1 and PPARD involved in stimulating hair follicle proliferation and/or lowered the gene expression levels of hair growth inhibiting factors, DKK1 and TGFB1. Our findings suggest that extracts from B. pilosa, C. inophyllum and F. berteroana are interesting candidates to stimulate hair growth.",

In this review, we propose that telomere length dynamics play an important but underinvestigated role in the biology of the hair follicle (HF), a prototypic, cyclically remodeled miniorgan that shows an intriguing aging pattern in humans. Whereas the HF pigmentary unit ages quickly, its epithelial stem cell (ESC) component and regenerative capacity are surprisingly aging resistant. Telomerase-deficient mice with short telomeres display an aging phenotype of hair graying and hair loss that is attributed to impaired HF ESC mobilization. Yet, it remains unclear whether the function of telomerase and telomeres in murine HF biology translate to the human system. Therefore, we propose new directions for future telomere research of the human HF. Such research may guide the development of novel treatments for selected disorders of human hair growth or pigmentation (e. g., chemotherapy-induced alopecia, telogen effluvium, androgenetic alopecia, cicatricial alopecia, graying). It might also increase the understanding of the global role of telomeres in aging-related human disease.",

We find that Wnt3a, which maintains the hair-generating activity of DP cells, is enriched and more strongly associated with hFB-EVs than with fibroblasts. Furthermore, hFB-EV-associated Wnt3a mediated receptor activation in cultured DP cells, leading to an increase in beta-catenin in the cytoplasm and its translocation into the nucleus, thereby elevating expression of the target genes Axin2 and Lef1. Additionally, hFB-EVs promoted the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of ORS cells and elongation of the hair shaft in human HFs.

BACKGROUND: Androgenic alopecia (AGA) is the most common type of hair loss, in which dihyrotestosterone (DHT) plays a crucial role via modulating androgen receptors in hair follicles. AIMS: The current objective is to search for new therapy of AGA. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the effects of sulforaphane, its precursor glucosinlates and glucosinlates-enriched Brassica oleracea L. var. italic Planch extract (BOE) on the growth of hair follicle and the related matrix cell viability, as well as the possible underlying mechanisms in vitro and ex vivo. RESULTS: We observed that BOE, glucosinlates, and sulforaphane can prevent the testosterone-induced inhibition of dermal papilla (DP) cells viability. BOE and sulforaphane can even hinder the testosterone-induced inhibition of HaCaT cells viability. Moreover, BOE, glucosinlates, and sulforaphane can up-regulate the cytokeratin gene expression in HaCaT cells, prevent the increase in Bax gene levels induced by testosterone in DP, and promote the growth of hair follicle of mice. These effects can be linked to the enhancement of DP and HaCaT cells activities and the prevention of the testosterone-induced cell apoptosis of DP cells.

In this study, we describe the effects of Lactobacillus paracasei HY7015 (HY7015) on promoting mouse hair growth. Since our purpose was to increase hair growth through oral administration, medicinal yeast, at a suitable concentration for application in mice, was used as a positive control. First, experiments were conducted to determine the effect of HY7015 on proliferation of hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPC), which are important contributors to hair growth. HY7015 stimulated HFDPC proliferation in vitro and increased their secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1. In mouse experiments, oral administration of HY7015 promoted hair growth and hair follicle maturation in the dorsal skin, as well as increasing growth factor levels in mouse serum. In summary, we demonstrate that L. paracasei HY7015 consumption can promote hair growth by stimulating HFDPC proliferation and growth factor secretion. Follow-up studies are warranted to determine the underlying mechanism, using various approaches, including investigation of changes in intestinal microbiota and alteration of gene and protein expression.",

Braun & Asch is a well-studied plant in Chinese medicine that is used for the treatment of several diseases. A recent study has revealed the effects of extract of Cetipeda minima (CMX) standardized by brevilin A in inducing hair growth. However, the mechanism of action of CMX in human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) has not yet been identified. We aimed to investigate the molecular basis underlying the effect of CMX on hair growth in HFDPCs. CMX induced the proliferation of HFDPCs, and the transcript-level expression of Wnt family member 5a (Wnt5a), frizzled receptor (FZDR), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was upregulated. These results correlated with an increase in the expression of growth-related factors, such as VEGF and IGF-1. Immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry further revealed that the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK was enhanced by CMX in HFDPCs, and beta-catenin accumulated significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, CMX substantially induced the expression of Wnt signaling-related proteins, such as GSK phosphorylation and beta-catenin. This study supports the hypothesis that CMX promotes hair growth and secretion of growth factors via the Wnt/beta-catenin, ERK, and JNK signaling pathways. In addition, computational predictions of drug-likeness, together with ADME property predictions, revealed the satisfactory bioavailability score of CMX compounds, exhibiting high gastrointestinal absorption. We suggest that CMX could be used as a promising treatment for hair regeneration and minimization of hair loss.",

    "text": "Amphiregulin promotes hair regeneration of skin-derived precursors via the PI3K and MAPK pathways. OBJECTIVES: There are significant clinical challenges associated with alopecia treatment, including poor efficiency of related drugs and insufficient hair follicles (HFs) for transplantation. Skin-derived precursors (SKPs) exhibit great potential as stem cell-based therapies for hair regeneration ; however, the proliferation and hair-inducing capacity of SKPs gradually decrease during culturing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe a 3D co-culture system accompanied by kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes and gene ontology enrichment analyses to determine the key factors and pathways that enhance SKP stemness and verified using alkaline phosphatase assays, Ki-67 staining, HF reconstitution, Western blot and immunofluorescence staining. The upregulated genes were confirmed utilizing corresponding recombinant protein or small-interfering RNA silencing in vitro, as well as the evaluation of telogen-to-anagen transition and HF reconstitution in vivo. RESULTS: The 3D co-culture system revealed that epidermal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells enhanced SKP proliferation and HF regeneration capacity by amphiregulin (AREG), with the promoted stemness allowing SKPs to gain an earlier telogen-to-anagen transition and high-efficiency HF reconstitution. By contrast, inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways downstream of AREG signalling resulted in diametrically opposite activities. CONCLUSIONS: By exploiting a 3D co-culture model, we determined that AREG promoted SKP stemness by enhancing both proliferation and hair-inducing capacity through the PI3K and MAPK pathways. These findings suggest AREG therapy as a potentially promising approach for treating alopecia.",

    "text": "A folliculocentric perspective of dandruff pathogenesis: Could a troublesome condition be caused by changes to a natural secretory mechanism ? Dandruff is a common scalp condition, which frequently causes psychological distress in those affected. Dandruff is considered to be caused by an interplay of several factors. However, the pathogenesis of dandruff remains under-investigated, especially with respect to the contribution of the hair follicle. As the hair follicle exhibits unique immune-modulatory properties, including the creation of an immunoinhibitory, immune-privileged milieu, we propose a novel hypothesis taking into account the role of the hair follicle. We hypothesize that the changes and imbalance of yeast and bacterial species, along with increasing proinflammatory sebum by-products, leads to the activation of immune response and inflammation. Hair follicle keratinocytes may then detect these changes in scalp microbiota resulting in the recruitment of leukocytes to the inflammation site. These changes in the scalp skin immune-microenvironment may impact hair follicle immune privilege status, which opens new avenues into exploring the role of the hair follicle in dandruff pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Studies on mice and aging human hair follicles provide compelling evidence that graying of hair results from premature differentiation of Melanocyte stem cells (MeSC) in the niche/bulge. OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether differentiation of melanocyte stem cells is responsible for premature graying of hair (PGH). METHODS: Twenty-five patients of PGH (n = 25) attending dermatology department were recruited. Five unpigmented and five pigmented hairs were obtained per patient by separating individual follicles by 1 mm punch biopsies. The hairs were dissected at a distance of 2 mm from the bulb to separate the stem cells (upper segment) (US) from the melanocytes (lower segment) (LS). RNA was extracted from hair follicle segments US and LS, and expression of GP100, Tyrosinase (TYR) and Tyrosinase related protein-1 (TYRP1) genes was quantified using Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit. RESULTS: We found melanogenesis gene expression in both temporary (US) and permanent (LS) segments of unpigmented and pigmented hair follicles. When compared between the US and LS of white hair, the expression of TYR and GP100 was much higher in US than LS, suggestive of melanogenesis in the bulge. Similarly, when compared between white and black US, the expression of all three genes was higher in white US than black US, although not statistically significant. LIMITATIONS: Low samples size and lack of data pertaining to the expression of genes at protein level are the limitations of current study. CONCLUSION: Even though this pilot study data yielded key information about the expression of GP100, TYR and TYRP-1 at mRNA level, further studies quantifying the expression of these genes at protein level are needed to provide additional clues to further address the results in detail.",

    "text": "Effects of a Watercress Extract Fraction on R-spondin 1-Mediated Growth of Human Hair. OBJECTIVE: Hair loss and greying affect men and women of all ages, often causing psychosocial difficulties. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a major hair loss factor secreted from dermal papilla (DP) cells in response to the secretion of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), has been reported to induce and accelerate androgenetic alopecia (AGA). In addition, DKK1 acts as a potent suppressor of melanogenesis and is closely related to hair colour. R-spondin 1 (RSPO1) is a secretory agonist of Wnt signalling known to antagonize the effects of DKK1, including DKK1-mediated hair follicle suppression. In this study, we investigated the effect of watercress extract (WCE) on the secretion of RSPO1 and DKK1 from DP cells as well as its anti-hair loss effect in human hair follicles and patients. METHODS: The in vitro secretion of RSPO1 and DKK1 was measured by ELISA. Human hair follicles were collected from the scalp of a female donor and used for ex vivo organ culture to investigate the effects of WCE on human hair loss. Finally, a 6-month human clinical trial was conducted to examine the effect of WCE-containing lotion on hair growth in a male panel. RESULTS: WCE significantly upregulated RSPO1 secretion and suppressed DKK1 secretion in a dose-dependent manner, even in the presence of DHT. WCE-treated hair follicles elongated 1. 6-fold compared to the control, and the level of RSPO1 production in DP as well as RSPO1 bound to the outer root sheath (ORS) increased. In the clinical trial, the hair lotion containing 2% WCE increased hair thickness and density to improve against hair loss symptoms. CONCLUSION: WCE exhibited a strong anti-androgenic effect through its ability to suppress DKK1 secretion and antagonize DKK1 via RSPO1. These findings highlighted the potential use of WCE for the treatment of hair loss. These results also showed that WCE might have an effect on hair colour since DKK1 is a suppressor of melanogenesis.",

Harvesting primary epithelial keratinocytes from plucked human hair follicles (HFs) represents an easy and non-invasive alternative to a fibroblast culture from invasive skin biopsies. Nevertheless, to facilitate and simplify the process, which can be divided into three main steps (collecting, culturing and reprogramming), the whole procedure of generating hair keratinocytes has to be revised and upgraded continuously.

Nevertheless, the role of DPC derived chemokines and other cytokines in the hair follicle biology remain speculative. In this study, we investigated the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and stem cell factor (SCF) in different passages of cultured DPC and their effects on the biological behaviour of DPC. METHODS: The expression of bFGF, ET-1 and SCF in different passages of cultured DPC and their possible effects on the biological behavior of DPC are investigated using in situ hybridization and immunochemistry. In addition, we performed transplantation of hair follicle cells into nude mice. The cultured DPC, dermal sheath cells and fibroblast of human scalp, respectively, were mixed with cells of the hair follicle epithelium in different ratios, and then were cultured in hair follicle organotypic cultures or implanted into the subcutis of nude mice. RESULTS: The expression of ET-1 and SCF in early passages of cultured DPC became stronger, but turned weaker and even negative in late passages (> 6 passages). Hair follicle-like structures were formed after DPC combined with the cells of hair follicle epithelium cells in hair follicle organotypic cultures. When hair follicle organotypic cultures were implanted into the subcutis of nude mice, the relative intact hair follicles were formed. After the transplantation of hair follicle cells into the nude mice, the hair follicle-like structure was formed in the group that contained DPC mixed with hair follicle epithelium cells. However, no hair follicles were formed in the other two groups. It was found that the higher the expression of ET-1 and SCF in DPC, the stronger the ability of DPC to induce hair follicle regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: The cultured DPC can induce hair follicle regeneration and sustain hair growth in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the expression of ET-1 and SCF is correlated with the ability of DPC inducing hair follicle regeneration.",

Mutation in the serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 3 (Sgk3, also known as Sgkl or Cisk) gene causes both defective hair follicle development and altered hair cycle in mice. We examined Sgk3-mutant YPC mice (YPC-Sgk3 (ypc)/Sgk3 (ypc)) and found expression of SGK3 protein with altered function. In the hair follicles of YPC mice, the aberrant differentiation and poor proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes during the period of postnatal hair follicle development resulted in a complete lack of hair medulla and weak hair. Surprisingly, the length of postnatal hair follicle development and anagen term was shown to be dramatically shortened. Also, phosphorylation of GSK3beta at Ser9 and the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin were reduced in the developing YPC hair follicle, suggesting that phosphorylation of GSK3beta and WNT-beta-catenin pathway takes part in the SGK3-dependent regulation of hair follicle development. Moreover, the above-mentioned features, especially the hair-cycling pattern, differ from those in other Sgk3-null mutant strains, suggesting that the various patterns of dysfunction in the SGK3 protein may result in phenotypic variation. Our results indicate that SGK3 is a very important and characteristic molecule that plays a critical role in both hair follicle morphogenesis and hair cycling.",

Although it has been hypothesized that the autoimmunity is mediated by T cells and that hair follicle melanocyte is one of the targets, definitive evidence is lacking. We here demonstrate that AA-like lesions can be induced in mice by inducing CD8 (+) T-cell-mediated immunity to hair follicle melanocytes. We found that hair loss was induced in mice-bearing interleukin-12-producing B16 melanoma cells by the depletion of CD4 (+) T cells, accompanied by vitiligo-like coat color change. The alopecic lesions varied in size from pachy to extensive. In many instances, hair loss developed and was followed by the regrowth of white hairs. Histological analysis revealed that mononuclear cells infiltrated in and around the bulb region of hair follicles. Furthermore, immunohistochemical examination clearly showed the intra-follicular infiltration of CD8 (+) T cells. Neither the vitiligo-like coat color nor AA-like lesions were induced when CD8 (+) T cells were codepleted. These observations indicate that the induction of CD8 (+) T-cell-mediated immunity against hair follicle melanocytes causes alopecia. It is thought that there are many types of AA with different mechanisms, targets etc. Although hair follicle melanocytes have long been thought to be one of the targets of AA, evidence to support the hypothesis is sparse. Therefore, we believe that our observation is significant to support the hypothesis.",

    "text": "The hair follicle as an estrogen target and source. For many decades, androgens have dominated endocrine research in hair growth control. Androgen metabolism and the androgen receptor currently are the key targets for systemic, pharmacological hair growth control in clinical medicine. However, it has long been known that estrogens also profoundly alter hair follicle growth and cycling by binding to locally expressed high-affinity estrogen receptors (ERs). Besides altering the transcription of genes with estrogen-responsive elements, 17beta-estradiol (E2) also modifies androgen metabolism within distinct subunits of the pilosebaceous unit (i. e., hair follicle and sebaceous gland). The latter displays prominent aromatase activity, the key enzyme for androgen conversion to E2, and is both an estrogen source and target. Here, we chart the recent renaissance of estrogen research in hair research ; explain why the hair follicle offers an ideal, clinically relevant test system for studying the role of sex steroids, their receptors, and interactions in neuroectodermal-mesodermal interaction systems in general ; and illustrate how it can be exploited to identify novel functions and signaling cross talks of ER-mediated signaling. Emphasizing the long-underestimated complexity and species-, gender-, and site-dependence of E2-induced biological effects on the hair follicle, we explore targets for pharmacological intervention in clinically relevant hair cycle manipulation, ranging from androgenetic alopecia and hirsutism via telogen effluvium to chemotherapy-induced alopecia. While defining major open questions, unsolved clinical challenges, and particularly promising research avenues in this area, we argue that the time has come to pay estrogen-mediated signaling the full attention it deserves in future endocrinological therapy of common hair growth disorders.",

K14Cre (+)/Miz1 (lox/lox) mice have rough fur as a result of altered hair follicle orientation, irregular hair pigmentation and disturbed hair fiber structure. A regional thickening of the epidermis at the hair funnel orifice was accompanied by suprabasal proliferation, indicating a delayed exit of keratinocytes from the cell cycle. In addition, the catagen of the hair cycle was delayed in K14Cre (+)/Miz1 (lox/lox) mice and intrafollicular keratinocyte proliferation was increased. In aged K14Cre (+)/Miz1 (lox/lox) animals, the number of hair follicles remained unchanged but the number of visible hairs, especially of zigzag hairs, was reduced and a pigmentary incontinence into the dermis developed.

Furthermore, the side effect of long period medication could not be avoided. Hair transplantation involves harvesting small pieces of hair-bearing scalp grafts from a donor site and relocating them to a bald area. This method does not increase the number of existing hairs, but only redistributes them. The operation is sophisticated and time-consuming, thus the patient suffers a lot during the process. The discovery of hair follicle stem cells (FSC) brings gospel to the affected individual of hair loss because of its capacity of generating new hair when they interact with mesenchymal dermal papilla cells (DPC). Besides, both FSC and DPC have strong proliferative capacity and the patient ' s own cells could be expanded considerably in vitro. Thus we hypothesize that the microencapsulation of the two kinds of cells in alginate gels could be implanted into the bald scalp of the patient since alginate gels is effective in cell transplantation.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction using mRNA derived from microdissected, anagen-stage human hair follicles and comparison to non-follicular skin epithelium revealed higher levels of IL-6 (15. 5-fold) and oncostatin M (OSM, 3. 4-fold) in hair follicles. In contrast, expression of all mRNAs coding for IL-6 cytokine family receptors was reduced. Immunohistology suggested expression of OSM, gp130, leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFr) and IL-11r in the hair follicle root sheaths and dermal papilla, while IL-11, IL-6r and OSMr were expressed in root sheaths alone. IL-6 was expressed in the dermal papilla while cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) and LIF were not observed.

OSM and CT-1 incubated with agarose beads and injected subcutaneously at 1 mug per mouse into telogen skin of 65-day-old mice revealed no capacity to induce anagen hair growth. In contrast, injection of 65-day-old mice in which anagen had been induced by hair plucking revealed a moderate hair growth inhibitory capacity for OSM, but no significant effect for CT-1.

Melatonin, the chief secretory product of the pineal gland, has long been known to modulate hair growth, pigmentation and/or molting in many species, presumably as a key neuroendocrine regulator that couples coat phenotype and function to photoperiod-dependent environmental and reproductive changes. However, the detailed effects and mechanisms of this surprisingly pleiotropic indole on the hair follicle (HF) regarding growth control and pigmentation have not yet been completely understood. While unspecific melatonin binding sites have long been identified (e. g., in goat and mouse HFs), specific melatonin membrane MT2 receptor transcripts and both protein and mRNA expression for a specific nuclear melatonin binding site [retinoid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORalpha)] have only recently been identified in murine HFs. MT1, known to be expressed in human skin cells, is not transcribed in mouse skin. After initial enzymologic data from hamster skin related to potential intracutaneous melatonin synthesis, it has recently been demonstrated that murine and human skin, namely human scalp HFs in anagen, are important sites of extrapineal melatonin synthesis. Moreover, HF melatonin production is enhanced by catecholamines (as it classically occurs in the pineal gland). Melatonin may also functionally play a role in hair-cycle control, as it down-regulates both apoptosis and estrogen receptor-alpha expression, and modulates MT2 and RORalpha expression in murine skin in a hair-cycle-dependent manner. Because of melatonin ' s additional potency as a free radical scavenger and DNA repair inducer, the metabolically and proliferatively highly active anagen hair bulb may also exploit melatonin synthesis in loco as a self-cytoprotective strategy.",

CONTEXT: Both insufficient and excess levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) can result in altered hair/skin structure and function (e. g. effluvium). However, it is still unclear whether T3 and T4 exert any direct effects on human hair follicles (HFs), and if so, how exactly human HFs respond to T3/T4 stimulation. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to asses the impact of T3/T4 on human HF in vitro. METHODS: Human anagen HFs were isolated from skin obtained from females undergoing facelift surgery. HFs from euthyroid females between 40 and 69 yr (average, 56 yr) were cultured and treated with T3/T4. RESULTS: Studying microdissected, organ-cultured normal human scalp HFs, we show here that T4 up-regulates the proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes, whereas their apoptosis is down-regulated by T3 and T4. T4 also prolongs the duration of the hair growth phase (anagen) in vitro, possibly due to the down-regulation of TGF-beta2, the key anagen-inhibitory growth factor. Because we show here that human HFs transcribe deiodinase genes (D2 and D3), they may be capable of converting T4 to T3. Intrafollicular immunoreactivity for the recognized thyroid hormone-responsive keratins cytokeratin (CK) 6 and CK14 is significantly modulated by T3 and T4 (CK6 is enhanced, CK14 down-regulated). Both T3 and T4 also significantly stimulate intrafollicular melanin synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we present the first evidence that human HFs are direct targets of thyroid hormones and demonstrate that T3 and/or T4 modulate multiple hair biology parameters, ranging from HF cycling to pigmentation.",

To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of embryonic HF fate determination during epidermal development/differentiation, we analyzed conditional mutant mice with keratinocytes expressing constitutively active beta-catenin (K5-Cre Catnb (ex3) fl/+). The mutant mice developed scaly skin with a thickened epidermis and showed impaired epidermal stratification. The hair shaft keratins were broadly expressed in the epidermis but there was no expression of the terminal differentiation markers K1 and loricrin. Hair placode markers (Bmp2 and Shh) and follicular dermal condensate markers (noggin, patched 1 and Pdgfra) were expressed throughout the epidermis and the upper dermis, respectively. These results indicate that the embryonic epidermal keratinocytes have switched extensively to the HF fate. A series of genetic studies demonstrated that the epidermal switching to HF fate was suppressed by introducing the conditional mutation K5-Cre Catnb (ex3) fl/+ Shhfl/-(with additional mutation of Shh signaling) or K5-Cre Catnb (ex3) fl/+ BmprIAfl/fl (with additional mutation of Bmp signaling). These results demonstrate that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling relayed through Shh and Bmp signals is the principal regulatory mechanism underlying the HF cell fate change. Assessment of Bmp2 promoter activities suggested a putative regulation by beta-catenin signaling relayed by Shh signaling towards Bmp2. We also found that Shh protein expression was increased and expanded in the epidermis of K5-Cre Catnb (ex3) fl/+ BmprIAfl/fl mice.

BACKGROUND: Hair follicle (HF) ostia represent a potential port of microbial entry into the skin. However, they rarely show clinical signs of infection. This suggests the presence of local, efficient, antimicrobial defence systems, which may include antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). OBJECTIVES: We determined the presence and distribution of the major AMPs, RNase 7 and psoriasin (S100A7), in human scalp HFs. We investigated whether HF production of these AMPs was induced by prototypic microbial products and proinflammatory cytokines, i. e. interferon (IFN)-gamma. Finally, we examined whether the classical pathways for AMP induction, such as toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and TLR5 expression, are present in human HFs and up-regulated after stimulation with bacterium-associated ligands. METHODS: Cryosections from fresh or organ-cultured full-thickness normal human scalp skin treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagellin, protein A, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or IFN-gamma were stained for psoriasin and RNase 7 immunoreactivity (IR) as well as for TLR4 and TLR5. In addition, outer root sheath cell culture and semiquantitative analysis of mRNA expression levels of RNase 7 and psoriasin were performed. RESULTS: Specific RNase 7 IR was present throughout the entire HF outer root sheath in situ and in cell culture, whereas psoriasin IR was present only in the most distal compartment and not detectable in cultured ORS cells. Upon treatment with Gram-positive (LTA, protein A) or Gram-negative bacterial (LPS, flagellin) cell wall components, or with the cytokine IFN-gamma, the IR of both psoriasin and RNase 7 was modified. TLR4 and TLR5 IR was detected in the normal HF epithelium and were upregulated after treatment with their respective ligand. The mRNA analysis confirmed the immunohistochemistry results. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that normal human scalp HF epithelium possesses a functional antimicrobial defence system, which includes the AMPs RNase 7 and psoriasin, and TLRs, and that these are induced by classical microbial products.",

The optimal source of stem cells for regenerative medicine is a major question. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have shown promise for pluripotency but have ethical issues and potential to form teratomas. Pluripotent stem cells have been produced from skin cells by either viral-, plasmid-or transposon-mediated gene transfer. These stem cells have been termed induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells. iPS cells may also have malignant potential and are inefficiently produced. Embryonic stem cells may not be suited for individualized therapy, since they can undergo immunologic rejection. To address these fundamental problems, our group is developing hair follicle pluripotent stem (hfPS) cells. Our previous studies have shown that mouse hfPS cells can differentiate to neurons, glial cells in vitro, and other cell types, and can promote nerve and spinal cord regeneration in vivo. hfPS cells are located above the hair follicle bulge in what we have termed the hfPS cell area (hfPSA) and are nestin positive and keratin 15 (K-15) negative. Human hfPS cells can also differentiate into neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, and melanocytes in vitro. In the present study, human hfPS cells were transplanted in the severed sciatic nerve of the mouse where they differentiated into glial fibrillary-acidic-protein (GFAP)-positive Schwann cells and promoted the recovery of pre-existing axons, leading to nerve generation. The regenerated nerve recovered function and, upon electrical stimulation, contracted the gastrocnemius muscle. The hfPS cells can be readily isolated from the human scalp, thereby providing an accessible, autologous and safe source of stem cells for regenerative medicine that have important advantages over ES or iPS cells.",

The Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 are critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and are essential for skin and hair function. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family proteins act downstream of these GTPases, controlling actin assembly and cytoskeletal reorganization, but their role in epithelial cells has not been characterized in vivo. Here, we used a conditional knockout approach to assess the role of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), the ubiquitously expressed Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-like (WASL) protein, in mouse skin. We found that N-WASP deficiency in mouse skin led to severe alopecia, epidermal hyperproliferation, and ulceration, without obvious effects on epidermal differentiation and wound healing. Further analysis revealed that the observed alopecia was likely the result of a progressive and ultimately nearly complete block in hair follicle (HF) cycling by 5 months of age. N-WASP deficiency also led to abnormal proliferation of skin progenitor cells, resulting in their depletion over time. Furthermore, N-WASP deficiency in vitro and in vivo correlated with decreased GSK-3beta phosphorylation, decreased nuclear localization of beta-catenin in follicular keratinocytes, and decreased Wnt-dependent transcription. Our results indicate a critical role for N-WASP in skin function and HF cycling and identify a link between N-WASP and Wnt signaling. We therefore propose that N-WASP acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin-dependent transcription, modulating differentiation of HF progenitor cells.",

The present study examines nestin expression in malignant melanoma and investigates the relationship between nestin expression and prognosis in patients. We immunohistochemically stained 78 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded malignant melanomas for nestin, HMB-45 and S100 reactivity.

The 5-year survival rate of stage I and II nestin-positive cases was significantly decreased compared to the nestin-negative cases (p < 0. 05). In addition, the 5-year survival rate exceeded 80% in nestin-negative malignant melanomas at all stages of tumor development.

They impart much information, not least about our racial, ethnic, health, gender and age status. In the case of the latter parameter, we experience significant change in pigmentation in our journey from birth to puberty and through to young adulthood, middle age and beyond. The hair follicle pigmentary unit is perhaps one of our most visible, accessible and potent aging sensors, with marked dilution of pigment intensity occurring long before even subtle changes are seen in the epidermis. This dichotomy is of interest as both skin compartments contain melanocyte subpopulations of similar embryologic (i. e., neural crest) origin. Research groups are actively pursuing the study of the differential aging of melanocytes in the hair bulb versus the epidermis and in particular are examining whether this is in part linked to the stringent coupling of follicular melanocytes to the hair growth cycle. Whether some follicular melanocyte subpopulations are affected, like epidermal melanocytes, by UV irradiation is not yet clear. A particular target of research into hair graying or canities is the nature of the melanocyte stem compartment and whether this is depleted due to reactive oxygen species-associated damage, coupled with an impaired antioxidant status, and a failure of melanocyte stem cell renewal. Over the last few years, we and others have developed advanced in vitro models and assay systems for isolated hair follicle melanocytes and for intact anagen hair follicle organ culture which may provide research tools to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of hair follicle pigmentation. Long term, it may be feasible to develop strategies to modulate some of these aging-associated changes in the hair follicle that impinge particularly on the melanocyte populations.",

BACKGROUND: Current noncultured cell-based transplantation therapies for vitiligo largely involve shave skin biopsy for preparation of noncultured melanocyte suspension. As the overall proportion of melanocytes is low in the epidermis, these techniques require basal cell layer enrichment, which adds additional steps. We tried follicular unit extraction (FUE) to harvest hair follicles as a source of melanocytes. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of a novel surgical method for vitiligo: noncultured extracted hair follicular outer root sheath (ORS) cell suspension transplantation. METHODS: Fourteen patients with vitiligo, stable for at least 3 months, were included in this prospective study. Fifteen to 25 hair follicles were extracted from occipital scalp using the FUE method. Hair follicles were incubated with trypsin-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid solution at 37 C for 90 min to separate ORS cells. The cell suspension was filtered through a 70-mum cell strainer, then centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 r. p. m. to obtain a cell pellet. The pellet was resuspended and applied to the dermabraded recipient area and dressed. RESULTS: The mean +-SD repigmentation was 65 7 +-36 7%. Overall, nine of 14 patients achieved > 75% repigmentation. Mean percentage repigmentation was significantly higher in patients with > = 1 year stability than those with < 1 year stability (P = 0 02). CONCLUSIONS: Extracted hair follicular ORS cell suspension can be a useful simplified transplantation method for vitiligo. The transplantation procedure should be reserved for patients with vitiligo stable for at least 1 year. A larger study is needed for further evaluation.",

Polycomb protein group (PcG)-dependent trimethylation on H3K27 (H3K27me3) regulates identity of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). How H3K27me3 governs adult SCs and tissue development is unclear. Here, we conditionally target H3K27 methyltransferases Ezh2 and Ezh1 to address their roles in mouse skin homeostasis. Postnatal phenotypes appear only in doubly targeted skin, where H3K27me3 is abolished, revealing functional redundancy in EZH1/2 proteins. Surprisingly, while Ezh1/2-null hair follicles (HFs) arrest morphogenesis and degenerate due to defective proliferation and increased apoptosis, epidermis hyperproliferates and survives engraftment. mRNA microarray studies reveal that, despite these striking phenotypic differences, similar genes are up-regulated in HF and epidermal Ezh1/2-null progenitors. Featured prominently are (1) PcG-controlled nonskin lineage genes, whose expression is still significantly lower than in native tissues, and (2) the PcG-regulated Ink4a/Inkb/Arf locus. Interestingly, when EZH1/2 are absent, even though Ink4a/Arf/Ink4b genes are fully activated in HF cells, they are only partially so in epidermal progenitors. Importantly, transduction of Ink4b/Ink4a/Arf shRNAs restores proliferation/survival of Ezh1/2-null HF progenitors in vitro, pointing toward the relevance of this locus to the observed HF phenotypes. Our findings reveal new insights into Polycomb-dependent tissue control, and provide a new twist to how different progenitors within one tissue respond to loss of H3K27me3.",

Reprogramming patient-specific somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells has great potential to develop feasible regenerative therapies. However, several issues need to be resolved such as ease, efficiency, and safety of generation of iPS cells. Many different cell types have been reprogrammed, most conveniently even peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, they typically require the enforced expression of several transcription factors, posing mutagenesis risks as exogenous genetic material. To reduce this risk, iPS cells were previously generated with Oct4 alone from rather inaccessible neural stem cells that endogenously express the remaining reprogramming factors and very recently from fibroblasts with Oct4 alone in combination with additional small molecules. Here, we exploit that dermal papilla (DP) cells from hair follicles in the skin express all but one reprogramming factors to show that these accessible cells can be reprogrammed into iPS cells with the single transcription factor Oct4 and without further manipulation. Reprogramming was already achieved after 3 weeks and with efficiencies similar to other cell types reprogrammed with four factors. Dermal papilla-derived iPS cells are comparable to embryonic stem cells with respect to morphology, gene expression, and pluripotency.

Point mutations in HR lead to congenital human hair loss, which results in the complete loss of body and scalp hairs. HR functions are indispensable for initiation of postnatal hair follicular cycling. This study investigates the phylogenetic history and analyzes the protein evolutionary rate to provide useful insight into the molecular evolution of HR. The data demonstrates an acceleration of HR sequence evolution in human branch and suggests that the ability of HR protein to mediate postnatal hair-cycling has been altered in the course of human evolution. In particular those residues were pinpointed which should be regarded as target of positive Darwinian selection during human evolution.",

    "text": "Delayed cutaneous wound healing and aberrant expression of hair follicle stem cell markers in mice selectively lacking Ctip2 in epidermis. BACKGROUND: COUP-TF interacting protein 2 [(Ctip2), also known as Bcl11b] is an important regulator of skin homeostasis, and is overexpressed in head and neck cancer. Ctip2 (ep-/-) mice, selectively ablated for Ctip2 in epidermal keratinocytes, exhibited impaired terminal differentiation and delayed epidermal permeability barrier (EPB) establishment during development, similar to what was observed in Ctip2 null (Ctip2 (-/-)) mice. Considering that as an important role of Ctip2, and the fact that molecular networks which underlie cancer progression partially overlap with those responsible for tissue remodeling, we sought to determine the role of Ctip2 during cutaneous wound healing. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Full thickness excisional wound healing experiments were performed on Ctip2 (L2/L2) and Ctip2 (ep-/-) animals per time point and used for harvesting samples for histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunoblotting. Results demonstrated inherent defects in proliferation and migration of Ctip2 lacking keratinocytes during re-epithelialization. Mutant mice exhibited reduced epidermal proliferation, delayed keratinocyte activation, altered cell-cell adhesion and impaired ECM development. Post wounding, Ctip2 (ep-/-) mice wounds displayed lack of E-Cadherin suppression in the migratory tongue, insufficient expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) in the dermis, and robust induction of K8. Importantly, dysregulated expression of several hair follicle (HF) stem cell markers such as K15, NFATc1, CD133, CD34 and Lrig1 was observed in mutant skin during wound repair. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results confirm a cell autonomous role of keratinocytic Ctip2 to modulate cell migration, proliferation and/or differentiation, and to maintain HF stem cells during cutaneous wounding. Furthermore, Ctip2 in a non-cell autonomous manner regulated granulation tissue formation and tissue contraction during wound closure.",

PURPOSE: Diphencyprone (DPCP) is a therapeutic agent for treating alopecia areata. To improve skin absorption and follicular targeting nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were developed. METHODS: Nanoparticles were characterized by size, zeta potential, molecular environment, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In vitro and in vivo skin absorption experiments were performed. Fluorescence and confocal microscopes for imaging skin distribution were used. RESULTS: NLCs with different designs were 208 ~ 265 nm with > 77% DPCP encapsulation. NLCs incorporating a cationic surfactant or more soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) showed higher lipophilicity compared to typical NLCs by Nile red emission. All NLCs tested revealed controlled DPCP release ; burst release was observed for control. The formulation with more SPC provided 275 mug/g DPCP skin retention, which was greater than control and other NLCs. Intersubject deviation was reduced after DPCP loading into NLCs. Cyanoacrylate skin biopsy demonstrated greater follicular deposition for NLCs with more SPC compared to control. Cationic NLCs but not typical or SPC-containing carriers were largely internalized into keratinocytes. In vivo skin retention of NLCs with more SPC was higher than free control. Confocal imaging confirmed localization of NLCs in follicles and intercellular lipids of stratum corneum. CONCLUSIONS: This work encourages further investigation of DPCP absorption using NLCs with a specific formulation design.",

The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures correct chromosome segregation during mitosis by preventing aneuploidy, an event that is detrimental to the fitness and survival of normal cells but oncogenic in tumor cells. Deletion of SAC genes is incompatible with early mouse development, and RNAi-mediated depletion of SAC components in cultured cells results in rapid death. Here we describe the use of a conditional KO of mouse Mad2, an essential component of the SAC signaling cascade, as a means to selectively induce chromosome instability and aneuploidy in the epidermis of the skin. We observe that SAC inactivation is tolerated by interfollicular epidermal cells but results in depletion of hair follicle bulge stem cells. Eventually, a histologically normal epidermis develops within ~ 1 mo after birth, albeit without any hair. Mad2-deficient cells in this epidermis exhibited abnormal transcription of metabolic genes, consistent with aneuploid cell state. Hair follicle bulge stem cells were completely absent, despite the continued presence of rudimentary hair follicles. These data demonstrate that different cell lineages within a single tissue respond differently to chromosome instability: some proliferating cell lineages can survive, but stem cells are highly sensitive.",

The formation of epithelial tubes underlies the development of diverse organs. In the skin, hair follicles resemble tube-like structures with lumens that are generated through poorly understood cellular rearrangements. Here, we show that creation of the hair follicle lumen is mediated by early outward movement of keratinocytes from within the cores of developing hair buds. These migratory keratinocytes express keratin 79 (K79) and stream out of the hair germ and into the epidermis prior to lumen formation in the embryo. Remarkably, this process is recapitulated during hair regeneration in the adult mouse, when K79 (+) cells migrate out of the reactivated secondary hair germ prior to formation of a new hair canal. During homeostasis, K79 (+) cells line the hair follicle infundibulum, a domain we show to be multilayered, biochemically distinct and maintained by Lrig1 (+) stem cell-derived progeny. Upward movement of these cells sustains the infundibulum, while perturbation of this domain during acne progression is often accompanied by loss of K79. Our findings uncover previously unappreciated long-distance cell movements throughout the life cycle of the hair follicle, and suggest a novel mechanism by which the follicle generates its hollow core through outward cell migration.",

Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) normally give rise to keratinocytes, sebocytes, and transient amplifying progenitor cells. Along with the capacity to proliferate rapidly, HFSCs provide the basis for establishing a putative source of stem cells for cell therapy. HFSCs are multipotent stem cells originating from the bulge area. The importance of these cells arises from two important characteristics, distinguishing them from all other adult stem cells. First, they are accessible and proliferate for long periods. Second, they are multipotent, possessing the ability to differentiate into mesodermal and ectodermal cell types. In addition to a developmental capacity in vitro, HFSCs display an ability to form differentiated cells in vivo. During the last two decades, numerous studies have led to the development of an appropriate culture condition for producing various cell lineages from HFSCs. Therefore, these stem cells are considered as a novel source for cell therapy of a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders. This review presents the current status of human, rat, and mouse HFSCs from both the cellular and molecular biology and cell therapy perspectives. The first section of this review highlights the importance of HFSCs and in vitro differentiation, while the final section emphasizes the significance of cell differentiation in vivo.",

Amelogenin, an enamel matrix protein has been considered to be exclusively expressed by ameloblasts during odontogenesis. However, burgeoning evidence indicates that amelogenin is also expressed in non-mineralizing tissues. Under the hypothesis that amelogenin may be a functional molecule in developing hair follicles which share developmental features with odontogenesis, this study for the first time elucidated the presence and functional changes of amelogenin and its receptors during rat hair follicle development. Amelogenin was specifically localized in the outer epithelial root sheath of hair follicles. Its expression appeared in the deeper portion of hair follicles, i. e. the bulbar and suprabulbar regions rather than the superficial region. Lamp-1, an amelogenin receptor, was localized in either follicular cells or outer epithelial sheath cells, reflecting functional changes during development. The expression of amelogenin splicing variants increased in a time-dependent manner during postnatal development of hair follicles. Amelogenin expression was increased by treatment with cyclosporin A, which is an inducer of anagen in the hair follicle, whereas the level of Lamp-1 and-2 was decreased by cyclosporin A treatment.

Bioengineering hair follicles using cells isolated from human tissue remains a difficult task. Dermal papilla (DP) cells are known to guide the growth and cycling activities of hair follicles by interacting with keratinocytes. However, DP cells quickly lose their inductivity during in vitro passaging. Rodent DP cell cultures need external addition of growth factors, including WNT and BMP molecules, to maintain the hair inductive property. CD133 is expressed by a subpopulation of DP cells that are capable of inducing hair follicle formation in vivo. We report here that expression of a stabilized form of beta-catenin promoted clonal growth of CD133-positive (CD133 +) DP cells in in vitro three-dimensional hydrogel culture while maintaining expression of DP markers, including alkaline phosphatase (AP), CD133, and integrin alpha8. After a 2-week in vitro culture, cultured CD133 + DP cells with up-regulated beta-catenin activity led to an accelerated in vivo hair growth in reconstituted skin compared to control cells.

Emerging evidence indicates that even subtle changes in the expression of key genes of signalling pathways can have profound effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are masters of subtlety and generally have only mild effects on their target genes. The microRNA miR-31 is one of the major microRNAs in many cutaneous conditions associated with activated keratinocytes, such as the hyperproliferative diseases psoriasis, non-melanoma skin cancer and hair follicle growth. miR-31 is a marker of the hair growth phase, and in our miR-31 transgenic mouse model it impairs the function of keratinocytes. This leads to aberrant proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation that results in altered hair growth, while the loss of miR-31 leads to increased hair growth. Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we have defined a set of conserved miR-31 target genes, including LATS2 and STK40, which serve as new players in the regulation of keratinocyte growth and hair follicle biology. LATS2 can regulate growth of keratinocytes and we have identified a function of STK40 that can promote the expression of key hair follicle programme regulators such as HR, DLX3 and HOXC13.",

    "text": "Development of Hair Fibres. The growth of hairs occurs during the anagen phase of the follicle cycle. Hair growth begins with basement membrane-bound stem cells (mother cells) around the dermal papilla neck which continuously bud off daughter cells which further divide as a transient amplifying population. Division ceases as cell line differentiation begins, which entails changes in cell junctions, cell shape and position, and cell-line specific cytoplasmic expression of keratin and trichohyalin. As the differentiating cells migrate up the bulb, nuclear function ceases in cortex, cuticle and inner root sheath (IRS) layers. Past the top of the bulb, cell shape/position changes cease, and there is a period of keratin and keratin-associated protein (KAP) synthesis in fibre cell lines, with increases, in particular of KAP species. A gradual keratinization process begins in the cortex at this point and then non-keratin cell components are increasingly broken down. Terminal cornification, or hardening, is associated with water loss and precipitation of keratin. In the upper follicle, the hair, now in its mature form, detaches from the IRS, which is then extracted of material and becomes fragmented to release the fibre. Finally, the sebaceous and sudoriferous (if present) glands coat the fibre in lipid-rich material and the fibre emerges from the skin. This chapter follows the origin of the hair growth in the lower bulb and traces the development of the various cell lines.",

Hair growth is regulated by the interaction between dermal papilla cells (DPC) and other cells inside the hair follicle. Here, we show the effect and action mechanism of mackerel-derived fermented fish oil (FFO) extract and its component docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the control of hair growth. The hair growth effect of FFO extract was evaluated by the culture method of vibrissa follicles and in vivo dotmatrix planimetry method. FFO extract increased the length of hair-fibers and enabled stimulated initiation into the anagen phase of the hair cycle. As expected, FFO extract significantly increased DPC proliferation. FFO extract induced the progression of the cell cycle and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and Akt. FFO extract induced nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, a stimulator of anagen phase, through an increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase3beta (GSK3beta) level. Since various prostaglandins are known to promote hair growth in humans and mice, we examined the effect of DHA, a main omega-3 fatty acid of FFO, on DPC proliferation. DHA not only increased DPC proliferation but also upregulated levels of cell cycle-associated proteins such as cyclin D1 and cdc2 p34. These results show that FFO extract and DHA promote hair growth through the anagen-activating pathways in DPC.",

BACKGROUND: Diffuse alopecia areata (DAA) often leads to a complete hair shedding within a few months. OBJECTIVE: To explore features and mechanisms underlying DAA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scalp and hair root dermoscopy were conducted on 23 DAA patients throughout the disease process, 20 patchy Alopecia areata patients, 23 acute telogen effluvium (ATE) patients and 10 normal controls. Histopathology was also evaluated. RESULTS: We found almost all hair roots were anagen in early stage DAA in 18 patients (18/23, 78. 3%) within the first 4-8 weeks after hair loss onset. Anagen effluvium (~ 4 weeks) was followed by catagen (~ 4 weeks) and then telogen/exogen (~ 8 weeks) effluvium with overlap. Hair root and proximal hair shaft depigmentation was more prominent in later DAA disease stages. Black dots, exclamation mark hairs and inconsistent thickness of hair shafts were found more often in early than later DAA (Ps < 0. 01). Early DAA histopathology revealed more prominent inflammation and hair follicle regression than that observed in the later stages. Patchy alopecia areata patients showed mixed anagen, catagen and telogen hair roots while ATE patients showed increased exogen and mildly decreased hair root pigmentation. CONCLUSION: Sequential cyclic staging of shed hairs in DAA indicates the insult may be hair-cycle specific. We suggest that DAA is initially an anagen effluvium disease involving an intense inflammatory insult, later progressing to a brief catagen effluvium, and then to telogen effluvium with premature exogen, in later stages of DAA.",

Plantar skin retains all of the mechanistic components needed for hair follicle development, as genetic deletion of Dkk2 permits formation of fully functional plantar hair follicles that give rise to external hair, contain sebaceous glands and a stem cell compartment, and undergo regenerative growth. In the absence of Dkk2, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity is initially broadly elevated in embryonic plantar skin and gradually becomes patterned, mimicking follicular development in normally haired areas.

Primary HFSCs were isolated from human scalp skin tissue, cultured, and identified using flow cytometry. An miR-214 mimic and inhibitor were constructed for transfection into HFSCs. The MTS and colony formation assays examined cell proliferation. Immunofluorescence detected the localization and expression levels of TCF4, beta-catenin, and differentiation markers. Luciferase reporter and TOP/FOP Flash assays investigated whether miR-214 targeted EZH2 and regulated the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Western blot determined the expression levels of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), Wnt/beta-catenin signaling-related proteins, and HFSC differentiation markers in cells subjected to miR-214 transfection. miR-214 expression was remarkably decreased during the proliferation and differentiation of HFSCs into transit-amplifying (TA) cells. Downregulation of miR-214 promotes the proliferation and differentiation of HFSCs. Overexpression of miR-214 led to decreased expression of EZH2, beta-catenin, and TCF-4, whereas downregulation of miR-214 resulted in increased expression of EZH2, beta-catenin, and TCF-4 as well as TA differentiation markers.

Several factors, including Platelet-Derived Growth Factor A (PDGFA), Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP2) and Lim-Homeobox gene 2 (LHX2) are implicated in HF morphogenesis and cycle. In this work, the mentioned molecules were investigated to evaluate their role in follicular cycle activation. The study was performed on skin samples collected at different periods of HF cycle and the molecular expression of PDGFA, BMP2 and LHX2 was evaluated by Real-Time PCR (qPCR) at each time point. Since PDGFA showed the most variation, the goat PDGFA gene was sequenced and the protein localization was investigated by immunohistochemistry together with PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha). PDGFA immunostaining was observed in the basal layer of the HF outer root sheath and the immunoreaction appeared stronger in the regressive HFs compared to those in the anagen phase according to qPCR analysis. PDGFRalpha was observed in the HF epithelium, proving the effect of PDGFA on the follicular structure. The data obtained suggest that PDGFA and BMP2 are both implicated in HF cycle in goat.

MDCs were mixed with type I collagen and cultured for 7 days. One day after adding MECs on top, the composites were grafted onto nude mice. MDCs cultured on a two-dimensional (2D) plate for 7 days and mixed with MECs as a negative control, and freshly isolated MDCs and MECs mixture (chamber assay) as a positive control were also grafted. Six weeks after grafting, regenerated hair follicles were analysed. Our 3D skin equivalent culture assay reproducibly regenerated hair follicles, while MDCs precultured in the 2D model with MECs did not. Compared to the chamber assay, which produced randomly oriented hair follicles, nearly all regenerated hair follicles in our assay extruded through the skin and numerous regenerated hair follicles were higher than those in the chamber assay. Several representative genes associated with hair induction showed higher expression in our assay than in the 2D model. When Wnt3a was added, the number of regenerated hairs increased.

BACKGROUND: Hair fibre length is an important economic trait of rabbits in fur production. However, molecular mechanisms regulating rabbit hair growth have remained elusive. RESULTS: Here we aimed to characterise the skin traits and gene expression profiles of short-hair and long-hair rabbits by histological and transcriptome analyses. Haematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to observe the histological structure of the skin of short-hair and long-hair rabbits. Compared to that in short-hair rabbits, a significantly longer anagen phase was observed in long-hair rabbits. In addition, by RNA sequencing, we identified 951 genes that were expressed at significantly different levels in the skin of short-hair and long-hair rabbits. Nine significantly differentially expressed genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. A gene ontology analysis revealed that epidermis development, hair follicle development, and lipid metabolic process were significantly enriched. Further, we identified potential functional genes regulating follicle development, lipid metabolic, and apoptosis as well as important pathways including extracellular matrix-receptor interaction and basal cell carcinoma pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides transcriptome evidence for the differences in hair growth between short-hair and long-hair rabbits and reveals that lipid metabolism and apoptosis might constitute major factors contributing to hair length.",

Ancocyanin-rich blackcurrant extract (BCE) has phytoestrogen activity ; however, its effect on hair follicles is unknown. Additionally, hair loss is known to occur during menopause in women owing to decreased estrogen secretion. This study examined whether BCE alleviated female pattern hair loss using a rat model. RNA was extracted and analyzed using a microarray and ingenuity pathway analysis. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that 1 mug/mL BCE altered many genes downstream of beta-estradiol in human hair dermal papilla cells. Additionally, the expression of the hair follicle stem cell marker keratin 19 was greatly enhanced. In a menopause model, ovariectomized rats were fed a diet containing 3% BCE for three months. An analysis of the number of hair shafts revealed that BCE increased the number of hairs by 0. 5 hairs/follicular unit. Moreover, immunostaining revealed that the expression of Ki67 also increased by 19%. Furthermore, fluorescent immunostaining showed that the expression of other stem cell markers, including keratin 15, CD34, and keratin 19, was induced in rat hair follicular cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that BCE has phytoestrogen activity in hair follicles and contributes to the alleviation of hair loss in a menopausal model in rats.",

BACKGROUND: Biopsy-based \" \" reversal hypothesis \" \" claimed conversion of miniaturized hair follicles into terminal ones for the improvement of male pattern hair loss (MPHL) with FDA-approved drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MPHL volunteers (n = 13) completed a 24-month phototrichogram study. After 2 months no-treatment, panellists took finasteride 1mg daily for 2 years.

RESULTS: Due to the wide range of hair growth variables, no parameter was statistically significantly changed by finasteride in the group. Clinically there were 4 worse, 6 no change, 2 slightly and 1 moderately improved subject associated with turning telogen/empty terminal follicles into anagen after 12-and 24-month finasteride.

The hair follicle is a complex structure that goes through a cyclic period of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen) under the regulation of several signaling pathways, including Wnt/beta-catenin, FGF, Shh, and Notch. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is specifically involved in hair follicle morphogenesis, regeneration, and growth. beta-catenin is expressed in the dermal papilla and promotes anagen induction and duration, as well as keratinocyte regulation and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated the activation of beta-catenin by a polyphenolic compound 3, 4, 5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid (TCQA) in mice model and in human dermal papilla cells to promote hair growth cycle. A complete regrowth of the shaved area of C3H mice was observed upon treatment with TCQA. Global gene expression analysis using microarray showed an upregulation in hair growth-associated genes. Moreover, the expression of beta-catenin was remarkably upregulated in vivo and in vitro.

Background: Various treatment modalities exist for vitiligo, yet none of them are curative. Vitiligo is still considered a challenging disease to manage. Surgical treatment offers an excellent option for patients with stable vitiligo, especially those who fail to respond to medical treatment. Cell suspension techniques carry the advantage of covering large surface areas. Objective: To compare noncultured extracted hair follicle outer root sheath cell suspension (NCORSHFS) and noncultured epidermal cell suspension (NCES) in producing repigmentation. Subjects and Methods: Twenty patients were randomly allocated into two groups. They were objectively evaluated for the extent of repigmentation (after 1, 2, and 3 months), complications, cosmetic outcome, and satisfaction. Results: In NCORSHFS group, 10% showed excellent pigmentation, 20% showed good pigmentation, 50% fair, and 20% poor pigmentation. In NCES group, 10% showed excellent pigmentation, 10% good pigmentation, 40% fair, and 40% poor pigmentation. This difference was not statistically significant. Excellent color match was observed in 80% of NCORSHFS and in 70% of NCES. Donor area complications were absent in NCORSHFS group, whereas in NCES, mild scarring in 20% and hyperpigmentation in 40% of patients was observed. The difference in patients ' satisfaction between the two groups was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Both NCORSHFS and NCES are effective in producing good repigmentation with perfect color match and patients ' satisfaction. NCORSHFS has no donor area complications because it is a scarless procedure.",

    "text": "An osteopontin-derived peptide inhibits human hair growth at least in part by decreasing fibroblast growth factor-7 production in outer root sheath keratinocytes. BACKGROUND: Given that unwanted hair growth (hirsutism, hypertrichosis) can cause major psychological distress, new pharmacological treatment strategies with safe and effective hair growth inhibitors that do not destroy the hair follicle (HF) and its stem cells need to be developed. OBJECTIVES: To establish if osteopontin-derived fragments may modulate human hair growth given that human HFs express the multifunctional, immunomodulatory glycoprotein, osteopontin. METHODS: Our hypothesis was tested ex vivo and in vivo by using a newly generated, toxicologically well-characterized, modified osteopontin-derived peptide (FOL-005), which binds to the HF. RESULTS: In organ-cultured human HFs and scalp skin, and in human scalp skin xenotransplants onto SCID mice, FOL-005 treatment (60 nmol L-1 to 3 mumol L-1) significantly promoted premature catagen development without reducing the number of keratin 15-positive HF stem cells or showing signs of drug toxicity. Genome-wide DNA microarray, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry revealed decreased expression of the hair growth promoter, fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF7) by FOL-005, while cotreatment of HFs with recombinant FGF7 partially abrogated FOL-005-induced catagen promotion. CONCLUSIONS: With caveats in mind, our study identifies this osteopontin-derived peptide as an effective, novel inhibitory principle for human hair growth ex vivo and in vivo, which deserves systematic clinical testing in hirsutism and hypertrichosis. What ' s already known about this topic ? The treatment of unwanted hair growth (hypertrichosis, hirsutism) lacks pharmacological intervention, with only few and often unsatisfactory treatments available. Osteopontin is prominently expressed in human HFs and has been reported to be elevated during catagen in the murine hair cycle. What does this study add ? We tested the effects on hair growth of a novel, osteopontin-derived fragment (FOL-005) ex vivo and in vivo. In human hair follicles, high-dose FOL-005 significantly reduces hair growth both ex vivo and in vivo. What is the translational message ? High-dose FOL-005 may provide a new therapeutic opportunity as a treatment for unwanted hair growth.",

The most common postoperative complication after reconstructive surgery is flap necrosis. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and their secretomes are reported to mediate skin repair. This study was designed to investigate whether conditioned media from ADSCs (ADSC-CM) protects ischemia/reperfusion-(I/R-) induced injury in skin flaps by promoting cell proliferation and increasing the number of hair follicles. The mouse flap model of ischemia was ligating the long thoracic vessels for 3 h, followed by blood reperfusion. ADSC-CM was administered to the flaps, and their survival was observed on postoperative day 5. ADSC-CM treatment led to a significant increase in cell proliferation and the number of hair follicles. IL-6 levels in the lysate and CM from ADSCs were significantly higher than those from Hs68 fibroblasts. Furthermore, a strong decrease in cell proliferation and the number of hair follicles was observed after treatment with IL-6-neutralizing antibodies or si-IL-6-ADSC. In addition, ADSC transplantation increased flap repair, cell proliferation, and hair follicle number in I/R injury of IL-6-knockout mice. In conclusion, IL-6 secreted from ADSCs promotes the survival of I/R-induced flaps by increasing cell proliferation and the number of hair follicles.

AIMS: Pantothenic acid (PA) has been applied to treat alopecia, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Our study aims to explore the underlying mechanism of PA in regulating hair follicle (HF) growth. MAIN METHODS: Mink HFs and dermal papilla (DP) cells were isolated and cultured in vitro. HFs and DP cells were treated with 0, 10, 20, 40 mug/ml PA. The effect of PA on HF growth, DP cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, cell migration, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expressions in DP cells was measured. Moreover, the effect of PA on inhibitor of DNA binding 3 (ID3)/Notch signaling pathway was analyzed. Subsequently, ID3 was silenced to validate whether ID3/Notch signaling pathway was involved in regulating DP cell proliferation by PA. KEY FINDINGS: Both 20 mug/ml and 40 mug/ml PA promoted HF growth, G1/S transition of DP cells and IGF-1 and VEGF expressions in DP cells, while only 20 mug/ml PA promoted cell viability and the migration of DP cells. Thus 20 mug/ml PA was chosen for the following experiments. PA treatment was found to up-regulate ID3 expression but down-regulate Notch receptor 1 (Notch1) and Notch signaling targets expressions.

Persistent hair loss is a major cause of psychological distress and compromised quality of life in millions of people worldwide. Remarkable progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of hair loss and identifying valid intracellular targets for designing effective therapies for hair loss treatment. Whereas a variety of growth factors and signaling pathways have been implicated in hair cycling process, the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays a central role in hair follicle regeneration. Several plant-derived chemicals have been reported to promote hair growth by activating Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in various in vitro and in vivo studies.

In this study, we studied the changes of hair follicles induced by ischemia and potential effects of normobaric hyperoxygenation (NBO) on the hair cycle and growth. We found that skin ischemia reduced hair growth rate, hair shaft size, and its pigmentation in the anagen phase of mice, which may reflect an aspect of pathophysiology of hair loss (alopecia) and depigmentation (gray/white hairs). Hyperoxygenation increased hair growth rate in organ culture of both human and murine hair follicles. Systemic NBO promoted hair growth in early anagen and mid-anagen, and delayed catagen onset in mice. However, telogen-to-anagen transition was not affected by NBO as far as non-ischemic skin is concerned. The results of this study indicated that the hair follicle is very sensitive to oxygen tension and oxygen tension affects the regulation of hair growth and cycle in vitro and in vivo. It was suggested that systemic NBO can be safely applied for a long period and can be a noninvasive therapeutic approach to alter hair growth and cycle by manipulating the microenvironment of hair follicles.",

The aim of the study was comparative evaluation of the clinical efficacy of PRP-therapy, minoxidil, and their combination in the treatment of men with AGA and to evaluate the effects of PRP on the proliferation of hair follicle (HF) cells in skin biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 69 men who were divided into 3 groups who received PRP therapy, minoxidil, and their combination. The clinical efficacy of the therapy was evaluated by the dynamics of morphometric of hairs. To assess cell proliferation antibodies to beta-catenin, CD34, Ki67, and to Dkk-1 were used. RESULTS: PRP treatment was more effective than minoxidil therapy (p = 0. 005). Complex therapy turned out to be more effective than minoxidil monotherapy (p < 0. 0001) and PRP monotherapy (p = 0. 007). After applying PRP the absolute and relative values of the beta-catenin and CD34 expression area increased ; an increase in Ki67 + index was also significant. CONCLUSIONS: PRP can be considered as a treatment option for AGA. Combined PRP and minoxidil use seems promising for the treatment of AGA.

BACKGROUND: Mechanisms involved in hair metabolism are diverse, and the availability of ingredients that normalize dysfunctions or mitigate the effects of extrinsic stress suffered daily is greatly desired by consumers to improve the aesthetic appearance of hair. AIMS: In this work, we carried out a preclinical exploratory approach to evaluate the effects of a complex of nanoencapsulated active ingredients (AcPi), as well as a cosmetic formulation containing AcPi (ShPi and HtPi) in mechanisms involving hair loss and follicular aging. METHODS: Human hair follicle dermal papilla cells and human scalp culture were treated with AcPi, ShPi, or HtPi and stimulated with UV radiation or testosterone for further measurement of mitochondrial biogenesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), beta-catenin, dyhidrotestosterone (DHT), collagen XVIIalpha1 (COL17A1), and cutaneous permeation. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that AcPi prevents oxidative stress and balances mitochondial activity disturbed by exposure to UV radiation. AcPi also promoted an enrichment of WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway, stimulating hair growth, and lengthening the anagen phase of hair cycle. ShPi and HtPi were able to prevent hair aging, minimizing the excessive degradation of COL17A1 in hair follicle exposed to UV radiation, in addition to controlling androgenic metabolism by reducing DHT production. CONCLUSION: The integral effects of AcPi have not been completely elucidated ; however, these results, associated with clinical evidences, allow us to infer that this ingredient prevents follicular aging, miniaturization, and consequently hair loss by mechanisms involving energetic homeostasis maintenance, antioxidant, and anti-androgenic actions.",

    "text": "Quantifying the impact of braiding and combing on the integrity of natural African hair. BACKGROUND: Afro hair breakage is most commonly attributed to grooming practices such as braiding, hair extensions and weaves, both for chemically treated hair and natural Afro hair. These grooming practices are also frequently associated with traction alopecia in clinical studies. However, there is little to no quantitative scientific data on the surface and internal hair fibre damage caused by grooming, including combing, on Afro hair. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, cuticle cohesion and tensile testing were used to determine the effects of frequent braiding on the integrity of female Afro hair in 15 frequent braiders and 15 occasional braiders (control group) in Johannesburg, South Africa. Frequent braiders were women who braided more than 8 times per year, while occasional braiders typically limit braiding to only twice 2 per year. The severity of traction alopecia was quantified in both groups using the standard Marginal Traction Alopecia Scoring system. Surface damage on naturally curly Afro hair, that was combed but not braided, was assessed as another hairstyle option. RESULTS: All measurements showed a relationship between surface and internal hair fibre damage and braiding frequency. Frequent braiders had thinner hair, with more cuticle damage as shown by SEM and cuticle cohesion assessments. Their hair fibres were also significantly weaker (p < 0. 05), as shown by the tensile testing. In addition, they also had higher traction alopecia severity scores. In the combing impact assessment, a linear trend was observed between surface hair fibre damage and the number of combing strokes. Cuticle damage from 480 combing strokes was more severe than that from frequent braiding. CONCLUSION: Frequent braiding and combing damage natural Afro hair. Quantification of damage caused by different grooming practices identifies a need to develop products that could help mitigate specific hair damage associated with grooming practices. The degree of damage and subsequent hair loss could also be minimized by education on best braiding practices to protect the hair fibre and avoid hair follicle miniaturization caused by high traction hairstyles.",

    "text": "Inhibition of pyruvate oxidation as a versatile stimulator of the hair cycle in models of alopecia. Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are known to be responsible for the initiation of a new hair cycle, but typically remain quiescent for very long periods. In alopecia, or hair loss disorders, follicles can be refractory to activation for years or even permanently. Alopecia can be triggered by autoimmunity, age, chemotherapeutic treatment, stress, disrupted circadian rhythm or other environmental insults. We previously showed that hair follicle stem cells and the hair cycle can be manipulated by regulation of pyruvate entry into mitochondria for subsequent oxidation to fuel the TCA cycle in normal adult mice with typical hair cycling. Here, we present new data from our efforts to develop murine models of alopecia based on environmental triggers that have been shown to do the same in human skin. We found that inhibition of pyruvate transport into mitochondria can accelerate the hair cycle even during refractory hair cycling due to age, repeated chemotherapeutic treatment and stress. Hair cycle acceleration in these alopecia models led to the formation of histologically normal hair follicles within 30-40 days of treatment without any overt signs of toxicity or deleterious effects. Therefore, we propose inhibition of pyruvate entry into mitochondria as a versatile treatment strategy for alopecia in humans.",

BACKGROUND: Hair shaft diameter is one of the most important factors for the outcome of follicular unit extraction (FUE) surgery. In fact, the hair shaft is elliptical. Therefore, it has a long and short axis. Many hair transplantation surgeons use manual micrometer caliper for gauging hair diameter and use the results in the management of recipient and donor area. AIM: In this study, we aimed to identify the dependability of micrometer caliper and also the hair diameter diversity pattern in the donor area. PATIENTS/METHODS: Two hundred and seventy hairs were collected from three males with androgenetic alopecia. Hair samples were obtained from the 1 cm2 boxes from superior to inferior at the mid-point of temporal, parietal, and occipital donor areas. The diameter of each hair was measured both with a micrometer caliper and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Average diameter measured by scanning electron microscopy was 83. 01 microm for the long axis and 51. 51 microm for the short axis. The average value for the micrometer caliper measurement was 53. 32 microm. Comparison of micrometer caliper results with the short-axis measurements of SEM revealed a strong significant correlation. The hair diameters from superior, middle, and inferior boxes revealed a tendency to decrease toward the inferior regions. CONCLUSIONS: A manual micrometer caliper is a dependable tool for planning FUE surgery, and it measures the short axis of the elliptical hair shaft. Hair diameter tends to decrease toward the inferior regions of the donor area.",

However, it is unclear how phototherapy affects melanocyte precursors and skin neural crest stem cells. Objective: To investigate the underlying mechanisms of narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) induced melanocyte lineage differentiated from human scalp-derived neural crest stem cells (HS-NCSCs). Methods: HS-NCSCs were expanded from scalp hair follicles. The c-Kit-/CD57-HS-NCSCs were isolated by cell sorting. Different doses of NB-UVB were used to irradiate these HS-NCSCs. Cell ultrastructure was examined by transmission electron microscope. Melanocyte marker expression was analyzed by Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. Cell proliferation and migration were also evaluated. Results: The c-Kit-/CD57-HS-NCSCs expressed embryonic NCSC biomarkers. NB-UVB at a dose of 100 mJ of NB-UVB had little effect on the cell proliferation of differentiated melanocytes from c-Kit-/CD57-HS-NCSCs, while 700 mJ inhibited cell proliferation significantly. The dendritic processes of differentiated melanocytes increased after radiation. The tyrosinase and Melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1R) expression of differentiated melanocytes increased after NB-UVB exposure. The effect of NB-UVB on tyrosinase expression was modulated by signaling inhibitors H89 and PD98059 as well as Mc1R level in the cells. The migration ability of differentiated melanocytes was enhanced under 100 mJ exposure. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that NB-UVB facilitates melanocytic differentiation of the HS-NCSCs and enhances migration of these cells. Mc1R and cAMP pathway play a critical role in NB-UVB induced melanocytic differentiation.",

Obesity is a worldwide epidemic that predisposes individuals to many age-associated diseases, but its exact effects on organ dysfunction are largely unknown1. Hair follicles-mini-epithelial organs that grow hair-are miniaturized by ageing to cause hair loss through the depletion of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) 2. Here we report that obesity-induced stress, such as that induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), targets HFSCs to accelerate hair thinning. Chronological gene expression analysis revealed that HFD feeding for four consecutive days in young mice directed activated HFSCs towards epidermal keratinization by generating excess reactive oxygen species, but did not reduce the pool of HFSCs. Integrative analysis using stem cell fate tracing, epigenetics and reverse genetics showed that further feeding with an HFD subsequently induced lipid droplets and NF-kappaB activation within HFSCs via autocrine and/or paracrine IL-1R signalling. These integrated factors converge on the marked inhibition of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signal transduction in HFSCs, thereby further depleting lipid-laden HFSCs through their aberrant differentiation and inducing hair follicle miniaturization and eventual hair loss. Conversely, transgenic or pharmacological activation of SHH rescued HFD-induced hair loss. These data collectively demonstrate that stem cell inflammatory signals induced by obesity robustly represses organ regeneration signals to accelerate the miniaturization of mini-organs, and suggests the importance of daily prevention of organ dysfunction.",

In aging, androgenic alopecia, and genetic hypotrichosis disorders, hair shaft miniaturization is often associated with hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) loss. However, the mechanism causing this stem cell depletion in vivo remains elusive. Here we show that hair shaft loss or a reduction in diameter shrinks the physical niche size, which results in mechanical compression of HFSCs and their apoptotic loss. Mechanistically, cell compression activates the mechanosensitive channel Piezo1, which triggers calcium influx. This confers tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) sensitivity in a hair-cycle-dependent manner in otherwise resistant HFSCs and induces ectopic apoptosis. Persistent hair shaft miniaturization during aging and genetic hypotrichosis disorders causes long-term HFSC loss by inducing continuous ectopic apoptosis through Piezo1. Our results identify an unconventional role of the inert hair shaft structure as a functional niche component governing HFSC survival and reveal a mechanosensory axis that regulates physical-niche-atrophy-induced stem cell depletion in vivo.",

To prepare a topical formulation of bimatoprost (BIM) with high skin permeability, we designed a solvent mixture system composed of ethanol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, cyclomethicone, and butylated hydroxyanisole, serving as a volatile solvent, nonvolatile co-solvent, spreading agent, and antioxidant, respectively. The ideal topical BIM formulation (BIM-TF # 5) exhibited 4. 60-fold higher human skin flux and a 529% increase in dermal drug deposition compared to BIM in ethanol. In addition, compared to the other formulations, BIM-TF # 5 maximally activated human dermal papilla cell proliferation at a concentration of 5 muM BIM, equivalent to 10 muM minoxidil. Moreover, BIM-TF # 5 (0. 3% [w/w] BIM) significantly promoted hair regrowth in the androgenic alopecia mouse model and increased the area covered by hair at 10 days by 585% compared to the vehicle-treated mice, indicating that entire telogen area transitioned into the anagen phase. Furthermore, at day 14, the hair weight of mice treated with BIM-TF # 5 (5% [w/w] BIM) was 8. 45-and 1. 30-fold greater than in the 5% (w/w) BIM in ethanol and 5% (w/v) minoxidil treated groups, respectively. In the histological examination, the number and diameter of hair follicles in the deep subcutis were significantly increased in the BIM-TF # 5 (0. 3 or 5% [w/w] BIM)-treated mice compared to the mice treated with vehicle or 5% (w/w) BIM in ethanol. Thus, our findings suggest that BIM-TF # 5 is an effective formulation to treat scalp alopecia, as part of a novel therapeutic approach involving direct prostamide F2alpha receptor-mediated stimulation of dermal papilla cells within hair follicles.",

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) affects physical and mental health with limited therapeutic options. Novel materials and delivery methods have considerable potential to improve the current paradigm of treatment. In this study, we used a novel plant nanoparticle of safflower oil body (SOB) loaded with human fibroblast growth factor 10 (hFGF10) to target hair follicles and accelerate hair regeneration in AGA mice with few adverse effects. Our data revealed that the average particle size of SOB-hFGF10 was 226. 73 +-9. 98 nm, with a spherical and uniform structure, and that SOB-hFGF10 was quicker to preferentially penetrate into hair follicles than hFGF2 alone. Using a mouse model of AGA, SOB-hFGF10 was found to significantly improve hair regeneration without any significant toxicity. Furthermore, SOB-hFGF10 inhibited dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 overproduction in macrophages in relation to hair follicle microinflammation, thereby enhancing the proliferation of dermal papilla cells. Overall, this study provides an applicable therapeutic method through targeting hair follicles and reducing microinflammation to accelerate hair regeneration in AGA.",

Background: Kartogenin is a heterocyclic compound able to promote the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of various cell types and induce cartilage-like tissue regeneration. However, the role of kartogenin in hair follicles (HFs), remains unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of kartogenin on the regulation of hair growth and hair growth cycle transition. Methods: The effects of kartogenin on the proliferation, cell cycle status, and migration of primary human outer root sheath cells (ORSCs) were evaluated by MTS assay, flow cytometry, Transwell and scratch assays, respectively. We exposed ORSCs to kartogenin (1 microM) and determined changes in mRNA and protein levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2/Smad signaling molecules by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunofluorescence. We also examined the effects of kartogenin (10 microM) on HFs in mice by histology following cutaneous injection. Results: Kartogenin enhanced ORSC proliferation and migration function in a dose-dependent manner, and downregulated the expression of TGF-beta2/Smad signaling molecules in vitro. Injection of kartogenin delayed catagen phase and increased regenerated hair length in mice in vivo. Conclusions: Kartogenin modulates HF growth and regulates the hair cycle and the TGF-beta2/Smad signaling pathway, providing a potential new approach for the treatment of hair loss.",

BACKGROUND: Lagerstroemia indica (L. indica) is reported to have diverse biological activities including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, neuro-regulatory, antidiabetic and antioxidant activity. AIMS: The purpose of the present study is to examine the potential of hair growth promotion and/or hair loss prevention by L. indica extract. PATIENTS/METHODS: The effects of L. indica on hair growth have been studied in human hair follicle dermal papillary (hHFDP) cells and follicular organ culture ex vivo by cell proliferation assay, PCR, western blot analysis and reporter gene activity assay. Moreover, a clinical trial was conducted in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: L. indica significantly promoted the proliferation of hHFDP cells, which was associated with increased expression of TCF/LEF, VEGF and Gli1 mRNA, and inhibition of STAT6 and Smad2 mRNA. Treatment with L. indica also increased the TCF/LEF reporter gene activity but downregulated the SBE-and STAT6-luciferase activities. The expression of total beta-catenin, CDK4 and CDK2 were elevated, while that of STAT6 and SMAD2/3 was suppressed upon treatment with L. indica. In human hair follicles organ culture, L. indica significantly inhibited hair follicular degeneration. The clinical trial showed a statistically significant rise in total hair count in test group (n = 24) after 24 weeks of applying the hair tonic enriched with L. indica (141. 46 +-21. 27 number/cm2, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: We suggest that L. indica extract prevents hair loss as well as stimulate hair growth by regulating the Wnt-beta-catenin, JAK3-STAT6 and TGF-beta1-Smad signaling pathways, and may be further developed as a novel functional cosmetic for preventing hair loss.",

BACKGROUND: Age-induced hair greying (AIHG) is one of the visual hallmarks of aging, but its biological mechanism remains unclear. Changes in the hair-follicle lipid profiles associated with AIHG have not been defined. OBJECTIVES: To define the differences in the hair follicle lipid profiles of female black and grey/white hair follicles. METHODS: The lipid profile of hair follicles was determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrapole time-of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). Multivariate data analysis was used to determine changes in the lipid profiles in hair follicle roots. RESULTS: We identified the different lipids in hair follicle roots between black hair (HB) and white hair (HW), and analyzed the key lipids that contribute to the development of HW. The results showed that the total lipid content of the HW was significantly reduced. There were significant differences in sphingolipid content, with HB higher than HW. Two subclasses, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and galactosylceramide, were significantly different. GlcCer, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid levels were higher in the HB group. The sphingolipid metabolism involved in GlcCer (d18: 1/24: 1 (15Z)) is a statistically significant lipid metabolic pathway. CONCLUSION: Five major individual lipid candidates are involved in the production of AIHG. GlcCer shows a significant reduction in HW and is a potential target for further research into AIHG.",

Among those tested, one type was shown capable of supporting the expression of stem cell markers in cultured HFSCs. However, both the differentiation potential and in vivo hair follicle-inducing ability of HFSCs serially passaged using that optimal medium were found to be impaired, probably because of altered responsiveness to Wnt signaling.

BACKGROUND: Finasteride and minoxidil are two commonly used drugs for the treatment of hair loss. However, these two drugs have certain side effects. Thus, the further elucidation of treatments for hair loss, including those using Chinese herbal medicine, remains important clinically. Shi-Bi-Man (SBM) is a hair health supplement that darkens hair and contains ginseng radix, tea polyphenols, polygonum multiflorum, radix angelicae sinensis, aloe, linseed, and green tea extract. PURPOSE: This study aimed to find potential effective monomer components to promote hair regeneration from SBM and to explore the mechanism of SBM to promote hair regeneration. METHODS: Supplementation with the intragastric administration or smear administration of SBM in artificially shaved C57BL/6 mice, observe its hair growth. UPLC/MS and UPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap-MS detect the main components in SBM and the main monomers contained in the skin after smearing, respectively. A network pharmacology study on the main components of SBM and single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to explore the role of SBM for hair regeneration. RESULTS: SBM significantly induced hair growth compared with a control treatment. TSG and EGCG were the main monomers in the skin after SBM smearing. The results of single-cell sequencing revealed that after SBM treatment, the number of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and dermal papilla cells (DPCs) increased significantly. Cell interactions and volcano dots show that the interaction of the FGF signaling pathway was significantly enhanced, in which Fgf7 expression was especially upregulated in DPCs. In addition, the Wnt signaling pathway also had a partially enhanced effect on the interactions between various cells in the skin. The network pharmacology study showed that the promotion of the FGF and Wnt pathways by SBM was also enriched in alopecia diseases. CONCLUSION: We report that SBM has a potential effect on the promotion of hair growth by mainly activating the FGF signaling pathway. The use of SBM may be a novel therapeutic option for hair loss.",

The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family has various biological functions, including cell growth, tissue regeneration, embryonic development, metabolism, and angiogenesis. In the case of hair growth, several members of the FGF family, such as FGF1 and FGF2, are involved in hair growth, while FGF5 has the opposite effect. In this study, the regulation of the hair growth cycle by FGF12 was investigated. To observe its effect, the expression of FGF12 was downregulated in mice and outer root sheath (ORS) by siRNA transfection, while FGF12 overexpression was carried out using FGF12 adenovirus. For the results, FGF12 was primarily expressed in ORS cells with a high expression during the anagen phase of hair follicles. Knockdown of FGF12 delayed telogen-to-anagen transition in mice and decreased the hair length in vibrissae hair follicles. It also inhibited the proliferation and migration of ORS cells. On the contrary, FGF12 overexpression increased the migration of ORS cells. FGF12-overexpressed ORS cells induced the telogen-to-anagen transition in the animal model. In addition, FGF12 overexpression regulated the expression of PDGF-CC, MDK, and HB-EGF, and treatment of these factors exhibited hair growth promotion. Altogether, FGF12 promoted hair growth by inducing the anagen phase of hair follicles, suggesting the potential for hair loss therapy.",

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is a non-scarring alopecia resulting from the progressive conversion of the terminal (t) scalp hair follicles (HFs) into intermediate/miniaturized (i/m) HFs. Although data supporting nutrient deficiency in FPHL HFs are lacking, therapeutic strategies are often associated with nutritional supplementation. Here, we show by metabolic analysis that selected nutrients important for hair growth such as essential amino acids and vitamins are indeed decreased in affected iHFs compared to tHFs in FPHL scalp skin, confirming nutrient insufficiency. iHFs also displayed a more quiescent metabolic phenotype, as indicated by altered metabolite abundance in freshly collected HFs and release/consumption during organ culture of products/substrates of TCA cycle, aerobic glycolysis, and glutaminolysis. Yet, as assessed by exogenous nutrient supplementation ex vivo, nutrient uptake mechanisms are not impaired in affected FPHL iHFs. Moreover, blood vessel density is not diminished in iHFs versus tHFs, despite differences in tHFs from different FPHL scalp locations or versus healthy scalp or changes in the expression of angiogenesis-associated growth factors.

Multiple Notch receptors and ligands are expressed in both developing and adult epidermis and hair follicles. Proliferation and differentiation of these two ectodermal-derived structures have been proposed to be controlled in part by the Notch pathway. Whether Notch signaling is involved in postnatal hair homeostasis is currently unknown. Here, we investigate and compare the role of the Notch1 receptor during embryonic hair follicle development and postnatal hair homeostasis using Cre-loxP based tissue specific and inducible loss-of-function approaches. During embryonic development, tissue-specific ablation of Notch1 does not perturb formation and patterning of hair follicle placodes. However, Notch1 deficient hair follicles invaginate prematurely into the dermis. Embryonic as well as postnatal inactivation of Notch1 shortly after birth or in adult mice results in almost complete hair loss followed by cyst formation. The first hair cycle of Notch1 deficient mice is characterized by shortened anagen and a premature entry into catagen. These data show that Notch1 is essential for late stages of hair follicle development during embryogenesis as well as for post-natal hair follicle development and hair homeostasis.",

Inbred laboratory mice have proven to be useful model systems for studying hair biology and pathomechanisms of hair loss. Fuzzy (fz) is an autosomal recessive mutation that results in hair coat abnormalities. Though this mutant has long been known, its cutaneous abnormalities still await systematic analysis. Here, we provide a systematic skin phenotype analysis of mice that are homozygous for Iasi congenital atrichia (fzica/fzica), which is allelic to fz. Homozygous mice exhibit a sparse hair coat after birth and completely loose their hair at around postnatal day 120. Although early and mid stages of hair follicle morphogenesis are normal, late hair follicle morphogenesis reveals multifocal cell degeneration within the Huxley layer of the inner root sheath (IRS) and a complete lack of the hair shaft medulla. In addition, hair follicle development is prematurely terminated by induction of the first postnatal hair cycle with premature entry into catagen. Subsequently, a dramatically shortened telogen is immediately followed by premature anagen development, resulting in a marked, generalized acceleration of hair follicle cycling. This suggests that fuzzy is not only involved in structural hair shaft integrity and differentiation of the IRS and medulla, but also plays an important role in the control of hair follicle cycling. Our data show that fuzzy is involved in controlling both catagen and anagen initiation, designating fuzzy an exciting target for characterizing the intracutaneous oscillator system that drives hair follicle cycling.",

We previously showed that the homeodomain protein HOXC13 is involved in the expression control of the early human hair keratin genes hHa5 and hHa2, which contain specific HOXC13 binding sites in their proximal promoters. Hox specificity is generally thought to be enhanced by the interaction with members of the TALE superclass of homeodomain proteins Pbx, Meis, and Prep. Using reverse transcription PCR with total human hair follicle RNA, we demonstrated transcripts of the major TALE proteins PBX1-4, MEIS1, 2 and PREP1, 2 in the human hair follicle. In view of the presence of MEIS/PREP responsive elements in close vicinity to the HOXC13 binding sites of the hHa5 and hHa2 promoters, we determined the expression sites of these TALE proteins in the human hair follicle. We found that MEIS1, MEIS2, PREP1 and PREP2 were differentially expressed in the three layers of the inner root sheath. In addition, MEIS2 and PREP1 exhibited expression in the mid-to upper hair cortex, with PREP1 being also expressed in the dermal papilla and the connective tissue sheath of the hair follicle. In virtually all cases, the expression of these TALE proteins was exclusively cytoplasmic. Considering that in contrast, HOXC13 is expressed in the nuclei of matrix, precortex and lower cuticle cells of the hair follicle, our data suggest that despite the presence of MEIS/PREP binding sites in the hHa5 and hHa2 promoters, the HOXC13-controlled activation of these genes in the hair follicle does not seem to involve these TALE proteins as cofactors.",

The fluorescent protein GFP, whose expression is driven by the nestin regulatory element in transgenic mice, served to mark the follicle cell fate. The pluripotent nestin-driven GFP stem cells are positive for the stem cell marker CD34 but negative for keratinocyte marker keratin 15, suggesting their relatively undifferentiated state. These cells can differentiate into neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, and melanocytes in vitro. In vivo studies show the nestin-driven GFP hair follicle stem cells can differentiate into blood vessels and neural tissue after transplantation to the subcutis of nude mice. Equivalent hair follicle stem cells derived from transgenic mice with beta-actin-driven GFP implanted into the gap region of a severed sciatic nerve greatly enhance the rate of nerve regeneration and the restoration of nerve function. The follicle cells transdifferentiate largely into Schwann cells, which are known to support neuron regrowth. Function of the rejoined sciatic nerve was measured by contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle upon electrical stimulation. After severing the tibial nerve and subsequent transplantation of hair follicle stem cells, walking print length and intermediate toe spread significantly recovered, indicating that the transplanted mice recovered the ability to walk normally.

Follicles were categorized into four groups according to hair growth and some were cultured ex vivo for 6 days. Follicles showed considerable variations with respect to hair growth and follicle length ; however, these two variables were relatively well correlated. Hair growth in culture was closely related with hair growth rate in vivo.

The human hair follicle is a unique appendage which results from epithelio-mesenchymal interactions initiated around the 3rd month of development. This appendage has a very complex structure, with a dermal compartment and an epithelial compartment. The dermal compartment comprises the connective tissue sheath and the dermal papilla, both of which are irrigated by microvessels. The epithelial compartment is made of highly replicating matrix cells giving rise to three concentrical domains, namely the outer root sheath, the inner root sheath and the hair shaft. The pigmentation unit, responsible for hair color, is made of fully active melanocytes located on top of the dermal papilla. Altogether a hair follicle contains more than 20 different cell types, engaged in different differentiation pathways and/or interacting with each other. This complex appendage has a unique behavior in mammals since, after a hair production phase, it involutes in place before entering a resting phase after which it renews itself under a cyclical but stochastic way, out of a double reservoir of pluripotent stem cells able to also regenerate epidermis. For yet unknown reasons, this well ordered process can be disturbed, provoking alopecia. The pigmentation unit also renews itself under a cyclical way, out of a melanocyte progenitor reservoir which progressively declines with time, provoking the hair whitening process. Finally, the shape of the hair shaft is programmed from the bulb. What makes this appendage unique and fascinating is its high degree of autonomy, its incredibly complex though stable structure, the number of different cell types interacting under an equilibrated way and its potential of regeneration. It represents a true paradigm of tissue homeostasis, exemplifying in a small living cylinder all the fundamental laws of cell-cell and tissue interactions.

Oxidative stress is generated by a multitude of environmental and endogenous challenges such as radiation, inflammation, or psychoemotional stress. It also speeds the aging process. Graying is a prominent but little understood feature of aging. Intriguingly, the continuous melanin synthesis in the growing (anagen) hair follicle generates high oxidative stress. We therefore hypothesize that hair bulb melanocytes are especially susceptible to free radical-induced aging. To test this hypothesis, we subjected human scalp skin anagen hair follicles from graying individuals to macroscopic and immunohistomorphometric analysis and organ culture. We found evidence of melanocyte apoptosis and increased oxidative stress in the pigmentary unit of graying hair follicles. The \" \" common \" \" deletion, a marker mitochondrial DNA-deletion for accumulating oxidative stress damage, occurred most prominently in graying hair follicles. Cultured unpigmented hair follicles grew better than pigmented follicles of the same donors. Finally, cultured pigmented hair follicles exposed to exogenous oxidative stress (hydroquinone) showed increased melanocyte apoptosis in the hair bulb. We conclude that oxidative stress is high in hair follicle melanocytes and leads to their selective premature aging and apoptosis. The graying hair follicle, therefore, offers a unique model system to study oxidative stress and aging and to test antiaging therapeutics in their ability to slow down or even stop this process. \"",

The pigmentation unit, responsible for hair color, is made of fully active melanocytes located on top of the dermal papilla. This complex appendage has a unique behavior in mammals since, after a hair production phase, it involutes in situ before entering a resting phase after which it renews in a cyclical but stochastic fashion, out of a double reservoir of pluripotent stem cells also to able regenerate epidermis. The pigmentation unit also renews in a cyclical fashion, out of a melanocyte progenitor reservoir which progressively declines with time, provoking the hair whitening process. Finally, the shape of the hair shaft is programmed from the bulb. The hair follicle thus behaves as a fully autonomous skin appendage with its own hormonal control, its own autocrine and paracrine network, its own cycle, appearing as an incredibly complex and stable structure which summarizes the main rules of tissue homeostasis.",

It is increasingly evident that the molecular mechanisms underlying hair follicle differentiation and cycling recapitulate principles of embryonic patterning and organ regeneration. Here we used Hoxc13-overexpressing transgenic mice (also known as GC13 mice), known to develop severe hair growth defects and alopecia, as a tool for defining pathways of hair follicle differentiation. Gene array analysis performed with RNA from postnatal skin revealed differential expression of distinct subsets of genes specific for cells of the three major hair shaft compartments (cuticle, cortex, and medulla) and their precursors. This finding correlates well with the structural defects observed in each of these compartments and implicates Hoxc13 in diverse pathways of hair follicle differentiation. The group of medulla-specific genes was particularly intriguing because this included the developmentally regulated transcription factor-encoding gene Foxq1 that is altered in the medulladefective satin mouse hair mutant. We provide evidence that Foxq1 is a downstream target for Hoxc13 based on DNA binding studies as well as co-transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Expression of additional medulla-specific genes down-regulated upon overexpression of Hoxc13 requires functional Foxq1 as their expression is ablated in hair follicles of satin mice. Combined, these results demonstrate that Hoxc13 and Foxq1 control medulla differentiation through a common regulatory pathway. The apparent regulatory interactions between members of the mammalian Hox and Fox gene families shown here may establish a paradigm for \" \" cross-talk \" \" between these two conserved regulatory gene families in different developmental contexts including embryonic patterning as well as organ development and renewal. \"",

Deletion of jagged 1 (Jag1) results in inhibition of the hair growth cycle and conversion of hair follicles into cysts of cells undergoing interfollicular epidermal differentiation. Conversely, activation of Notch in adult epidermis triggers expansion of the base of the hair follicle, sebaceous gland enlargement and abnormal clumping of the follicles. In adult epidermis, the induction of new hair follicle formation by beta-catenin is prevented by blocking Notch signalling pharmacologically or through Jag1 deletion. Conversely, activation of both pathways accelerates growth and differentiation of ectopic follicles. beta-catenin stimulates Notch signalling by inducing Jag1 transcription.

Unlike the dissociated DP cells, the spheres made from the later passaged cells (more than 10 passages) did induce new hair follicles. We examined several genes specific for DP of anagen follicles and confirmed that their expression level was elevated in the spheres compared with their expression level in adherent DP cells.

Therefore, we have explored whether microdissected, organ-cultured, human scalp hair follicles (HFs) in anagen VI can be exploited for dissecting and manipulating the impact of chemotherapy on human HFs.

In addition, 4-HC induced DNA oxidation and the mitochondrial DNA common deletion.

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is key for cell survival, migration, and adhesion, but little is known about its role in epidermal development and homeostasis in vivo. We generated mice with conditional inactivation of the Ilk gene in squamous epithelia. These mice die perinatally and exhibit skin blistering and severe defects in hair follicle morphogenesis, including greatly reduced follicle numbers, failure to progress beyond very early developmental stages, and pronounced defects in follicular keratinocyte proliferation. ILK-deficient epidermis shows abnormalities in adhesion to the basement membrane and in differentiation. ILK-deficient cultured keratinocytes fail to attach and spread efficiently and exhibit multiple abnormalities in actin cytoskeletal organization. Ilk gene inactivation in cultured keratinocytes causes impaired ability to form stable lamellipodia, to directionally migrate, and to polarize. These defects are accompanied by abnormal distribution of active Cdc42 to cell protrusions, as well as reduced activation of Rac1 upon induction of cell migration in scraped keratinocyte monolayers. Significantly, alterations in cell spreading and forward movement in single cells can be rescued by expression of constitutively active Rac1 or RhoG. Our studies underscore a central and distinct role for ILK in hair follicle development and in polarized cell movements, two key aspects of epithelial morphogenesis and function.",

OBJECTIVE: To improve the method of obtaining purified and viable human hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) from bulge cells (BCs). METHODS: Firstly, the BCs were isolated from human hair follicles by microdissection. Secondly, the CD200 + HFSCs were selected from BCs using magnetic cell sorting method. The viability of these purified HFSCs was detected under light microscope. The purification rate was analyzed by flow cytometry. The pre-and post-purification cells were compared by immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: The adherent BCs displayed a typical cobblestone morphology on day 6. The BCs expressed K19 strongly. The viability rate of pre-purification cells was 95. 0% +/-0. 6% while that of post-purification cells was 94. 2% +/-1. 0%. There was no significant difference (P < 0. 05). By flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining examination, the CD200 + cell rate was 8. 31% before cell sorting purification while that was 82. 31% after cell sorting purification. CONCLUSION: Highly purified and viable HFSCs could be obtained by micromani pulation and magnetic cell sorting assay.",

The frequency of SC divisions and the chromosome-sorting phenomenon are difficult to examine accurately with existing methods. To address this question, we developed a strategy to count divisions of hair follicle (HF) SCs over time, and provide the first quantitative proliferation history of a tissue SC during its normal homoeostasis. We uncovered an unexpectedly high cellular turnover in the SC compartment in one round of activation. Our study provides quantitative data in support of the long-standing infrequent SC division model, and shows that HF SCs do not retain the older DNA strands or sort their chromosome.

Since the discovery of epithelial hair follicle stem cells (eHFSCs) in the bulge of human hair follicles (HFs) an important quest has started: to define useful markers. In the current study, we contribute to this by critically evaluating corresponding published immunoreactivity (IR) patterns, and by attempting to identify markers for the in situ identification of human eHFSCs and their niche. For this, human scalp skin cryosections of at least five different individuals were examined, employing standard immunohistology as well as increased sensitivity methods. Defined reference areas were compared by quantitative immunohistochemistry for the relative intensity of their specific IR. According to our experience, the most useful positive markers for human bulge cells turned out to be cytokeratin 15, cytokeratin 19 and CD200, but were not exclusive, while beta1 integrin and Lhx2 IR were not upregulated by human bulge keratinocytes. Absent IR for CD34, connexin43 and nestin on human bulge cells may be exploited as negative markers. alpha6 integrin, fibronectin, nidogen, fibrillin-1 and latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-binding protein-1 were expressed throughout the connective tissue sheath of human HFs. On the other hand, tenascin-C was upregulated in the bulge and may thus constitute a component of the bulge stem cell niche of human HFs. These immunophenotyping results shed further light on the in situ expression patterns of claimed follicular ' stem cell markers ' and suggest that not a single marker alone but only the use of a limited corresponding panel of positive and negative markers may offer a reasonable and pragmatic compromise for identifying human bulge stem cells in situ.",

Several types of adult stem cells are capable of transdifferentiaton into other types of tissues.

We demonstrate that the bulge KSCs have the potential for transdifferentiation into corneal epithelial-like cells. Bulge KSCs isolated by collagen type IV adhesiveness possessed the highest colony formation efficiency (CFE), and expressed specific markers (CD34 and alpha6-integrin). The isolated cells transdifferentiate into corneal epithelial-like cells in conditioned medium containing corneal limbus soluble factors, including their specific marker, keratin12. The transdifferentiation depends on upregulation of pax6 and downregulation of beta-catenin and Lef-1. Furthermore, overexpression of pax6 in bulge KSCs induced their expression of k12. The expressions of beta-catenin and Lef-1 were not suppressed in the pax6-transfected bulge KSCs, but which were downregulated pax6-transfected cells cultured in the conditioned medium.

    "text": "The ' melanocyte-keratin ' mystery revisited: neither normal human epidermal nor hair follicle melanocytes express keratin 16 or keratin 6 in situ. BACKGROUND: Keratin family proteins are generally accepted as being restricted to epithelial cells. However, several studies have challenged this paradigm by reporting, for example, that melanoma cells can express keratins and that normal human epidermal melanocytes, which derive from the neural crest, express keratin 16 (K16) in situ. OBJECTIVES: We wished to confirm or refute that K16 and/or its intermediate filament partner, keratin 6 (K6), are expressed in normal human epidermal and/or hair follicle melanocytes in situ. METHODS: Cryosections of normal human scalp skin were subjected to highly sensitive double immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies against K16 or K6 and against the melanocyte-specific marker NKI/beteb (gp100). Immunoreactivity (IR) was visualized by conventional light microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Despite the use of different, high-sensitivity immunostaining methods, stringent positive and negative controls, and monospecific, well-characterized antikeratin antibodies, we could detect neither K16 nor K6 IR within intraepidermal or intrafollicular pigment cells of normal human scalp skin. Instead, NKI/beteb + cells were found to be intimately embedded in foci of K16 + and/or K6 + keratinocytes, which might create the illusion of keratin expression by these cells. CONCLUSIONS: Human epidermal or hair follicle melanocytes do not express K16 and/or K6 while residing in their natural habitat.",

    "text": "Corneodesmosin gene ablation induces lethal skin-barrier disruption and hair-follicle degeneration related to desmosome dysfunction. Corneodesmosin (CDSN) is specific to desmosomes of epithelia undergoing cornification, mainly the epidermis and the inner root sheath of the hair follicles. CDSN nonsense mutations are associated with hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp, a rare disease that leads to complete baldness in young adults. CDSN displays adhesive properties, mostly attributable to its N-terminal glycine-rich domain, and is sequentially proteolyzed as corneocytes migrate towards the skin surface. K14-promoter driven Cre-mediated deletion of Cdsn in mice resulted in neonatal death as a result of epidermal tearing upon minor mechanical stress. Ultrastructural analyses revealed a desmosomal break at the interface between the living and cornified layers. After grafting onto nude mice, knockout skin showed a chronic defect in the epidermal permeability barrier. The epidermis was first hyperproliferative with a thick cornified layer, then, both the epidermis and the hair follicles degenerated. In adults, Cdsn deletion resulted in similar histological abnormalities and in a lethal barrier defect. We demonstrate that Cdsn is not essential for skin-barrier formation in utero, but is vital throughout life to preserve this barrier by maintaining desmosome integrity. The strong adhesive function that the protein confers on corneodesmosomes also seems necessary for maintaining the architecture of the hair follicle.",

The possible functional role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels was investigated by testing various TRP agonists and antagonists in an isolated rat sinus hair follicle preparation. Extracellular recordings from slowly adapting type II mechanoreceptor units were made. The antagonist capsazepine depressed spontaneous and mechanically evoked activity, with an IC (50) of 82 microM. In one-third of units, capsazepine caused a selective depression of mechanically evoked firing, such that the existing spontaneous firing was interrupted by an absence of activity during the mechanical stimulus. The broad spectrum TRP blocker ruthenium red (30 microM) had inconsistent effects, although in some units a delayed onset (following wash) bursting and paroxysmal firing ensued. The agonist icilin (50-100 microM) had an excitatory effect on spontaneous firing, and (-)-menthol (200 microM) had inconsistent effects. Cinnamaldehyde (1-2 mM) depressed all types of activity equally, mechanically evoked and spontaneous. Camphor (0. 5-2 mM) also depressed all types of activity, although it had a preferential effect on spontaneous activity.

Confocal microscopy, on the other hand, is more efficient and readily applicable to study intact hair follicles. Modern confocal microscopes deliver and collect light very efficiently and thus allow high spatial resolution imaging of relatively thick samples. In this letter, we report that we successfully imaged entire intact human hair follicles using point scanning confocal microscopy. Light delivery and light-collection were further improved by preparing the samples in 2, 2 '-Thiodiethanol (TDE), thus reducing refractive index gradients.

The switch between black and yellow pigment is mediated by the interaction between Melanocortin receptor 1 (Mc1r) and its antagonist Agouti, but the genetic and developmental mechanisms that modify this interaction to obtain different coat color in distinct environments are poorly understood. Here, the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the regulation of pigment-type switching was studied. Loss and gain of function of beta-catenin in the dermal papilla (DP) of the hair follicle results in yellow and black animals, respectively. beta-Catenin activity in the DP suppresses Agouti expression and activates Corin, a negative regulator of Agouti activity. In addition, beta-catenin activity in the DP regulates melanocyte activity by a mechanism that is independent of both Agouti and Corin. The coordinate and inverse regulation of Agouti and Corin renders pelage pigmentation sensitive to changes in beta-catenin activity in the DP that do not alter pelage structure. As a result, the signals that specify two biologically distinct quantitative traits are partially uncoupled despite their common regulation by the beta-catenin pathway in the same cells.",

    "text": "Shh maintains dermal papilla identity and hair morphogenesis via a Noggin-Shh regulatory loop. During hair follicle morphogenesis, dermal papillae (DPs) function as mesenchymal signaling centers that cross-talk with overlying epithelium to regulate morphogenesis. While the DP regulates hair follicle formation, relatively little is known about the molecular basis of DP formation. The morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is known for regulating hair follicle epithelial growth, with excessive signaling resulting in basal cell carcinomas. Here, we investigate how dermal-specific Shh signaling contributes to DP formation and hair growth. Using a Cre-lox genetic model and RNAi in hair follicle reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that dermal Smoothened (Smo) loss of function results in the loss of the DP precursor, the dermal condensate, and a stage 2 hair follicle arrest phenotype reminiscent of Shh (-/-) skin. Surprisingly, dermal Smo does not regulate cell survival or epithelial proliferation. Rather, molecular screening and immunostaining studies reveal that dermal Shh signaling controls the expression of a subset of DP-specific signature genes. Using a hairpin/cDNA lentiviral system, we show that overexpression of the Shh-dependent gene Noggin, but not Sox2 or Sox18, can partially rescue the dermal Smo knockdown hair follicle phenotype by increasing the expression of epithelial Shh. Our findings suggest that dermal Shh signaling regulates specific DP signatures to maintain DP maturation while maintaining a reciprocal Shh-Noggin signaling loop to drive hair follicle morphogenesis.",

OBJECTIVE: Outer root sheath (ORS) cells of human hair follicles are a readily available, non-invasive source of keratinocytes for epidermis reconstruction. The aim of this study was to characterize a model of epidermis reconstructed from ORS cells (ORS-derived model) and to evaluate its reproducibility, in comparison with native human skin and two marketed reconstructed skin models (model A, Episkin () and model B, Skinethic ()). METHODS: Cell morphology and tissue architecture of the three models were analysed histologically and proliferation and differentiation marker expression by immunohistochemistry and mRNA quantification. RESULTS: All models displayed the same general epidermal architecture as native epidermis, but with a thicker stratum corneum in models A and B. Compared with native epidermis, Ki67 was correctly localized in epidermal basal cells in all models, as K10 in suprabasal layers. In all skin models, transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) was prematurely expressed in suprabasal layers. However, this expression was only observed from the upper stratum spinosum in the ORS-derived model. In this model, filaggrin and loricrin were correctly located in the stratum granulosum. Filaggrin, involucrin, loricrin and TGM1 mRNAs (markers of keratinocyte terminal differentiation) were transcriptionally expressed in all models. In the ORS-derived model, transcriptional expression level was similar to that of native skin. CONCLUSION: ORS cell-based reconstructed epidermis is a valid and reproducible model for human epidermis and it may be used to evaluate the effects of active substances and cosmetic formulations.",

Hair follicle-derived neural crest stem cells can be induced to differentiate into Schwann cells in vivo and in vitro. However, the underlying regulatory mechanism during cell differentiation remains poorly understood. This study isolated neural crest stem cells from human hair follicles and induced them to differentiate into Schwann cells. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that microRNA (miR)-21 expression was gradually increased during the differentiation of neural crest stem cells into Schwann cells. After transfection with the miR-21 agonist (agomir-21), the differentiation capacity of neural crest stem cells was enhanced. By contrast, after transfection with the miR-21 antagonist (antagomir-21), the differentiation capacity was attenuated. Further study results showed that SOX-2 was an effective target of miR-21. Without compromising SOX2 mRNA expression, miR-21 can down-regulate SOX protein expression by binding to the 3 '-UTR of miR-21 mRNA. Knocking out the SOX2 gene from the neural crest stem cells significantly reversed the antagomir-21 inhibition of neural crest stem cells differentiating into Schwann cells. The results suggest that miR-21 expression was increased during the differentiation of neural crest stem cells into Schwann cells and miR-21 promoted the differentiation through down-regulating SOX protein expression by binding to the 3 '-UTR of SOX2 mRNA.",

Dermal Papillae (DP) is a unique population of mesenchymal cells that was shown to regulate hair follicle formation and growth cycle. During development most DP cells are derived from mesoderm, however, functionally equivalent DP cells of cephalic hairs originate from Neural Crest (NC). Here we directed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to generate first NC cells and then hair-inducing DP-like cells in culture. We showed that hESC-derived DP-like cells (hESC-DPs) express markers typically found in adult human DP cells (e. g., p-75, nestin, versican, SMA, alkaline phosphatase) and are able to induce hair follicle formation when transplanted under the skin of immunodeficient NUDE mice. Engineered to express GFP, hESC-derived DP-like cells incorporate into DP of newly formed hair follicles and express appropriate markers. We demonstrated that BMP signaling is critical for hESC-DP derivation since BMP inhibitor dorsomorphin completely eliminated hair-inducing activity from hESC-DP cultures. DP cells were proposed as the cell-based treatment for hair loss diseases. Unfortunately human DP cells are not suitable for this purpose because they cannot be obtained in necessary amounts and rapidly loose their ability to induce hair follicle formation when cultured. In this context derivation of functional hESC-DP cells capable of inducing a robust hair growth for the first time shown here can become an important finding for the biomedical science.",

Hu sheep lambskin is a unique white lambskin from China that exhibits three types of flower patterns, including small waves, medium waves, and large waves, with small waves considered the best quality. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying flower pattern formation in Hu sheep lambskin is limited. The aim of the present study was to further explore the relevance between candidate microRNAs (miRNAs) and developmental characteristics of hair follicles and screen miRNAs for later functional validation. Herein, we employed Illumina Hiseq 2500 to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in hair follicles of different flower patterns with small, medium, and large waves to construct a comprehensive sequence database on the mechanism of hair follicle development. Paraffin sections of lambskin tissue were prepared to assess the structure of different hair follicles. Expression levels of candidate miRNAs in different flower patterns were analyzed by relative quantitation using real-time PCR, combined with histological observation and micro-observation technologies, and the correlation between expression levels of candidate miRNAs and histological properties of hair follicles was analyzed by using SPSS 17. 0. A total of 522 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, and RNA-seq analysis detected 7, 266 target genes in different groups of flower patterns. Gene ontological analysis indicated these target genes were mainly involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, growth, apoptosis, and ion transport, and 14 miRNAs, including miR-143, miR-10a, and let-7 were screened as candidate miRNAs in Hu sheep hair follicle growth and development. In the same field of vision, variance analysis showed that the number of secondary follicles in small waves was significantly larger than that in large and medium waves (P < 0. 01) ; the diameter of the primary and secondary follicles in large waves was respectively larger than those in medium and small waves (P < 0. 01). Combined with correlation analysis between miRNA expression and histological properties of hair follicles, highly significant differences in miRNA-143 expression levels between large and small waves were observed (P < 0. 01), and significant differences in the miRNA-10a expression levels between large and small waves (P < 0. 05) and in let-7i expression levels between large and medium waves were observed (P < 0. 05).

Festa et al, in 2011, reported that adipocyte lineage cells support the stem cell niche and help drive the complex hair growth cycle. Adipose-derived regenerative cells (also known as stromal vascular fraction [SVF]) is a heterogeneous group of noncultured cells that can be reliably extracted from adipose by using automated systems, and these cells work largely by paracrine mechanisms to support adipocyte viability. While, today, autologous fat is transplanted primarily for esthetic and reconstructive volume, surgeons have previously reported positive skin and hair changes posttransplantation. This follicular regenerative approach is intriguing and raises the possibility that one can drive or restore the hair cycle in male and female pattern baldness by stimulating the niche with autologous fat enriched with SVF. In this first of a kind patient series, the authors report on the safety, tolerability, and quantitative, as well as photographic changes, in a group of patients with early genetic alopecia treated with subcutaneous scalp injection of enriched adipose tissue. The findings suggest that scalp stem cell-enriched fat grafting may represent a promising alternative approach to treating baldness in men and women.",

Unwanted facial and body hair presents as a common finding in many patients, such as females with hirsutism. With advances in laser and light technology, a clinically significant reduction in hair can be achieved in patients with light skin. However, in patients with darker skin, Fitzpatrick skin types (FST) IV-VI, the higher melanin content of the skin interferes with the proposed mechanism of laser-induced selective photothermolysis, which is to target the melanin in the hair follicle to cause permanent destruction of hair bulge stem cells. Many prospective and retrospective studies have been conducted with laser and light hair-removal devices, but most exclude patients with darkly pigmented skin, considering them a high-risk group for unwanted side effects, including pigmentation changes, blisters, and crust formation. We reviewed the published literature to obtain studies that focused on hair reduction for darker skin types. The existing literature for this patient population identifies longer wavelengths as a key element of the treatment protocol and indicates neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG), diode, alexandrite, and ruby lasers as well as certain intense pulsed light sources for safe hair reduction with minimal side effects in patients with FST IV-VI, so long as energy settings and wavelengths are appropriate. Based on the findings in this review, safe and effective hair reduction for patients with FST IV-VI is achievable under proper treatment protocols and energy settings.",

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of 6-Gingerol on hair growth. Mice were randomly divided into five groups ; after hair depilation (day 0), mice were treated with saline, or different concentrations of 6-Gingerol for 11 days. The histomorphological characteristics of the growing hair follicles were examined after hematoxylin and eosin staining. The results indicated that 6-Gingerol significantly suppressed hair growth compared with that in the control group. And choose the concentration of 6-Gingerol at 1 mg/mL to treated with mice. Moreover, 6-Gingerol (1 mg/mL) significantly reduced hair re-growth ratio, hair follicle number, and hair follicle length, which were associated with increased expression of MMP2 and MMP9. Furthermore, the growth factors, such as EGF, KGF, VEGF, IGF-1 and TGF-beta participate in the hair follicle cycle regulation and regulate hair growth. We then measured the concentrations of them using ELISA assays, and the results showed that 6-Gingerol decreased EGF, KGF, VEGF, and IGF-1 concentrations, and increased TGF-beta concentration. Thus, this study showed that 6-Gingerol might act as a hair growth suppressive drug via induction of MMP2 and MMP9 expression, which could interfere with the hair cycle.",

Cellular plasticity for fate acquisition is associated with distinct chromatin states, which include histone modifications, dynamic association of chromatin factors with the DNA, and global chromatin compaction and nuclear organization. While embryonic stem cell (ESC) plasticity in vitro and its link with chromatin states have been characterized in depth, little is known about tissue stem cell plasticity in vivo, during adult tissue homeostasis. Recently, we reported a distinct globally low level of histone H3 K4/9/27me3 in mouse hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) during quiescence. This occurred at the stage preceding fate acquisition, when HFSC fate plasticity must be at its highest. This hypomethylated state was required for proper skin homeostasis and timely hair cycle. Here, we show both in the live tissue and in cell culture that at quiescence HFSCs have higher exchange rates for core histone H2B when compared with proliferative or differentiated cells. This denoted a hyperdynamic chromatin state, which was previously associated with high cell fate plasticity in ESCs. Moreover, we find that quiescent HFSCs display a higher propensity for de-differentiation in response to Yamanaka ' s reprogramming factors in vivo. These results further support our recent model in which HFSCs render their chromatin into a specific state at quiescence, which is attuned to higher cell fate plasticity.",

    "text": "\" Naturally Occurring Hair Growth Peptide: Water-Soluble Chicken Egg Yolk Peptides Stimulate Hair Growth Through Induction of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Production. Alopecia is divided into two categories: androgenic alopecia and nonandrogenic alopecia. An androgen-dependent abnormality of biological functions causes alopecia in males, but the role of androgens is not yet elucidated in female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Modulation of androgenic activity is not effective in certain kinds of androgenic alopecia in females, as well as in cases of nonandrogenic alopecia in males and females. The hair growth drug, minoxidil, stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production as well as vascularization and hair growth in females. Yet, because minoxidil has side effects with long-term use, a safe alternative hair growth agent is needed. Whereas hair develops after birth in mammalian species, hair mostly grows in a precocial bird, in the chicken, between hatching days 14 and 15. Therefore, we hypothesized that the chicken egg contains a key hair growth factor. In this study, we demonstrated that water-soluble peptides derived from the egg yolk stimulate VEGF production and human hair follicle dermal papilla cell growth. We also found that these peptides enhance murine hair growth and improve hair growth in FPHL. Finally, we characterized that water-soluble egg yolk peptides induce VEGF expression through insulin growth factor-1 receptor activation-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha transcription pathway. We have given the name \" \" hair growth peptide (HGP) \" \" to this water-soluble egg yolk peptide. \"",

Interestingly, while SOX9 is critical for HFSC specification, it is dispensable for Merkel cell formation. Conversely, FGFR2 is required for Merkel cell formation but is dispensable for HFSCs.

OBJECTIVE: Hair greying (i. e., canities) is a component of chronological ageing and occurs regardless of gender or ethnicity. Canities is directly linked to the loss of melanin and increase in oxidative stress in the hair follicle and shaft. To promote hair pigmentation and reduce the hair greying process, an agonist of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), a biomimetic peptide (palmitoyl tetrapeptide-20 ; PTP20) was developed. The aim of this study was to describe the effects of the designed peptide on hair greying. METHODS: Effect of the PTP20 on the enzymatic activity of catalase and the production of H2 O2 by Human Follicle Dermal Papilla Cells (HFDPC) was evaluated. Influence of PTP20 on the expression of melanocortin receptor-1 (MC1-R) and the production of melanin were investigated. Enzymatic activity of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) after treatment with PTP20 was also determined. Ex vivo studies using human micro-dissected hairs allowed to visualize the effect of PTP20 on the expression in hair follicle of catalase, TRP-1, TRP-2, Melan-A, ASIP, and MC1-R. These investigations were completed by a clinical study on 15 human male volunteers suffering from premature canities. RESULTS: The in vitro and ex vivo studies revealed the capacity of the examined PTP20 peptide to enhance the expression of catalase and to decrease (30%) the intracellular level of H2 O2. Moreover, PTP20 was shown to activate in vitro and ex vivo the melanogenesis process. In fact, an increase in the production of melanin was shown to be correlated with elevated expression of MC1-R, TRP-1, and Melan-A, and with the reduction in ASIP expression. A modulation on TRP-2 was also observed. The pivotal role of MC1-R was confirmed on protein expression analysed on volunteer ' s plucked hairs after 3 months of the daily application of lotion containing 10 ppm of PTP20 peptide. CONCLUSION: The current findings demonstrate the ability of the biomimetic PTP20 peptide to preserve the function of follicular melanocytes. The present results suggest potential cosmetic application of this newly designed agonist of alpha-MSH to promote hair pigmentation and thus, reduce the hair greying process.",

BACKGROUND: Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, is known to increase the intracellular level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which causes vasodilation. However, the effect of sildenafil on human hair follicles (hHFs) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the role of sildenafil in hair growth. METHODS: We investigated the expression of PDE5 in human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and hHFs. The effects of sildenafil on hDPC proliferation were evaluated using BrdU assays. The mRNA expression of growth factors and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation were investigated using real-time PCR and western blotting, respectively. Additionally, anagen induction and perifollicular vessel formation were evaluated using an in vivo mice model. RESULTS: We confirmed high expression of PDE5 in hDPCs and hHFs. Sildenafil enhances proliferation of hDPCs and up-regulates the mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which are responsible for hair growth. Additionally, sildenafil up-regulates the levels of phosphorylated ERK and accelerates anagen induction by stimulating perifollicular vessel formation after topical application in mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three fundamental hair parameters in different scalp areas of 90 Southern Chinese FPHL patients and 83 healthy controls were analyzed by phototrichogram. RESULTS: Female pattern hair loss patients showed reduced hair density, hair diameter, and terminal/vellus hair ratio. The reduction correlated with the severity of Ludwig staging. Midscalp was the most affected area in FPHL, but occipital and temporal sites were also involved. In normal women, the highest hair density was observed in midscalp, followed by occipital and temporal areas. Peak hair density at midscalp sites was reached at 20s group, then declined with age. Maximum hair diameter at midscalp and occipital sites occurred in 40s group. Terminal/vellus hair ratio tended to increase with age and peak on 50-60s group. CONCLUSION: Reduced hair density and hair diameter, and miniaturization of hair follicles are the characteristics of FPHL in Southern Chinese women.

The expression signature of key genes controlling hair growth and cycling, apoptosis, inflammation, and senescence was assessed for (1) chilled versus room temperature (RT) and (2) DP cell medium, saline, Hypothermosol, platelet-rich plasma, and ATPv-supplemented saline. RESULTS: The authors found chilled versus RT to prevent inflammatory cytokine signaling. Under chilled conditions, ATPv-supplemented saline was the best condition to preserve the expression of the trichogenic genes HEY1 and LEF1. CONCLUSION: Data disclose DP gene expression analysis as a useful methodology to ascertain the efficacy of preserving solutions and elucidate about the best currently available option for FUE clinical practice.",

    "text": "Dose-response of human follicles during laser-based hair removal: Ex vivo photoepilation model with classification system embracing morphological and histological features. OBJECTIVES: Photoepilation is a commonly used technology in home-use devices (HUDs) and in professional systems to remove unwanted body hair using pulses of laser or intense pulsed light (IPL). Albeit HUDs and professional systems operate at different fluences and treatment regimes, both demonstrate high hair reduction. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unknown partly due to high divergence of the existing literature data. The objective of this study was to develop an ex vivo photoepilation model with a set of criteria evaluating response to light pulses ; and to investigate dose-response behavior of hair follicles (HFs) subjected to a range of fluences. METHODS: After ex vivo treatment (single pulse, 810 nm, 1. 7-26. 4 J/cm2, 4-64 ms pulse) human anagen HFs were isolated and maintained in culture for 7-10 days. Response to light was evaluated based on gross-morphology and histological examination (H & E and TUNEL stainings). RESULTS: HFs treated ex vivo demonstrated a dose-dependent response to light with five distinct classes defined by macroscopic and microscopic criteria. Fluences below 13. 2 J/cm2 provoked catagen-like transition, higher fluences resulted in coagulation in HF compartments. CONCLUSION: Observed changes in the HF organ culture model were reflected by clinical efficacy. The developed photoepilation model provides an easy and fast method to predict clinical efficacy and permanency of light-based hair removal devices. Lasers Surg. Med. 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "text": "Comparative Analysis of Biological Properties of Large-Scale Expanded Adult Neural Crest-Derived Stem Cells Isolated from Human Hair Follicle and Skin Dermis. Introduction: The adult neural crest-derived stem cells (NCSCs) have significant perspectives for use in regenerative medicine. The most attractive sources for adult NCSC isolation are the hair follicles (HF) and skin dermis (SD) because of easy access and minimally invasive biopsy. The aim of this study was to compare the biological properties of HF-and SD-derived NCSCs after their large-scale expansion. Methods: The conventional explant method was used to obtain HF NCSCs. For the isolation of SD NCSCs, a new combined technique consisting of preplating and subsequent culturing in 3D blood plasma-derived fibrin hydrogel was applied. The studied cells were characterized by flow cytometry, ICC, qPCR, Bio-Plex multiplex assay, and directed multilineage differentiation assays. Results: We have obtained both adult SD and HF NCSCs from each skin sample (n = 5). Adult SD and HF NCSCs were positive for key neural crest markers: SOX10, P75 (CD271), NESTIN, SOX2, and CD349. SD NCSCs showed a higher growth rate during the large-scale expansion compared to HF NCSCs (p < 0. 01). Final population of SD NCSCs also contained more clonogenic cells (p < 0. 01) and SOX10 +, CD271 +, CD105 +, CD140a +, CD146 +, CD349 + cells (p < 0. 01). Both HF and SD NCSCs had similar gene expression profiling and produced growth factors, but some quantitative differences were detected. Adult HF and SD NCSCs were able to undergo directed differentiation into neurons, Schwann cells, adipocytes, and osteoblasts. Conclusion: The HF and SD are suitable sources for large-scale manufacturing of adult NCSCs with similar biological properties. We demonstrated that the NCSC population from SD was homogenous and displayed significantly higher growth rate than HF NCSCs. Moreover, SD NCSC isolation is cheaper, easier, and minimally time-consuming method.",

Dermal papillae (DP) play key roles in hair growth and regeneration by regulating follicular cell activity. Owing to the established roles of exosomes (Exos) in the regulation of cell functions, we investigated whether DP-derived Exos, especially those from three-dimensional (3D)-cultured DP cells, affect hair growth, cycling and regeneration. Exos derived from 3D DP (3D DP-Exos) promoted the proliferation of DP cells and outer root sheath (ORS) cells and increased the expression of growth factors (IGF-1, KGF and HGF) in DP cells. 3D DP-Exo treatment also increased hair shaft elongation in cultured human hair follicles. In addition, local injections of 3D DP-Exos induced anagen from telogen and also prolonged anagen in mice. Moreover, Exo treatment in human DP spheres augmented hair follicle neogenesis when the DP spheres were implanted with mouse epidermal cells. Similar results were obtained using Exos derived from 2D-cultured DP cells (2D DP-Exo). Collectively, our data strongly suggest that Exos derived from DP cells promote hair growth and hair regeneration by regulating the activity of follicular dermal and epidermal cells ; accordingly, these findings have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for hair loss.",

Alopecia is a clinical condition caused by excessive hair loss which may result in baldness, the causes of which still remain elusive. Conditioned media (CM) from stem cells shows promise in regenerative medicine. Our aim was to evaluate the potential CM of dental pulp stem cells obtained from human deciduous teeth (SHED-CM) to stimulate hair growth under in vitro and in vivo conditions. SHED and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) (n = 3) were cultured in media combinations ; i) STK2, ii) DMEM-KO + 10% FBS, iii) STK2 + 2% FBS and profiled for the presence of positive hair growth-regulatory paracrine factors ; SDF-1, HGF, VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and negative hair growth-regulatory paracrine factors ; IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TGF-beta, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and BDNF. The potential of CM from both cell sources to stimulate hair growth was evaluated based on the paracrine profile and measured dynamics of hair growth under in vitro conditions. The administration of CM media to telogen-staged synchronized 7-week old C3H/HeN female mice was carried out to study the potential of the CM to stimulate hair growth in vivo. SHED and HFSCs cultured in STK2 based media showed a shorter population doubling time, higher viability and better maintenance of MSC characteristics in comparison to cells cultured in DMEM-KO media. STK2 based CM contained only two negative hair growth-regulatory factors ; TNF-alpha, IL-1 while DMEM-KO CM contained all negative hair growth-regulatory factors. The in vitro study confirmed that treatment with STK2 based media CM from passage 3 SHED and HFSCs resulted in a significantly higher number of anagen-staged hair follicles (p < 0. 05) and a significantly lower number of telogen-staged hair follicles (p < 0. 05). Administration of SHED-CM to C3H/HeN mice resulted in a significantly faster stimulation of hair growth in comparison to HFSC-CM (p < 0. 05), while the duration taken for complete hair coverage was similar for both CM sources. Thus, SHED-CM carries the potential to stimulate hair growth which can be used as a treatment tool for alopecia.",

We measured the HF density on dorsal skin and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway protein expression level. Meanwhile, whole HFs were isolated from Rex rabbit skins and cultured with Met in vitro to measure hair shaft growth. The relationship between Met and the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway was also characterized by using the Wnt/beta-catenin signalling inhibitor, XAV-939. The results showed that the addition of dietary Met could significantly increase the HF density on dorsal skin (p <. 05) and enhance the protein expression level of Wnt10b (p <. 05), beta-catenin (p <. 05) and DSH (p <. 05). Methionine stimulation could also prolong the hair shafts growth in vitro (p <. 05). And inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signalling using XAV-939 could eliminate this phenomenon.

    "text": "The Danger of Being Too Sympathetic: Norepinephrine in Alzheimer ' s Disease and Graying of Hair. Although alterations in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) with age have been reported, and serious degenerative diseases of the autonomic nervous system such as multiple system atrophy are more likely to strike older people, connections between dysregulated adrenergic receptors and age-associated diseases and phenotypes have not been well studied. Two recent reports suggest that SNS may be more closely connected than previously appreciated. First, low nanomolar concentrations of Alzheimer ' s disease (AD)-associated Abeta42-amyloid oligomers alter signaling by SNS neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) to sufficiently activate kinase GSK3beta to hyperphosphorylate tau, a key mediator of neurotoxicity in AD. Connecting beta-amyloid to tau in AD has been a key quest in understanding AD and developing therapeutics. The alpha2 adrenergic receptor inhibitory drug idazoxan reduces GSK3beta activity and tau phosphorylation in AD mice with improved cognitive function, even in the presence of beta-amyloid deposits. In this study, SNS activation in the brain coupled with problematic Abeta42-amyloid oligomers result in serious consequences that can be ameliorated by reducing SNS signaling. A second example of the detrimental effects of increased SNS signaling is the premature graying of hair in response to stress. Secretion of NE resulting from stress causes differentiation of most hair pigment melanocyte stem cells (MeSCs) into melanocytes, rapidly depleting the hair follicle of pigment-producing cells as mature melanocytes undergo apoptosis and MeSCs are eventually eliminated. Blockade of NE SNS signaling preserves hair coloration in stressed animals. Increased SNS activation has serious apparently irreversible effects on homeostasis in both situations. Although neither report directly addresses aging, given that AD and the loss of hair pigmentation have strong age associations, it is of interest to better understand the role that SNS has in promoting age-associated phenotypes generally and determine if tuning the SNS through drug-mediated attenuation of SNS signaling may be of medical benefit.",

Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is one of the most difficult adverse events of cancer treatment for patients. However, it is still unknown why anticancer drugs cause hair loss. We aimed to clarify the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced alopecia in mice using an in vivo imaging technique with a two-photon microscope, which enables observation of the deep reaction in the living body in real time. In this study, ICR mice were injected intraperitoneally with cyclophosphamide (120 microg/g). Changes in the hair bulb morphology, subcutaneous vessel permeability, and vessel density were evaluated by two-photon microscopy and conventional methods. In order to determine whether there is a causal relationship between vascular permeability and hair loss, we combined cyclophosphamide (50 microg/g) with subcutaneous histamine. Using two-photon microscopy and conventional examination, we confirmed that the hair bulbs became smaller, blood vessels around the hair follicle decreased, and vascular permeability increased at 24 hours after cyclophosphamide injection [corrected]. Apoptosis occurred in vascular endothelial cells around the hair follicle. Additionally, hair loss was exacerbated by temporarily enhancing vascular permeability with histamine. In conclusion, cyclophosphamide caused a decrease in vascular density and an increase in vascular permeability, therefore increased vascular permeability might be one of the causes of chemotherapy-induced alopecia.",

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Prunus mira Koehne (P. mira, Tibetan name:) is a kind of medicinal plant commonly used in Tibetan areas. The classic Tibetan medicine book Jingzhu Materia Medica records that \" \" the nut oil from P. mira is used to cure loss of hair, eyebrows, beards, etc. \" \" but the clinical experience has not been explored. Hair loss (alopecia) is a skin disease that becomes a common concern in Chinese society since it affects the appearance of a person. This paper studies the effectiveness of nut oil from P. mira in promoting hair growth and its working mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The content of different components in the nut oil from P. mira was determined by HPLC. Two hair removal methods (sodium sulfide and hair removal cream) were used to study the effect of different doses on hair growth in KM mice. Then select the effective group, and use C57BL/6 mice to determine the number of hair follicles, dermal thickness, beta-catenin, GSK3beta and Wnt10 b mRNA and protein expression. RESULTS: The contents of alpha-tocopherol, beta-sitosterol, Vitamin E, Oleic acid and linoleic acid in nut oil from P. mira growing in 12 different regions were determined by HPLC. The linearity reached 0. 999. The RSD of precision, stability, repeatability, and sample recovery was less than 3%. The dose-effect relationship suggested that 30. 13 and 14. 07 mg medicinal material (cm2 d)-1 oil promoted hair growth and the dose effect was positively correlated. 30. 13 mg medicinal material (cm2 d)-1 nut oil from P. mira can accelerate hair follicles into the anagen, increasing Wnt 10 b mRNA expression, beta-catenin mRNA and protein expression, and GSK-3 beta protein expression. CONCLUSION: This study improved the quality control of nut oil from P. mira and found that it has the effect of promoting hair growth in mice. The working mechanism may be related to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. \"",

The diameter of the DP is directly proportional to the width of the hair shaft, and a decrease in both cell number and DP size is observed in hair loss conditions such as androgenetic alopecia. Conversely, microdissected ex vivo DP can instruct growth of de novo hair follicles.

Alopecia is resulted from various factors that can decrease the regeneration capability of hair follicles and affect hair cycles. This process can be devastating physically and psychologically.

According to the possible pathogenesis of nonscarring alopecia, especially androgenetic alopecia, recovering or replenishing the signals responsible for hair follicle stem cells activation is a promising strategy for hair regeneration. Recently, stem cell-based therapies, especially those based on the stem cell-derived conditioned medium (CM), which is secreted by stem cells and is rich in paracrine factors, have been widely explored as the hair regenerative medicine. Several studies have focused on altering the composition and up-regulating the amount of secretome of the stem cells, thereby enhancing its therapeutic effects. Besides, stem cell-derived exosomes, which are present in the CM as message entities, are also promising for hair regrowth.

Tissue growth in the adult is an orchestrated process that often requires biological clocks to time stem cell and progenitor activity. Here, we employed the hair follicle, which cycles between growth and regression in a timely-restricted mode, to show that some components of the hair cycle clock reside within the mesenchymal niche of the hair follicle, the dermal papilla (DP), and both Fgf and Wnt signaling pathways interact within the DP to regulate the expression of these components that include Wnt agonists (Rspondins) and antagonists (Dkk2 and Notum). The levels of Wnt agonists and antagonists in the DP are progressively reduced and elevated during the growth phase, respectively. Consequently, Wnt signaling activity in the overlying epithelial progenitor cells decreases, resulting in the induction of the regression phase. Remarkably, DP properties allow Wnt activity in the DP to persist despite the Wnt-inhibiting milieu and consequently synchronize the induction and progression of the regression phase. This study provides insight into the importance of signaling crosstalk in coupling progenitors and their niche to regulate tissue growth.",

BACKGROUND: The association of molecular phenotypes, such as gene transcript levels, with human common genetic variation can help to improve our understanding of interindividual variability of tissue-specific gene regulation and its implications for disease. METHODS: With the aim to capture the spectrum of biological processes affected by regulatory common genetic variants (minor allele frequency > = 1%) in healthy hair follicles (HFs) from scalp tissue, we performed a genome-wide mapping of cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in plucked HFs, and applied these eQTLs to help further explain genomic findings for hair-related traits. RESULTS: We report 374 high-confidence eQTLs found in occipital scalp tissue, whose associated genes (eGenes) showed enrichments for metabolic, mitotic and immune processes, as well as responses to steroid hormones. We were able to replicate 68 of these associations in a smaller, independent dataset, in either frontal and/or occipital scalp tissue. Furthermore, we found three genomic regions overlapping reported genetic loci for hair shape and hair color. We found evidence to confirm the contributions of PADI3 to human variation in hair traits and suggest a novel potential candidate gene within known loci for androgenetic alopecia. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that an array of basic cellular functions relevant for hair growth are genetically regulated within the HF, and can be applied to aid the interpretation of interindividual variability on hair traits, as well as genetic findings for common hair disorders.",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of platelet-rich plasma on hair regrowth and lesional T-cell cytokine expression in alopecia areata. METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, split-head study involving 27 patients with alopecia areata (Severity of Alopecia Tool score > = 25%). Alopecia patches on either side of the scalp were randomized to receive 3 intradermal injections of platelet-rich plasma or normal saline at monthly intervals and evaluated 3 months after the last session.

Stress is a risk factor for many skin conditions, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of its impacts have only begun to be revealed. In mice, acute stress induces loss of melanocyte stem cells (MeSCs) and premature hair greying. Our previous work demonstrated that the loss of MeSCs upon acute stress is caused by the hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. Stress also induces the secretion of stress hormones from the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ; however, whether stress hormones are involved in the hair greying process has not been fully examined. In particular, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is released from the pituitary glands upon stress. ACTH is a ligand for the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), which plays critical roles in regulating MeSC migration and skin pigmentation. We investigated whether the MC1R pathway is required for the stress-induced hair greying. We confirmed that MC1R is the major melanocortin receptor expressed in MeSCs. However, induction of acute stress via resiniferatoxin (RTX) injection still leads to hair greying in Mc1r mutant mice, suggesting that the ACTH-MC1R pathway is not a major contributor in acute stress-induced premature hair greying.",

Hair follicles (HFs) are immersed within dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT), yet human adipocyte-HF communication remains unexplored. Therefore, we investigated how perifollicular adipocytes affect the physiology of human anagen scalp HFs. Quantitative immunohistomorphometry, X-ray microcomputed tomography, and transmission electron microscopy showed that the number and size of perifollicular adipocytes declined during anagen-catagen transition, whereas fluorescence-lifetime imaging revealed increased lipid oxidation in adipocytes surrounding the bulge and/or sub-bulge region. Ex vivo, dWAT tendentially promoted hair shaft production, and significantly stimulated hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation and HF pigmentation. Both dWAT pericytes and PREF1/DLK1 + adipocyte progenitors secreted HGF during human HF-dWAT co-culture, for which the c-Met receptor was expressed in the hair matrix and dermal papilla. These effects were reproduced using recombinant HGF and abrogated by an HGF-neutralizing antibody. Laser-capture microdissection-based microarray analysis of the hair matrix showed that dWAT-derived HGF upregulated keratin (K) genes (K27, K73, K75, K84, K86) and TCHH. Mechanistically, HGF stimulated Wnt/beta-catenin activity in the human hair matrix (increased AXIN2, LEF1) by upregulating WNT6 and WNT10B, and inhibiting SFRP1 in the dermal papilla.

Hair loss, including alopecia, is a common and distressing problem for men and women, and as a result, there is considerable interest in developing treatments that can prevent or reverse hair loss. Dermal papillae closely interact with epidermal cells and play a key role during hair follicle induction and hair morphogenesis. As dermal papilla cells (DPCs) lose their hair-inducing ability in monolayer cultures in vitro, it is difficult to obtain de novo hair follicle structures following DPC transplantation in vivo. The present study aimed to explore culture conditions to maintain DPC characteristics using conditioned media (CM) from the supernatant of cultured HaCaT keratinocyte cells supplemented with other components. Initially, it was observed that during passaging of in vitro monolayer DPC cultures, the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was repressed, while the TGF-beta/Smad pathway was activated, and that HaCaT cells cultivated in 1% fetal bovine serum had higher levels of expression of Wnt3a and Wnt10b compared with normal keratinocytes. Culturing of high-passage (P7) DPCs in CM from HaCaT cells (HaCaT-CM) actively stimulated cell proliferation and maintained Sox2 and Versican expression levels. Supplementation of HaCaT-CM with SB431542 (SB, a TGF-beta receptor inhibitor), CHIR99021, (CHIR, a GSK3alpha/beta inhibitor and activator of Wnt signaling) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA further increased the expression levels of Sox2, Versican and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in P7 DPCs. Three-dimensional culture of P7 DPCs using hanging drop cultures in HaCaT-CM supplemented with SB, CHIR and PDGF-AA resulted in larger cell aggregates and a further significant upregulation of Sox2, ALP and Versican expression levels. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that HaCaT-CM supplemented with SB, CHIR and PDGF-AA may preserve the hair-inducing ability of high-passage DPCs and may therefore be useful in reconstructing new hair follicles in vivo.",

    "text": "Long hair follicular unit excision: personal experience. BACKGROUND: Long hair follicular unit excision (FUE) is the most state-of-the-art surgical technique in the field of hair transplantation surgery. Long hair FUE reduces the signs of surgery by camouflaging the recipient area with long hair, and allows hair curl identification when placing grafts. In addition, donor area shaving can be omitted. METHODS: This article presents the surgical approach and methods of long hair FUE. Patients were categorized by sex, age, recipient site, purpose of the surgery, and history of previous hair transplantation. Medical charts and photographs were reviewed to obtain the transection rate and calculated density for each patient. RESULTS: Long hair FUE was applied to 134 patients (112 women and 22 men). Thirty-four patients received eyebrow hair transplantation, 73 underwent female hairline correction surgery, nine patients underwent sideburn reconstruction, two were treated for female pattern hair loss, and 19 were treated for male pattern baldness (MPB). Four of the patients with MPB also underwent eyebrow transplant surgery. Of the patients with MPB, 17 (89%) had Norwood type III baldness, and two (11%) had type IV hair loss. The mean number of grafts required was 292 for eyebrow transplantation, 1, 214 for female hairline correction, 251 for sideburn reconstruction, 1, 344 for female pattern hair loss, and 1, 567 for MPB. The mean follicle transection rate was 9. 2%, and the mean calculated number of follicles per graft achieved was 2. 23. CONCLUSION: This long hair FUE method introduced by the authors is an excellent surgical method when performed by surgeons with sufficient skill and expertise.",

UDP-GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase, a product of two separate genes (GNPTAB, GNPTG), is essential for the sorting and transportation of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. GNPTAB gene defects cause extracellular missorting of lysosomal enzymes resulting in lysosomal storage diseases, namely mucolipidosis type II and mucolipidosis type III alpha/beta, which is associated with hair discoloration. Yet, the physiological functions of GNPTAB in the control of hair follicle (HF) pigmentation remain unknown. To elucidate these, we have silenced GNPTAB in organ-cultured human HFs as a human ex vivo model for mucolipidosis type II. GNPTAB silencing profoundly inhibited intrafollicular melanin production, the correct sorting of melanosomes, tyrosinase activity, and HMB45 expression in the HF pigmentary unit and altered HF melanocyte morphology in situ. In isolated primary human HF melanocytes, GNPTAB knockdown significantly reduced melanogenesis, tyrosinase activity, and correct tyrosinase protein sorting as well as POMC expression and caused the expected lysosomal enzyme missorting in vitro. Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing an inserted missense mutation corresponding to that seen in human mucolipidosis type II and mucolipidosis type III alpha/beta showed significantly reduced HF pigmentation, thus corroborating the in vivo relevance of our ex vivo and in vitro findings in the human system. This identifies GNPTAB as a clinically important enzymatic control of human HF pigmentation, likely by directly controlling tyrosinase sorting and POMC transcription in HF melanocytes.",

    "text": "Suppression of FGF5 and FGF18 Expression by Cholesterol-Modified siRNAs Promotes Hair Growth in Mice. FGF5 and FGF18 are key factors in the regulation of the hair follicle cycle. FGF5 is overexpressed during the late anagen phase and serves as a crucial regulatory factor that promotes the anagen-to-catagen transition in the hair follicle cycle. FGF18, which is overexpressed during the telogen phase, mainly regulates the hair follicle cycle by maintaining the telogen phase and inhibiting the entry of hair follicles into the anagen phase. The inhibition of FGF5 may prolong the anagen phase, whereas the inhibition of FGF18 may promote the transition of the hair follicles from the telogen phase to the anagen phase. In the present study, we used siRNA to suppress FGF5 or FGF18 expression as a way to inhibit the activity of these genes. Using qPCR, we showed that FGF5-targeting siRNA modified by cholesterol was more effective than the same siRNA bound to a cell-penetrating peptide at suppressing the expression of FGF5 both in vitro and in vivo. We then investigated the effects of the cholesterol-modified siRNA targeting either FGF5 or FGF18 on the hair follicle cycle in a depilated area of the skin on the back of mice. The cholesterol-modified siRNA, delivered by intradermal injection, effectively regulated the hair follicle cycle by inhibiting the expression of FGF5 and FGF18. More specifically, intradermal injection of a cholesterol-modified FGF5-targeted siRNA effectively prolonged the anagen phase of the hair follicles, whereas intradermal injection of the cholesterol-modified FGF18-targeted siRNA led to the mobilization of telogen follicles to enter the anagen phase earlier. The inhibitory effect of the cholesterol-modified FGF18-targeted siRNA on FGF18 expression was also evaluated for a topically applied siRNA. Topical application of a cream containing the cholesterol-modified FGF18-targeted siRNA on a depilated area of the skin of the back of mice revealed comparable inhibition of FGF18 expression with that observed for the same siRNA delivered by intradermal injection. These findings suggested that alopecia could be prevented and hair regrowth could be restored either through the intradermal injection of cholesterol-modified siRNA targeting FGF5 or FGF18 or the topical application of FGF18 siRNA.",

    "text": "New Donor Excision Design for Better Hair Alignment in Hair Restoration Surgery. BACKGROUND: The linear scar and misalignment of hair follicles are disadvantages of the follicular unit transplantation (FUT) or strip technique. The most common misalignment is at the end of the strip. Although most surgeons try to match hair direction to achieve optimal hair alignment, their attempts are often unsuccessful. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess strip designs to improve hair alignment during hair transplantation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 157 patients who underwent hair transplantation with either the commonly used elliptical incision or our novel triangular flag-shaped designed incision on the donor strip tip. Two blind evaluators assessed the outcome of hair alignment using a 5-point visual analog scale. RESULTS: In total, 303 wounds on 157 patients were assessed. Overall, our triangular flag-shaped design (TFD) achieved better hair alignment than the common elliptical design (CED) (p = 0. 01). Patients with hair direction straight on the upper wound edge and hair direction inward on the lower wound edge showed improved outcomes with TFD, whereas patients with hair direction inward on both upper and lower wound edges showed better outcomes with CED. CONCLUSIONS: The TFD tip of donor strips achieved proper hair alignment for most hair transplant patients.

Korean maritime pine bark (Pinus thunbergii) has been used as an alternative medicine due to its beneficial properties, including anti-inflammatory effects. To date, the anti-inflammatory and hair growth-promoting effects of Pinus densiflora bark extract have remained elusive. Therefore, in the present study, Pinus thunbergii bark was extracted with pure water (100 C) and the extract was examined to determine its polyphenol and flavonoid content. C57BL/6 mice were used to assess the effects of the extract to promote hair growth. The extract (1, 2 and 4%) was topically applied onto shaved dorsal skin and hair growth was observed for 17 days. A significant increase in hair growth was observed with 2 and 4% extract. Based on this finding, the optimal dose of the extract for effective hair growth promotion was determined to be 2%. The mechanisms of hair growth promotion were investigated via immunohistochemical analysis of changes in inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in the hair follicles following treatment with 2% extract. The treatment reduced the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, which are pro-inflammatory cytokines, while it enhanced the levels of IL-4 and IL-13, which are anti-inflammatory cytokines, in the hair follicles. In addition, elevated insulin-like growth factor I and vascular epidermal growth factor were detected in hair follicles following treatment. Based on these findings, it was suggested that the extract of Pinus thunbergii bark may be utilized for hair loss prevention and/or hair growth promotion.",

To investigate the CGE on hair growth and to explore the mechanism that is involved in the acceleration of anagen induction, we investigated the effects of CGE studied on cell proliferation and molecular mechanism in human hair dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and keratinocytes (HaCaT cells). Additionally, hair growth evaluation was carried out following topical treatment of the dorsal skin of telogen C57BL/6 mice with CGE for 14 days. As result, CGE increased cell viability and ALP activity in hDPCs. Moreover, CGE increased the expression of catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1), ALP, sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) genes in hDPCs. CGE increased the expression of proteins such as ALP, beta-catenin, and phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (pGSK3beta), and protein kinase B (pAKT) in hDPCs. Furthermore, CGE induced the proliferation of HaCaT cells and up-regulated AKT-ERK-GSKbeta-beta-catenin signaling in HaCaT cells. Additionally, the anagen induction effects of CGE were confirmed on the telogen-anagen transition mice model. these findings demonstrated that CGE promoted the entering the growth phase of hair follicle via activation of beta-catenin signaling pathways in vivo. Thus, this study suggests that CGE might be a potential therapeutic reagent for hair growth.",

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Microsurgical autologous hair transplantation, when performed as follicular unit transplantation, may permanently and naturally improve advanced androgenetic alopecia in men and women and also non-active scarring alopecias. MATERIALS, METHODS AND RESULTS: Sufficient donor hair and realistic patient expectations as well as an individual surgical planning of the hair distribution are crucial prerequisites for a sustainable hair restoration. They should be determined and evaluated during a personal pre-examination and consultation with the hair surgeon. Natural results can be achieved by transplanting up to several thousands of follicular units with high densities into small micro-slits. This technique also allows for increasing the hair density without injuring surrounding original pre-existing hairs. In progressive, early or advanced androgenetic alopecia, additional medical therapy is highly recommended to stabilize the condition. Otherwise, depending on supply and demand of donor hair, only a partial hair restoration can be achieved with a satisfying density. CONCLUSIONS: Since hair transplantation requires a precise sequence of surgical steps and careful handling of the tiny grafts, the skills and experience of the hair surgeon and his or her team are crucial. The medical risks of an assembly-line way of performing this surgery by non-licensed, non-physician staff, as reported from national clinics and medical tourism, should not be underestimated.

Human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) located in hair follicles (HFs) play a pivotal role in hair follicle morphogenesis, hair cycling, and hair growth. Over the past few decades, probiotic bacteria (PB) have been reported to have beneficial effects such as improved skin health, anti-obesity, and immuno-modulation for conditions including atopic dermatitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PB can secrete 50 ~ 150 nm sized extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing microbial DNA, miRNA, proteins, lipids, and cell wall components. These EVs can regulate communication between bacteria or between bacteria and their host. Although numerous biological effects of PB-EVs have been reported, the physiological roles of Leuconostoc holzapfelii (hs-Lh), which is isolated from human scalp tissue, and the extracellular vesicles derived from them (hs-LhEVs) are largely unknown. Herein, we investigated the effects of hs-LhEVs on hair growth in HFDPCs. We show that hs-LhEVs increase cell proliferation, migration, and regulate the cell cycle. Furthermore, hs-LhEVs were found to modulate the mRNA expression of hair-growth-related genes in vitro. These data demonstrate that hs-LhEVs can reduce apoptosis by modulating the cell cycle and promote hair growth by regulation via the Wnt/beta-catenin signal transduction pathway.",

The forkhead transcription factor FOXE1 is mutated in patients with Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome that exhibit hair follicle defects, suggesting a possible role for Foxe1 in hair follicle morphogenesis. Here, we report that Foxe1 is specifically expressed in the lower undifferentiated compartment of the hair follicle, at a time and site that parallel activation of the Shh signaling pathway. The Foxe1 protein is also expressed in human and mouse basal cell carcinoma in which hedgehog signaling is constitutively activated, whereas it is undetectable in normal epidermis and squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of Gli2 in skin results in complete suppression of Foxe1 expression in the hair follicle, whereas transcriptionally active Gli2 stimulates activity of the Foxe1 promoter. Foxe1-null skin displays aberrant hair formation with the production of thinner and curly pelage hairs. Although the hair follicle internal structure is conserved and several lineage markers are properly expressed, the orderly downgrowth of follicles is strikingly disrupted, causing disorientation, misalignment and aberrantly shaped of hair follicles. Our findings provide a strong indication that the defect in Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome is due to altered FOXE1 function in the hair follicle, and is independent of systemic defects present in affected individuals. In addition, we establish Foxe1 as a downstream target of the Shh/Gli pathway in hair follicle morphogenesis, and as a crucial player for correct hair follicle orientation into the dermis and subcutis.",

    "text": "A review: the location, molecular characterisation and multipotency of hair follicle epidermal stem cells. INTRODUCTION: Recent work has focused on the hair follicle as the main repository of multipotent stem cells in skin, which is a neat model to study the mechanisms regulating the proliferation, migration and final fate of adult stem cells. This review examines the available literature for its location, molecular markers and multipotency. METHODS: Peer-reviewed journals and monographs on the subject were covered. RESULTS: With the application of stem cell-labelling techniques and clonogenicity assay, it is clear that most of the hair follicle stem cells are located at the bulge region, but the base of the hair follicle does contain some clonogenic cells ; whether they are stem cells is still unknown. Extensive works have been done in identifying hair follicle stem cells. The potential markers for hair follicle stem cells include: b1-integrin, keratin 19, a6-integrin, CD71, p63, and CD34. Most of these markers are expressed in high levels in hair follicle stem cells, but there is still difficulty in distinguishing hair follicle stem cells from their transitamplifying progeny, and the sorted hair follicle stem cells with these markers are far from pure. As hair follicle stem cells might have been activated after leaving the stem cell niche, the markers for cells in vitro might not be identical to those in vivo. Using double-labelling techniques with BrdU and 3H-Thymidine, and the creation of novel chimera transgenic mice, it was proved that hair follicle stem cells can repopulate wound epidermis, forming epidermis, hair follicles and sebaceous glands, but it contributes little to the epidermis in physiological condition, except the hair follicle. CONCLUSIONS: Slow cycling, label-retaining cells exist at the bulge of the hair follicle, with high proliferative potential and clonogenicity. The putative bulge stem cells can contribute to the epidermis, outer root sheath, inner root sheath, hair shaft and sebaceous gland. However, they still lack certain markers to distinguish bulge stem cells from their progeny, and much work needs to focus on the interrelations between bulge cells and interfollicular keratinocyte stem cells, the relations between bulge cells and dermal papilla mesenchyme cells, and the mechanism of hair growth.",

Hair follicle morphogenesis depends on a delicate balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, which involves epithelium-mesenchyme interactions. We show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta) and Akt1 are highly expressed in follicular keratinocytes throughout hair follicle development. Interestingly, PPARbeta/delta-and Akt1-deficient mice exhibit similar retardation of postnatal hair follicle morphogenesis, particularly at the hair peg stage, revealing a new important function for both factors in the growth of early hair follicles. We demonstrate that a time-regulated activation of the PPARbeta/delta protein in follicular keratinocytes involves the up-regulation of the cyclooxygenase 2 enzyme by a mesenchymal paracrine factor, the hepatocyte growth factor. Subsequent PPARbeta/delta-mediated temporal activation of the antiapoptotic Akt1 pathway in vivo protects keratinocytes from hair pegs against apoptosis, which is required for normal hair follicle development. Together, these results demonstrate that epithelium-mesenchyme interactions in the skin regulate the activity of PPARbeta/delta during hair follicle development via the control of ligand production and provide important new insights into the molecular biology of hair growth.",

Using navigated laser capture microdissection, bulge cells and outer root sheath cells from other follicle regions were obtained and analyzed with cDNA microarrays.

Human skin is a local source of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and expresses CRH and CRH receptors (CRH-R) at mRNA and protein levels. Epidermal melanocytes respond to CRH by induction of cAMP with up-regulation of pro-opiomelanocortin gene expression and subsequent production of adrenocorticotropin hormone. However, the role of CRH/CRH-R in melanocyte biology is complicated by the significant heterogeneity of cutaneous melanocyte subpopulations, from continuously active and UV-responsive melanocytes in epidermis to UV nonresponsive, hair growth cycle-coupled melanogenesis in hair follicles. In the present study we report that normal human scalp hair follicle melanocytes express CRH at the mRNA level. Furthermore, CRH, urocortin and CRH-R 1 and 2 were differentially expressed in follicular melanocytes, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes depending on anatomic location and differentiation status in situ and in vitro. Stimulation of follicular melanocytes with CRH and CRH peptides, modified for selectivity for CRH-R1 and/or CRH-R2, variably induced cell melanogenesis, dendricity, and proliferation. CRH-peptides also stimulated the expression and activity of Tyrosinase, and expression of Tyrosinase-related protein-1 and-2. However, a modified urocortin peptide highly selective for CRH-R2 down-regulated melanocyte differentiation phenotype.

Epithelial stem cells (EP-SCs) located in the bulge region of a hair follicle (HF) have the potential to give rise to hair follicle stem/progenitor cells that migrate down to regenerate HFs. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling has been shown to regulate the HF cycle by inhibiting anagen induction. Here we show that active BMP signaling functions to prevent EP-SC activation and expansion. Dynamic expression of Noggin, a BMP antagonist, releases EP-SCs from BMP-mediated restriction, leading to EP-SC activation and initiation of the anagen phase. Experimentally induced conditional inactivation of the BMP type IA receptor (Bmpr1a) in EP-SCs leads to overproduction of HF stem/progenitor cells and the eventual formation of matricomas. This genetic manipulation of the BMP signaling pathway also reveals unexpected activation of beta-catenin, a major mediator of Wnt signaling. We propose that BMP activity controls the HF cycle by antagonizing Wnt/beta-catenin activity. This is at least partially achieved by BMP-mediated enhancement of transforming growth factor-beta-regulated epithelial cell-specific phosphatase (PTEN) function. Subsequently, PTEN, through phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase-Akt, inhibits the activity of beta-catenin, the convergence point of the BMP and Wnt signaling pathways.",

However, most of those studies were performed in mouse hair follicles and our understanding of human bulge cells has been limited. Recently, remarkable progress was made in human bulge cell biology.

Laser capture microdissection enabled accurate isolation of human bulge cells and control cell populations. Microarray comparison analyses between isolated bulge and nonbulge cells elucidated the molecular signature of human bulge cells and identified cell surface markers for living bulge cell isolation.

Despite that glucocorticoids (GCs), acting through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) exert a pivotal role in skin physiopathology, specific genes regulated by GR in this tissue are largely unknown. We have used a transgenic mouse model overexpressing GR in epidermal basal cells and outer root sheath (ORS) of the hair follicle (HF) under the control of the keratin 5 regulatory sequences (K5-GR mice) to identify GR-regulated genes in mouse skin. We analyzed the transcriptomic profile of adult K5-GR skin as compared to non-transgenic adult mice by using oligonucleotide microarrays and identified 173 genes differentially regulated by GR in this tissue. Our data were further validated by semiquantitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. We have identified a large subset of hair keratin intermediate filament (krt) and hair keratin-associated protein (krtap) genes, as well as several hox genes as GC-regulated. Since dysregulation of krt, krtaps and hox genes can cause hair disorders, as it occurs in adult K5-GR mice, our findings strongly suggest a role of GR in HF morphogenesis through the coordinated regulation of these hair-specific genes. In addition, we found that GR repressed several genes related to cell growth, such as the immediate early genes fosb and c-fos, according to the antiproliferative role described for this hormone receptor. By using cultured keratinocytes treated with GR-agonists and-antagonists, we demonstrated that down-regulation of fosb is mediated by GR. Identification of novel GR-regulated genes will help us to better understand the role of GCs as physiological modulators and pharmacological agents.",

Organ homeostasis and organismal survival are related to the ability of stem cells to sustain tissue regeneration. As a consequence of accelerated telomerase shortening, telomerase-deficient mice show defective tissue regeneration and premature death. This suggests a direct impact of telomere length and telomerase activity on stem cell biology. We recently found that short telomeres impair the ability of epidermal stem cells to mobilize out of the hair follicle (HF) niche, resulting in impaired skin and hair growth and in the suppression of epidermal stem cell proliferative capacity in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that telomerase reintroduction in mice with critically short telomeres is sufficient to correct epidermal HF stem cell defects. Additionally, telomerase reintroduction into these mice results in a normal life span by preventing degenerative pathologies in the absence of increased tumorigenesis.",

It is uncommon for hair loss to be the sole or predominant manifestation, as hair loss is the chief clinical and histologic differential diagnosis of alopecia areata. The main difference between these two entities is the detection of Treponema pallidum in syphilis. We present the case of a 24-year-old Hispanic man, human immunodeficiency virus seropositive in treatment, with tiny patches of non-cicatricial alopecia in the parieto-occipital regions of his scalp. The patient denied previous history of genital or other skin lesions. A biopsy from an alopecic patch was performed which showed an inflammatory non-scarring alopecia with a discrete lymphocytic type inflammatory infiltrate localized in the peribulbar region. There was lymphocyte exocytosis into the matrix, associated with vacuolar degeneration, and scattered apoptotic cells were observed. Plasma cells were scattered. Immunohistochemical studies showed the presence of T. pallidum limited to the peribulbar region and penetrating into the follicle matrix. To the authors ' knowledge, this is the first time that spirochetes have been shown in the hair follicle in alopecia syphilitica, suggesting that the spirochetes may be pathogenetic and responsible for the alopecia.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of fabricating tissue engineering skin with human hair follicle bulge cells (HFBCs) to repair full-thickness skin wound. METHODS: HFBCs and dermal papilla cells (DPCs) isolated from human fetal hair follicles by collagenase digestion were cultured, purified and passaged. PGA-collagen scaffolds as bioengineered dermis were randomly divided into A and B groups. The HFBCs and DPCs (1: 2) were seeded in scaffolds of group A and the equal amount of DPCs was seeded in scaffolds of group B as control. Then the keratinocyte sheets were seeded onto the surfaces of the scaffolds as bioengineered epidermis. The tissue engineering skins were then transplanted to repair the full-thickness wound on the back of nude mice. The wound healing process was observed and the plant histological changes of the transplanted engineered skin was observed with light microscope on 2, 4, 6 post-operation weeks (POW). RESULTS: The full-thickness defect of nude mice in A and B groups could be effectively repaired by bioengineered skins. On 2 POW, integral epidermal and dermal structures were observed in the wounds in A and B groups, with thin epithelial layer and basement membrane. On 4 POW, epithelial layer became thickening and rete pegs formation was observed in basement membrane in A group, but only thickening of epithelial layer was observed in B group. On 6 POW, rete pegs structure was seen to descend and hair-follicle-like structure was formed, while only thickened epithelial layer with flat basement membrane were formed in B group. CONCLUSION: From the composite skin engineered with PGA-collagen hybrid scaffolds and keratinocytes, HFBCs and DPCs could effectively repair the full-thickness skin defect of nude mice. The hair follicle stem cells participate in the process of anatomic repair of wound, and might be able to induce the repair of skin structure and function.",

Stress alters murine hair growth, depending on substance P-mediated neurogenic inflammation and nerve growth factor (NGF), a key modulator of hair growth termination (catagen induction). Whether this is of any relevance in human hair follicles (HFs) is completely unclear. Therefore, we have investigated the effects of substance P, the central cutaneous prototypic stress-associated neuropeptide, on normal, growing human scalp HFs in organ culture. We show that these prominently expressed substance P receptor (NK1) at the gene and protein level. Organ-cultured HFs responded to substance P by premature catagen development, down-regulation of NK1, and up-regulation of neutral endopeptidase (degrades substance P). This was accompanied by mast cell degranulation in the HF connective tissue sheath, indicating neurogenic inflammation. Substance P down-regulated immunoreactivity for the growth-promoting NGF receptor (TrkA), whereas it up-regulated NGF and its apoptosis-and catagen-promoting receptor (p75NTR). In addition, MHC class I and beta2-microglobulin immunoreactivity were up-regulated and detected ectopically, indicating collapse of the HF immune privilege. In conclusion, we present a simplistic, but instructive, organ culture assay to demonstrate sensitivity of the human HF to key skin stress mediators. The data obtained therewith allow one to sketch the first evidence-based biological explanation for how stress may trigger or aggravate telogen effluvium and alopecia areata.",

Hair follicle (HF) formation is initiated when epithelial stem cells receive cues from specialized mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP) cells. In culture, DP cells lose their HF-inducing properties, but during hair growth in vivo, they reside within the HF bulb and instruct surrounding epithelial progenitors to orchestrate the complex hair differentiation program. To gain insights into the molecular program that maintains DP cell fate, we previously purified DP cells and four neighboring populations and defined their cell-type-specific molecular signatures. Here, we exploit this information to show that the bulb microenvironment is rich in bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) that act on DP cells to maintain key signature features in vitro and hair-inducing activity in vivo. By employing a novel in vitro/in vivo hybrid knockout assay, we ablate BMP receptor 1a in purified DP cells. When DPs cannot receive BMP signals, they lose signature characteristics in vitro and fail to generate HFs when engrafted with epithelial stem cells in vivo. These results reveal that BMP signaling, in addition to its key role in epithelial stem cell maintenance and progenitor cell differentiation, is essential for DP cell function, and suggest that it is a critical feature of the complex epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk necessary to make hair.",

The development of ectodermal organs requires signalling by ectodysplasin (Eda), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member, its receptor Edar and downstream activation of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor. In humans, mutations in the Eda pathway components cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, a syndrome characterized by missing teeth, sparse hair and defects in sweat glands. It has been postulated that Eda acts redundantly with another TNF pathway to regulate ectodermal organogenesis. A potential candidate is Troy (or TNFRSF19 or Taj), a TNF receptor which is homologous with Edar in its ligand-binding domain, and is expressed in an overlapping pattern. We have characterized Troy null mice and crossed them with Eda-deficient mice. Single Troy mutants had no defects in ectodermal organs. Analysis of the double mutants revealed an essential role for Troy in hair follicle development. In mice, hair follicles develop in three different waves. Only primary hair follicles are missing in Eda single mutants, whereas the compound mutants lacked also the follicles of the second wave, as well as all hair follicles in the middle of crown leading to focal alopecia. Assessment of NF-kappaB activity with a transgenic reporter construct indicated that Eda is the main activator of NF-kappaB signalling in developing skin appendages and surprisingly that the functional overlap of Troy and Eda signalling pathways is mediated by NF-kappaB independent pathways.",

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is an important regulator of growth, survival, and differentiation in many tissues. It is produced in several isoforms that differ in their N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal extension peptide. The locally acting isoform of IGF-1 (mIGF-1) was previously shown to enhance the regeneration of both muscle and heart. In this study, we tested the therapeutic potential of mIGF-1 in the skin by generating a transgenic mouse model in which mIGF-1 expression is driven by the keratin 14 promoter. IGF-1 levels were unchanged in the sera of hemizygous K14/mIGF-1 transgenic animals whose growth was unaffected. A skin analysis of young animals revealed normal architecture and thickness as well as proper expression of differentiation and proliferation markers. No malignant tumors were formed. Normal homeostasis of the putative stem cell compartment was also maintained. Healing of full-thickness excisional wounds was accelerated because of increased proliferation and migration of keratinocytes, whereas inflammation, granulation tissue formation, and scarring were not obviously affected. In addition, mIGF-1 promoted late hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling. To our knowledge, this is the first work to characterize the simultaneous, stimulatory effect of IGF-1 delivery to keratinocytes on two types of regeneration processes within a single mouse model. Our analysis supports the use of mIGF-1 for skin and hair regeneration and describes a potential cell type-restricted action.",

    "text": "The alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone-related tripeptide K (D) PT stimulates human hair follicle pigmentation in situ under proinflammatory conditions. BACKGROUND: Alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is a well-tolerated immunomodulator with cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects that is known to stimulate melanogenesis and proliferation of follicular melanocytes. As human hair follicles (HFs) locally synthesize alpha-MSH, pharmacologically more easily handled alpha-MSH-related tripeptides, such as K (D) PT, may imitate this endogenous regulation, and may show a favourable side-effect profile on clinical use. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of the synthetic, alpha-MSH-related peptide K (D) PT [which is identical to interleukin (IL)-1beta (193-195)] on melanogenesis in human anagen HFs, under normal and proinflammatory growth conditions. METHODS: Normal human anagen VI scalp HFs were microdissected and organ cultured with different concentrations of K (D) PT with or without coadministration of a proinflammatory, catagen-inducing stimulus, interferon (INF)-gamma. Masson-Fontana histochemistry and NKI/beteb immunohistochemistry were employed to assess changes in the degree of human HF pigmentation and melanocyte dendricity. RESULTS: As confirmed by quantitative (immuno-) histomorphometry, compared with controls, K (D) PT alone did not affect human HF pigmentation in organ culture. However, in the presence of a strong, prototypic proinflammatory stimulus (IFN-gamma), K (D) PT significantly stimulated HF melanin content and melanocyte dendrite formation in situ. CONCLUSIONS: The IL-1beta-and alpha-MSH-related tripeptide, K (D) PT, displays interesting hair pigmentation-stimulatory activities under proinflammatory conditions. These might become exploitable for innovative antigreying strategies, notably in postinflammatory poliosis (regrowth of white hair, e. g. during recovery from alopecia areata), where no effective clinical therapy is yet available.",

Primary cicatricial or scarring alopecias (CA) are a group of inflammatory hair disorders of unknown pathogenesis characterized by the permanent destruction of the hair follicle. The current treatment options are ineffective in controlling disease progression largely because the molecular basis for CA is not understood. Microarray analysis of the lymphocytic CA, Lichen planopilaris (LPP), compared to normal scalp biopsies identified decreased expression of genes required for lipid metabolism and peroxisome biogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed progressive loss of peroxisomes, proinflammatory lipid accumulation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells followed by destruction of the pilosebaceous unit. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, a transcription factor that regulates these processes, is significantly decreased in LPP. Specific agonists of PPARgamma are effective in inducing peroxisomal and lipid metabolic gene expression in human keratinocytes. Finally, targeted deletion of PPARgamma in follicular stem cells in mice causes a skin and hair phenotype that emulates scarring alopecia. These studies suggest that PPARgamma is crucial for healthy pilosebaceous units and it is the loss of this function that triggers the pathogenesis of LPP. We propose that PPARgamma-targeted therapy may represent a new strategy in the treatment of these disorders.",

OBJECTIVE: To induce hair follicle regeneration in rat ear by microencapsulated dermal papillae (DP) cells. METHODS: Intact dermal papillae were obtained from human scalp follicles which were digested with collagenase I. The human hair DP cells were encapsulated with alginate-polylysine-alginate (APA) by a high-voltage electric field droplet generator. The diameters of the DP cell microcapsules were optimized by regulating the voltage, the distance between the needle head and the solution surface and the injection speed. Then DP cell microencapsulations were xenotransplanted into ears of 20 SD rats with a novel method. One rat was killed every week at the postoperative 2-12 weeks and the implantation sites were biopsied for histological observation. RESULTS: The DP cell microencapsulations were found in a group of round, smooth and transparent microcapsules under a phase-contrast microscope. The optimal combination of parameters to obtain 0. 4 mm DP cell microcapsules was voltage 7. 0 kV, injection speed 55 mm/h, and distance 10 mm. After 4-12 weeks, 18 of 20 DP cell microcapsule implantations had produced high-density hair. Histological observation indicated that both large follicles and sebaceous gland structures were formed in the rat ear within 3-12 weeks.

    "text": "The hair follicle melanocytes in vitiligo in relation to disease duration. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary disorder of skin and hair. Active melanocytes in hair follicles can be detected by DOPA and immunohistochemical staining, while amelanotic melanocytes can only be detected by the latter. None of the studies on hair melanocytes in vitiligo discussed the effect of disease duration on these melanocytes. Here, we study the presence of melanotic and amelanotic melanocytes in vitiligo hair follicles and statistically correlating their presence with the disease duration. METHODS: This study was conducted on 30 patients with vitiligo and 10 normal volunteers. Three biopsies were taken from each patient: two from black and white hairs from vitiliginous areas and the third from apparently normal skin of the same patients. Sections were stained by DOPA reaction and NKI/beteb then examined for the presence of melanocytes. The presence of melanocytes and the disease duration were correlated statistically using the t-test. RESULTS: Active melanocytes were detected in black hairs of 6. 7% of vitiligo patients and in 100% of apparently normal skin of the same patients and controls. On examining black hairs of the 28 vitiligo patients with negative DOPA reaction, 19 of them (67. 9%) showed positive NKI/beteb stain. Disease duration was inversely correlated with the melanocytes ' presence within hair follicles. Melanocytes were absent from 100% of white hairs. CONCLUSIONS: The melanotic melanocytes were the first target of the disease process followed by the amelanotic melanocytes. Since the disappearance of the latter was inversely correlated with the disease duration, early treatment in vitiligo is advised.",

Hairpoor mice (Hr (Hp)) were derived through N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis. These mice display sparse and short hair in the Hr (Hp)/+ heterozygous state and complete baldness in the Hr (Hp)/Hr (Hp) homozygous state. This phenotype was irreversible and was inherited in an autosomal semidominant manner. Hair follicles (HFs) of Hr (Hp)/+ mice underwent normal cycling and appeared normal, although smaller than those of the wild-type mice. In contrast, HFs of Hr (Hp)/Hr (Hp) mice became cyst-like structures by postnatal day (P) 21. The number and length of vibrissae decreased in a dose-dependent manner as the number of mutant alleles increased. A positional candidate gene approach was used to identify the gene responsible for the hairpoor phenotype. Genetic linkage analysis determined that the hairpoor locus is 2 cm from D14Mit34 on chromosome 14. Sequence analysis of the exons of the candidate gene hairless revealed a T-to-A transversion mutation at nucleotide position 403 (exon 2), presumably resulting in abolishment of an upstream open reading frame (uORF). In addition, we also found that the near-naked mouse (Hr (N)), a spontaneously arising mutant, harbors a A402G transition in its genome. Both mutations were in the uATG codon of the second uORF in the 5 ' UTR and corresponded to the mutations identified in Marie Unna Hereditary Hypotrichosis (MUHH) patients. In the present study we describe the phenotype, histological morphology, and molecular etiology of an animal model of MUHH, the hairpoor mouse.",

    "text": "Palmitoylation regulates epidermal homeostasis and hair follicle differentiation. Palmitoylation is a key post-translational modification mediated by a family of DHHC-containing palmitoyl acyl-transferases (PATs). Unlike other lipid modifications, palmitoylation is reversible and thus often regulates dynamic protein interactions. We find that the mouse hair loss mutant, depilated, (dep) is due to a single amino acid deletion in the PAT, Zdhhc21, resulting in protein mislocalization and loss of palmitoylation activity. We examined expression of Zdhhc21 protein in skin and find it restricted to specific hair lineages. Loss of Zdhhc21 function results in delayed hair shaft differentiation, at the site of expression of the gene, but also leads to hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and sebaceous glands, distant from the expression site. The specific delay in follicle differentiation is associated with attenuated anagen propagation and is reflected by decreased levels of Lef1, nuclear beta-catenin, and Foxn1 in hair shaft progenitors. In the thickened basal compartment of mutant IFE, phospho-ERK and cell proliferation are increased, suggesting increased signaling through EGFR or integrin-related receptors, with a parallel reduction in expression of the key differentiation factor Gata3. We show that the Src-family kinase, Fyn, involved in keratinocyte differentiation, is a direct palmitoylation target of Zdhhc21 and is mislocalized in mutant follicles. This study is the first to demonstrate a key role for palmitoylation in regulating developmental signals in mammalian tissue homeostasis.",

Hair follicles (HFs) maintain a peripheral, functional equivalent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, whose most proximal element is corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The mast cell (MC)-rich connective-tissue sheath (CTS) of mouse vibrissa HFs harbors MC precursors. Differentiation of these MC precursors into mature MCs can be induced by stem cell factor (SCF). We have investigated whether the MC progenitors of normal human scalp HF CTS respond to stimulation with CRH. Microdissected anagen HFs and full-thickness scalp skin were treated with CRH (10 (-7) M). CRH treatment induced the degranulation of CTS MCs, in addition to increasing the number of CTS MCs in full-thickness skin and HF organ cultures in situ. In the latter, cells with characteristic MC features emigrated from the CTS. CRH-receptor protein expression in the CTS was colocalized with Kit expression on some CTS MCs in situ. CRH treatment upregulated SCF mRNA and protein expression within the HF epithelium. In skin organ culture, CRH-induced degranulation of CTS MCs was abolished by anti-SCF antibody. We demonstrate that human skin is an extramedullary reservoir for MC precursors, and we have identified a regulatory loop between CRH and SCF signaling.

Skin hair follicles (HF) contain bulge stem cells (SC) that regenerate HFs during hair cycles, and repair skin epithelia following injury. As natural aging is associated with decreased skin repair capacity in humans, we have investigated the impact of age on human scalp HF bulge cell number and function. Here, we isolated human bulge cells, characterized as CD200 +/KRT15 +/KRT19 + cells of the HF, by dissection-combined CD200 selection in young and aged human skin. Targeted transcriptional profiling indicates that KRT15, KRT19, Dkk3, Dkk4, Tcf3, S100A4, Gas1, EGFR and CTGF/CCN2 are also preferentially expressed by human bulge cells, compared to differentiated HF keratinocytes (KC). Our results demonstrate that aging does not alter expression or localization of these HF SC markers. In addition, we could not detect significant differences in HF density or bulge cell number between young and aged human scalp skin. Interestingly, hedgehog (Hh) signaling is activated in human bulge cells in vivo, and down-regulated in differentiated HF KCs, both in young and aged skin. In addition, activation of Hh signaling by lentivirus-mediated overexpression of transcription factor Gli1 induces transcription of HF SC markers KRT15, KRT19, and Gas1, in cultured KCs. Together with previously reported knock-out mouse results, these data suggest a role for Hh signaling in maintaining bulge cell phenotype in young and aged human skin.",

HFSCs of rat whisker was isolated and cultured on PLLA and differentiated with 10 ng/mL NT-3. Biological features of cultured cells were evaluated with immunocytochemistry and flowcytometry methods by using CD34, nestin, and betaIII-tubulin markers. For cell viability and morphological assessment, MTT assay and SEM were performed. Our results showed that bulge stem cells of hair follicle can express CD34 and Nestin before differentiation. By using NT-3 during differentiation process, the cells showed positive reaction to betaIII-tubulin antibody. MTT results demonstrated that PLLA significantly increased cell viability.

However, the exogenous effect of IGF-1 on hair growth in wild-type mice has not been reported. In the present study, we examined whether IGF-1 was an important regulator of hair follicle growth in wide-type mice in vivo. DESIGN: C57BL/6 mice were injected with different concentrations of IGF-1 on dorsal skin. The treated tissues were analyzed by immunoassay methods for TGF-beta1 and BrdU. RESULTS: Local injection of IGF-1 increased hair follicle number and prolonged the growing phase during the transition from anagen to telogen. Meanwhile, immunology analyses revealed that IGF-1 also stimulated the proliferation of follicle cells in anagen of the matrix and down regulated TGF-beta1 expression in hair follicles. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that IGF-1 is an effective stimulator of hair follicle development in wide-type mice in vivo and may be a promising drug candidate for baldness therapy.",

The use of adipocyte lineage cells, including adipose-derived stem cells, has shown promise as a cell-based solution to regulate hair regeneration and may help in maintaining or increasing dermal papilla cells inducing hair ability. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the understanding of the cellular contribution and regulation of dermal papilla cells and summarize adipocyte lineage cells in hair regeneration.",

Adult mammalian epidermis contains multiple stem cell populations in which quiescent and more proliferative stem and progenitor populations coexist. However, the precise interrelation of these populations in homeostasis remains unclear. Here, we blocked the contribution of quiescent keratin 19 (K19)-expressing bulge stem cells to hair follicle formation through genetic ablation of the essential histone methyltransferase Setd8 that is required for the maintenance of adult skin. Deletion of Setd8 eliminated the contribution of bulge cells to hair follicle regeneration through inhibition of cell division and induction of cell death, but the growth and morphology of hair follicles were unaffected. Furthermore, ablation of Setd8 in the hair follicle bulge blocked the contribution of K19-postive stem cells to wounded epidermis, but the wound healing process was unaltered. Our data indicate that quiescent bulge stem cells are dispensable for hair follicle regeneration and epidermal injury in the short term and support the hypothesis that quiescent and cycling stem cell populations are equipotent.",

A representative phenotype of patients with tricho-rhino-phalangeal syndrome (TRPS) is sparse hair. To understand the developmental defects of these patient ' s hair follicles, we analyzed the development of hair follicles histologically and biochemically using Trps1 deficient (KO) mice. First, we compared the numbers of primary hair follicles in wild-type (WT) and KO embryos at different developmental stages. No differences were observed in the E14. 5 skins of WT and KO mice. However, at later time points, KO fetal skin failed to properly develop secondary hair follicles, and the number of secondary hair follicles present in E18. 5 KO skin was approximately half compared to that of WT skin. Sonic hedgehog expression was significantly decreased in E17. 5 KO skin, whereas no changes were observed in Eda/Edar expression in E14. 5 or E17. 5 skins. In addition, Noggin expression was significantly decreased in E14. 5 and E17. 5 KO skin compared to WT skin. In parallel with the suppression of Noggin expression, BMP signaling was promoted in the epidermal cells of KO skins compared to WT skins as determined by immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated Smad1/5/8. The reduced number of secondary hair follicles was restored in skin graft cultures treated with a Noggin and BMP inhibitor. Furthermore, decreased cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis in KO skin was rescued by Noggin treatment. Taken together, we conclude that hair follicle development in Trps1 KO embryos is impaired directly or indirectly by decreased Noggin expression.",

Hair and feathers are unique because (1) their stem cells are contained within a follicle structure, (2) they undergo cyclic regeneration repetitively throughout life, (3) regeneration occurs physiologically in healthy individuals and (4) regeneration is also induced in response to injury. Precise control of this cyclic regeneration process is essential for maintaining the homeostasis of living organisms. While stem cells are regulated by the intra-follicle-adjacent micro-environmental niche, this niche is also modulated dynamically by extra-follicular macro-environmental signals, allowing stem cells to adapt to a larger changing environment and physiological needs. Here we review several examples of macro-environments that communicate with the follicles: intradermal adipose tissue, innate immune system, sex hormones, aging, circadian rhythm and seasonal rhythms. Related diseases are also discussed. Unveiling the mechanisms of how stem cell niches are modulated provides clues for regenerative medicine. Given that stem cells are hard to manipulate, focusing translational therapeutic applications at the environments appears to be a more practical approach.",

We have previously studied mouse whisker follicles in Gelfoam histoculture to determine the role of nestin-expressing plutipotent stem cells, located within the follicle, in the growth of the follicular sensory nerve. Long-term Gelfoam whisker histoculture enabled hair follicle nestin-expressing stem cells to promote the extensive elongation of the whisker sensory nerve, which contained axon fibers. Transgenic mice in which the nestin promoter drives green fluorescent protein (ND-GFP) were used as the source of the whiskers allowing imaging of the nestin-expressing stem cells as they formed the follicular sensory nerve. In the present report, we show that Gelfoam-histocultured whisker follicles produced growing pigmented and unpigmented hair shafts. Hair-shaft length increased rapidly by day-4 and continued growing until at least day-12 after which the hair-shaft length was constant. By day-63 in histoculture, the number of ND-GFP hair follicle stem cells increased significantly and the follicles were intact. The present study shows that Gelfoam histoculture can support extensive hair-shaft growth as well as hair follicle sensory-nerve growth from isolated hair follicles which were maintained over very long periods of time.

BACKGROUND: A penta-peptide, Gly-Pro-Ile-Gly-Ser (GPIGS), promotes proliferation of mouse hair keratinocytes and accelerates hair growth in mice. AIM OF THIS STUDY: This study focused on the ability of the peptide to promote human hair growth. METHODS: We used a human hair keratinocyte proliferation assay and organ cultures of human hair follicle as in vitro systems. The lotions with and without the penta-peptide were administered to 22 Japanese men with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) for 4 months in a double-blind and randomized clinical study. RESULTS: The penta-peptide significantly stimulated the proliferation of human hair keratinocytes at a concentration of 2. 3 mum (P < 0. 01), and 5. 0 mum of this peptide had a marked effect on hair shaft elongation in the organ culture (P < 0. 05). The change in the proportion of thick hair (> = 60 mum) compared to baseline in patients that received the peptide was significantly higher than in the placebo (P = 0. 006). The change in the proportion of vellus hair (< 40 mum) was also significantly lower in the peptide group than in the placebo (P = 0. 029). The penta-peptide also significantly improved the appearance of baldness (P = 0. 020) when blinded reviewers graded photographs of the participants according to a standardized baldness scale. No adverse dermatological effects due to treatment were noted during this clinical study. CONCLUSIONS: This penta-peptide promotes proliferation of human hair keratinocytes and hair shaft elongation of human hair follicles, in vitro.

    "text": "Deletion of the epidermis derived laminin gamma1 chain leads to defects in the regulation of late hair morphogenesis. Laminins are the most abundant non-collagenous basement membrane (BM) components, composed of an alpha, beta and gamma chain. The laminin gamma1 chain, encoded by LAMC1, is the most abundant gamma chain. The main laminin isoforms in the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ) are laminin-332, laminin-511 and laminin-211, the latter being restricted to the lower part of hair follicles (HFs). Complete deletion of LAMC1 results in lethality around embryonic day 5. 5. To study the function of laminin gamma1 containing isoforms in skin development and maturation after birth, we generated mice lacking LAMC1 expression in basal keratinocytes (LAMC1EKO) using the keratin 14 (K14) Cre/loxP system. This deletion resulted in loss of keratinocyte derived laminin-511 and in deposition of fibroblast derived laminin-211 throughout the whole DEJ. The DEJ in areas between hemidesmosomes was thickened, whereas hemidesmosome morphology was normal. Most strikingly, LAMC1EKO mice showed delayed HF morphogenesis accompanied by reduced proliferation of hair matrix cells and impaired differentiation of hair shafts (HS). However, this deletion did not interfere with early HF development, since placode numbers and embryonic hair germ formation were not affected. Microarray analysis of skin revealed down regulation of mainly different hair keratins. This is due to reduced expression of transcription factors such as HoxC13, FoxN1, FoxQ1 and Msx2, known to regulate expression of hair keratins. While the role of laminin-511 in signaling during early hair germ formation and elongation phase has been described, we here demonstrate that epidermal laminin-511 is also a key regulator for later hair development and HS differentiation.",

The hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) contains a unique prominin-1/CD133-positive (CD133 +) cell subpopulation, which has been shown to possess hair follicle-inducing capability. By assaying for endogenous CD133 expression and performing lineage tracing using CD133-CreERT2 ; ZsGreen1 reporter mice, we find that CD133 is expressed in a subpopulation of DP cells during the growth phase of the murine hair cycle (anagen), but is absent at anagen onset. However, how CD133 + DP cells interact with keratinocytes to induce hair regenerative growth remains unclear. Wnt/beta-catenin has long been recognized as a major signaling pathway required for hair follicle morphogenesis, development, and regeneration. Nuclear Wnt/beta-catenin activity is observed in the DP during the hair growth phase. Here we show that induced expression of a stabilized form of beta-catenin in CD133 + DP cells significantly accelerates spontaneous and depilation-induced hair growth. However, hair follicle regression is not affected in these mutants. Further analysis indicates that CD133 + DP-expressed beta-catenin increases proliferation and differentiation of epithelial matrix keratinocytes. Upregulated Wnt/beta-catenin activity in CD133 + DP cells also increases the number of proliferating DP cells in each anagen follicle.

PURPOSE: This review evaluates the effects of gamma-rays on the regeneration of murine hair follicles in the natural hair cycle. A series of studies were performed to investigate this issue, in which the whole bodies of C57BL/10JHir mice in the 1st telogen phase of the hair cycle were irradiated with gamma-rays. RESULTS: The dermis of the irradiated skin showed a decrease in hair follicle density and induction of curved hair follicles along with the presence of white hairs and hypopigmented hair bulbs in the 2nd and 3rd anagen phases. An increased frequency of hypopigmented hair bulbs was still observed in the later hair cycle at postnatal day 200. There was no significant difference in the number of stem cells in the hair bulge region between control and irradiated skin. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the effects of gamma-rays on the pigmentation of murine hair follicles are persistently carried over to later hair cycles, although those on the number and structure of hair follicles appear to be hidden by the effects of aging. Our findings may be important for understanding the mechanisms of the actions of stem cells on hair regeneration in connection with age-related phenotypes.",

Using multi-scale modeling, we show that coupling inhibitors and activators with physical growth of HFs is sufficient to drive periodicity and excitability of hair regeneration. Model simulations and experimental data reveal that mouse skin behaves as a heterogeneous regenerative field, composed of anatomical domains where HFs have distinct cycling dynamics. Interactions between fast-cycling chin and ventral HFs and slow-cycling dorsal HFs produce bilaterally symmetric patterns. Ear skin behaves as a hyper-refractory domain with HFs in extended rest phase. Such hyper-refractivity relates to high levels of BMP ligands and WNT antagonists, in part expressed by ear-specific cartilage and muscle. Hair growth stops at the boundaries with hyper-refractory ears and anatomically discontinuous eyelids, generating wave-breaking effects.

Unlike the epidermis, which regenerates continually, hair follicles anchored in the subcutis periodically regenerate by spontaneous repetitive cycles of growth (anagen), degeneration (catagen), and rest (telogen). The loss of hair follicles in response to injuries or pathologies such as alopecia endangers certain inherent functions of the skin. Thus, it is of interest to understand mechanisms underlying follicular regeneration in adults. In this work, a phytochemical rich in the natural vitamin E tocotrienol (TRF) served as a productive tool to unveil a novel epidermal pathway of hair follicular regeneration. Topical TRF application markedly induced epidermal hair follicle development akin to that during fetal skin development. This was observed in the skin of healthy as well as diabetic mice, which are known to be resistant to anagen hair cycling. TRF suppressed epidermal E-cadherin followed by 4-fold induction of beta-catenin and its nuclear translocation. Nuclear beta-catenin interacted with Tcf3. Such sequestration of Tcf3 from its otherwise known function to repress pluripotent factors induced the plasticity factors Oct4, Sox9, Klf4, c-Myc, and Nanog. Pharmacological inhibition of beta-catenin arrested anagen hair cycling by TRF. This work reports epidermal E-cadherin/beta-catenin as a novel pathway capable of inducing developmental folliculogenesis in the adult skin.",

The interest in alternative material systems and delivery methods for treatment of androgenetic alopecia has been increasing in the recent decades. Topical application of valproic acid (VPA), an FDA-approved anticonvulsant drug, has been shown to effectively stimulate hair follicle (HF) regrowth by upregulating Wnt/beta-catenin, a key pathway involved in initiation of HF development. Moreover, a majority of studies have suggested that cutaneous wound re-epithelialization is capable of inducing HF through Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Here, we report fabrication and evaluation of a novel VPA-encapsulating dissolving microneedle (DMN-VPA) that creates minimally invasive dermal micro-wounds upon application, significantly improving the VPA delivery efficiency. DMN-VPA not only delivers encapsulated VPA with higher accuracy than topical application, it also stimulates wound re-epithelialization signals involved in HF regrowth. Through a series of in vivo studies, we show that micro-wounding-mediated implantation of DMN-VPA upregulates expression of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, alkaline phosphatase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, loricrin and HF stem cell markers, including keratin 15, and CD34 more effectively than topical application.",

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an established imaging technology for in vivo skin investigation. Topical application of gold nanoshells (GNS) provides contrast enhancement in OCT by generating a strong hyperreflective signal from hair follicles and sweat glands, which are the natural skin openings. This study explores the utility of 150 nm diameter GNS as contrast agent for OCT imaging. GNS was massaged into skin and examined in four skin areas of 11 healthy volunteers. A commercial OCT system and a prototype with 3 mum resolution (UHR-OCT) were employed to detect potential benefits of increased resolution and variability in intensity generated by the GNS. In both OCT-systems GNS enhanced contrast from hair follicles and sweat ducts. Highest average penetration depth of GNS was in armpit 0. 64 mm +-SD 0. 17, maximum penetration depth was 1. 20 mm in hair follicles and 15 to 40 mum in sweat ducts. Pixel intensity generated from GNS in hair follicles was significantly higher in UHR-OCT images (P =. 002) and epidermal thickness significantly lower 0. 14 vs 0. 16 mm (P =. 027).

In this study, to further clarify the effects of DECORIN on hair cells and the cycling transition, an in vitro overexpression strategy and Decorin-null (Dcn-/-) mice were used to investigate the effects of DECORIN on outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes. DECORIN overexpression significantly enhanced proliferation and migration in ORS keratinocytes in vitro. Moreover, DECORIN overexpression upregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of WNT10b, beta-CATENIN and LEF1. The DECORIN overexpression-induced increase in the proliferation and migration of ORS keratinocytes was partially inhibited by a Wnt/beta-catenin inhibitor. Furthermore, Dcn-/-mice had a shortened anagen phase and lower levels of beta-catenin expression than were observed in wild-type mice in imaging and histological analyses.

Here, we demonstrate that the randomly oriented hair phenotype observed in frizzled 6 (Fzd6) mutants results from a partial loss of the polarity, due to the functional redundancy of another closely related frizzled gene, Fzd3 Double knockout of Fzd3 and Fzd6 globally, or only in the skin, led to vertically oriented hair follicles and a total loss of anterior-posterior polarity. Furthermore, we provide evidence that, contrary to the prevailing model, asymmetrical localization of the Fzd6 protein is not observed in skin epithelial cells. Through transcriptome analyses and in vitro studies, we show collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (Cthrc1) to be a potential downstream effector of Fzd6, but not of Fzd3. Cthrc1 binds directly to the extracellular domains of Fzd3 and Fzd6 to enhance the Wnt/PCP signaling.

Hair loss, also known as alopecia, is a common dermatological condition of psychosocial significance ; development of therapeutic candidates for the treatment of this condition is, hence, important. Silibinin, a secondary metabolite from Silybum marianum, is an effective antioxidant that also prevents various cutaneous problems. In this study, we have investigated the effect of silibinin on hair induction using three-dimensional (3D) cultured, human dermal papilla (DP) spheroids. Silibinin was found to significantly increase viability through AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) activation in 3D DP spheroids. This was correlated with an increase in the diameter of the 3D DP spheroids. The activation of the wingless and INT-1 (Wnt)/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which is associated with hair growth induction in the DP, was evaluated using the T cell-specific transcription factor and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factor reporter assay ; results indicated significantly increased luciferase activity. In addition, we were able to demonstrate increased expression of the target genes, WNT5a and LEF1, using quantitative real-time PCR assay. Lastly, significantly elevated expression of signature genes associated with hair induction was demonstrated in the 3D DP spheroids treated with silibinin.

BACKGROUND: Dermal papilla cells (DPCs), the \" \" signaling center \" \" of hair follicle (HF), delicately master continual growth of hair in mammals including cashmere, the fine fiber annually produced by secondary HF embedded in cashmere goat skins. Such unparalleled capacity bases on their exquisite character in instructing the cellular activity of hair-forming keratinocytes via secreting numerous molecular signals. Past studies suggested microRNA (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential roles in a wide variety of biological process, including HF cycling. However, their roles and related molecular mechanisms in modulating DPCs secretory activities are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we separately cultivated DPCs and their functionally and morphologically distinct dermal fibroblasts (DFs) from cashmere goat skins at anagen. With the advantage of high throughput RNA-seq, we synchronously identified 2540 lncRNAs and 536 miRNAs from two types of cellular samples at 4th passages. Compared with DFs, 1286 mRNAs, 18 lncRNAs, and 42 miRNAs were upregulated, while 1254 mRNAs, 53 lncRNAs and 44 miRNAs were downregulated in DPCs. Through overlapping with mice data, we ultimately defined 25 core signatures of DPCs, including HOXC8 and RSPO1, two crucial activators for hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Subsequently, we emphatically investigated the impacts of miRNAs and lncRNAs (cis-and trans-acting) on the genes, indicating that ncRNAs extensively exert negative and positive effects on their expressions. Furthermore, we screened lncRNAs acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to sponge miRNAs and relief their repressive effects on targeted genes, and constructed related lncRNAs-miRNAs-HOXC8/RSPO1 interactive lines using bioinformatic tools. As a result, XR _ 310320. 3-chi-miR-144-5p-HOXC8, XR _ 311077. 2-novel _ 624-RSPO1 and others lines appeared, displaying that lncRNAs might serve as ceRNAs to indirectly adjust HFSCs status in hair growth. CONCLUSION: The present study provides an unprecedented inventory of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in goat DPCs and DFs.

Dermal sheath (DS) is located at the outermost border of hair follicles, comprising the connective tissue sheath of these follicles ; DS cells are known to contribute to hair cycling and follicle neogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which DS cells contribute to hair formation are currently unclear. We investigated the global transcriptional profile of human DS cells in early passaged culture, compared with those of human dermal papilla cells (DP cells) and dermal fibroblasts. Vascular related genes were highly expressed in DS cells, and expression of the multi-ligand receptor, CD36, was significantly higher in DS cells than in DP cells. Further analyses with whole-mount imaging technique showed that dense networks of blood capillaries were formed in the DS of human anagen hair follicles, whereas regression of blood capillaries was observed in telogen and catagen hair follicles. We found that CD36-expressing cells were present in populations of DS cells, but were rarely observed in populations of DP cells and fibroblasts. Furthermore, our results indicated that CD36-expressing DS cells may participate in angiogenesis. Therefore, we concluded that CD36-expressing DS cells may modulate blood capillaries in hair follicles, in association with hair cycling.",

To determine the role of flavonoids in the regeneration of pigmented hairs, we applied the candidate flavonoids to the regenerating hair follicles after wounding and identified the flavonoid species that maximally induced pigmented hair regeneration. Flavonoids with two OH groups in the B-ring, such as sterubin, luteolin, and hydroxygenkwanin, showed promising effects in regenerating black pigmented hairs, while those with one OH group in the B-ring showed no significant change.

BACKGROUND: Clinical outcomes of eyebrow restoration with single-follicular-unit hair transplantation largely depend on the surgeon ' s anatomic knowledge, experience, and technical skills. AIMS: To evaluate the effect of the reconstruction with single follicular unit transplantation on eyebrow loss and provide technical tips. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 352 patients with eyebrow loss were recruited. A template of the restoration region was modeled or specifically designed. The scalp strips from the back occipital or retro-auricular regions were harvested for single follicular unit hair. The follicles were transplanted by punching recipient area with 21-G syringe needle. Patients were followed up every 2 months for 4 years after surgery. RESULTS: Out of 352, 320 (91%) patients had their transplanted hair grow well with satisfactory direction and appearance. Seventeen patients (5%) experienced encryption transplantation of a sparse hair for the first 6 months but felt satisfied afterward. Twelve (3%) patients did a simple make-up on the transplanted hair because there was an obvious difference between the transplanted hair and the natural one. Three (1%) patients with burned injury suffered of mild folliculitis and cured by 75% alcohol inunction. All patients had no obvious scar at the donor sites. CONCLUSION: Single follicular transplantation for eyebrow loss resulted in natural restorations with excellent satisfaction. The technique is simple, safe, and effective. The usage of syringe needle, microscope slide forceps, and a magnifier could implant the hair in a right angle, desired direction and depth, and increase the survival rate.",

Hair disorders may considerably impact the social and psychological well-being of an individual. Recent advances in the understanding the biology of hair have encouraged the research and development of novel and safer natural hair growth agents. In this context, we have previously demonstrated-at both preclinical and clinical level-that an Annurca apple-based dietary supplement (AMS), acting as a nutraceutical, is endowed with an intense hair-inductive activity (trichogenicity), at once increasing hair tropism and keratin content. Herein, in the framework of preclinical investigations, new experiments in primary human models of follicular keratinocytes and dermal papilla cells have been performed to give an insight around AMS biological effects on specific hair keratins expression. As well as confirming the biocompatibility and the antioxidant proprieties of our nutraceutical formulation, we have proven an engagement of trichokeratins production underlying its biological effects on human follicular cells. Annurca apples are particularly rich in oligomeric procyanidins, natural polyphenols belonging to the broader class of bioflavonoids believed to exert many beneficial health effects. To our knowledge, none of the current available remedies for hair loss has hitherto shown to stimulate the production of hair keratins so clearly.",

Recent studies have reported that T-reg cells are intimately linked with hair follicles in a stage-dependent manner and play an important role in hair follicle cycling and regeneration in murine skin. Further study revealed that T-reg cell ' s regulation of hair follicle growth is through its preferential expression of the Notch ligand Jagged-1 (Jag1), which facilitates hair follicle regeneration. However, the role of Jag1 in androgen-suppressed hair growth is yet to be investigated. In addition, although epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a mitogen for cells including skin cells, whether it works synergistically with Jag1 to enhance hair follicle development is unknown. The current study intended to investigate effects of topical application of Jag1 on androgen-suppressed hair growth, and to determine the potential synergistic effect of EGF and Jag1 in this process in vivo. Fifty mice were depilated at the dorsal back area to achieve synchronized anagen development, and randomly divided into five groups with the following topical treatments control for 14 days ; testosterone to induce androgenetic alopecia ; Jagged1 (testosterone + Jagged1) ; EGF (testosterone + EGF) ; and Jagged1 + EGF (testosterone + Jagged1 + EGF). It was found that EGF and Jag1 by itself respectively, did not promote androgen-suppressed hair growth significantly. This stimulating effect was enhanced in the presence of both EGF and Jagged1 (p < 0. 05). The hair growth promoting effect was accompanied by better follicle growth, which is associated with increased cell proliferation in the hair follicle and altered the expression of genes that are important in hair follicular cell proliferation and differentiation. Our results provide insights into the therapeutic potential of these peptides for androgenetic alopecia.",

The hair follicle (HF) is considered a \" \" mini-organ, \" \" consisting of intricate and well-organized structures which originate from HF stem and progenitor cells. Dermal papilla cells are the main components of the mesenchymal compartments in the hair bulb and are instrumental in generating signals to regulate the behavior of neighboring epithelial cells during the hair cycle.

This review summarizes the current understanding of HF development, repair, and regeneration, with special focus on cell signaling pathways governing these processes.

BACKGROUND: The human placenta (HP) is a complex organ used to alleviate tiredness and promote wound healing. Previous research showed the hair growth-promoting effect of HP. However, no reports have addressed the effects of HP on hair regrowth in chemotherapy-induced alopecia. In this study, we investigated the effects of HP on the apoptosis and proliferation of hair follicles in chemotherapy-induced alopecia. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice in telogen were depilated to enter anagen. After 9 days, dystrophic catagen was induced by the intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. During 9 to 16 days, 0. 1 and 1 mg/mL HP were topically applied to depilated dorsal skin. RESULTS: Dystrophic hair follicles by cyclophosphamide were recovered by HP treatment. New hair shafts containing hair fibers appeared to be straight after HP treatment. Immunohistological staining revealed a significant increase of Ki67-positive cells in hair follicles treated with 1 mg/mL HP. Topical HP treatment increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, while it attenuated the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax, p53, and cytochrome c with caspase-9 and-3.

The hair follicle is an excellent mini-system illustrating the mechanisms governing organogenesis and regeneration. Although the general mechanisms modulating skin and hair follicle development are widely studied in mouse and chicken models, the delicate network regulating skin and hair diversity remains largely unclear. Sheep is an additional model to address the various wool characteristics observed in nature. The coarse and fine wool sheep with diverse fibers were examined to show differences in the primary wool follicle size and skin thickness. The molecular dynamics in skin staged at the primary wool follicle induction between two sheep lines were investigated by RNA-sequencing analyses to generate 1994 differentially expressed genes revealing marker genes for epithelium (6 genes), dermal condensate (38 genes) and dermal fibroblast (58 genes) highly correlated with skin and wool follicle morphological differences. The DEGs were enriched in GO terms represented by epithelial cell migration and differentiation, regulation of hair follicle development and ectodermal placode formation, and KEGG pathways typified by WNT and Hedgehog signaling pathways governing the differences of skin structure. The qPCR detection of 9 genes confirmed the similar expression tendency with RNA-sequencing profiles. This comparative study of coarse and fine wool sheep skin reveals the presence of skin and wool follicle differences at primary wool follicle induction stage, and indicates the potential effectors (APCDD1, FGF20, DKK1, IGFBP3 and SFRP4) regulating the skin compartments during the early morphogenesis of primary wool follicles to shape the variable wool fiber thickness in later developmental stages.",

    "text": "The biology of human hair greying. Hair greying (canities) is one of the earliest, most visible ageing-associated phenomena, whose modulation by genetic, psychoemotional, oxidative, senescence-associated, metabolic and nutritional factors has long attracted skin biologists, dermatologists, and industry. Greying is of profound psychological and commercial relevance in increasingly ageing populations. In addition, the onset and perpetuation of defective melanin production in the human anagen hair follicle pigmentary unit (HFPU) provides a superb model for interrogating the molecular mechanisms of ageing in a complex human mini-organ, and greying-associated defects in bulge melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) represent an intriguing system of neural crest-derived stem cell senescence. Here, we emphasize that human greying invariably begins with the gradual decline in melanogenesis, including reduced tyrosinase activity, defective melanosome transfer and apoptosis of HFPU melanocytes, and is thus a primary event of the anagen hair bulb, not the bulge. Eventually, the bulge MSC pool becomes depleted as well, at which stage greying becomes largely irreversible. There is still no universally accepted model of human hair greying, and the extent of genetic contributions to greying remains unclear. However, oxidative damage likely is a crucial driver of greying via its disruption of HFPU melanocyte survival, MSC maintenance, and of the enzymatic apparatus of melanogenesis itself. While neuroendocrine factors [e. g. alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), ss-endorphin, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)], and micropthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) are well-known regulators of human hair follicle melanocytes and melanogenesis, how exactly these and other factors [e. g. thyroid hormones, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), P-cadherin, peripheral clock activity] modulate greying requires more detailed study. Other important open questions include how HFPU melanocytes age intrinsically, how psychoemotional stress impacts this process, and how current insights into the gerontobiology of the human HFPU can best be translated into retardation or reversal of greying.",

Diverse RIPK1/3 inhibitors and siRNA were tested in the human outer-root sheath (ORS) cells and animal models. The expression and hair cycle-dependent expression of RIPK 1, respectively, were investigated in the hair follicles (HF) of human, pig, and the mouse. Resulting from the experiment, Nec-1s was most effective in the hair growth promotion among several inhibitors. Nec-1s induced the ORS cell proliferation and migration, and increased the HF length in mouse and pig organ cultures. In addition, it accelerated the telogen-to-anagen transition and elongated the anagen period in the mouse model. Both apoptosis and necroptosis were detected in hair cycle. RIPK1 and RIPK3 were highly expressed in ORS cells during the hair regression period. Nec-1s upregulated the mRNA expression of Wnt3a and Wnt5b, and the activity of beta-catenin. Collectively, Nec-1s promotes hair growth through inhibiting necroptosis and activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

However, this approach is insensitive to subdermal hair and cannot identify follicle orientation. Here, we introduce a fast and non-invasive imaging technique to measure follicle density and angles across regions of varying density. We first showed that hair is a significant source of photoacoustic signal. We then selected regions of low, medium, and high follicle density and showed that photoacoustic imaging can measure the density of follicles even when they are not visible by eye. We performed handheld imaging by sweeping the transducer across the imaging area to generate 3D images via maximum intensity projection. Background signal from the dermis was removed using a skin tracing method. Measurement of follicle density using photoacoustic imaging was highly correlated with photographic determination (R2 = 0. 96).

However, the mechanisms in androgenetic alopecia are still unclear, and the treatment methods are also limited. Therefore, further study on the pathogenesis and new therapies for androgenetic alopecia are urgently needed. In this study, we found that endogenous autophagy was severely impaired, accompanied by increased apoptosis in early catagen-like miniaturized hair follicles from the balding scalps of androgenetic alopecia patients. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy using 3-methyladenine could induce apoptosis, premature hair follicle regression and slow down the hair growth in organ-cultured hair follicles. Taken together, these results suggest that impairment of autophagy could be a potential mechanism in androgenetic alopecia.",

    "text": "HIF-1alpha Stimulators Function Equally to Leading Hair Loss Agents in Enhancing Dermal Papilla Growth. INTRODUCTION: Androgenic alopecia (AGA) occurs due to progressive miniaturization of the dermal papilla (DP). During this process the hair follicle loses nutrition over time and eventually dies, causing the hair to fall out. Recent evidence suggests that hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1alpha) modulation may counteract hair loss. This study aims to evaluate the proliferation of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) under the influence of a selection of commercially available topical hair loss drugs, compared to HIF-1alpha-stimulating agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the hanging drop method, DPCs self-organized into spheroid shape, mirroring the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the DP in vivo. DP analogs were treated with established substances against AGA (minoxidil and caffeine) compared to HIF-1alpha-stimulating agents (deferoxamine [DFO] and deferiprone [DFP]), at 10 mM doses. DP analogs were simultaneously stained with 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) to evaluate impact of drug compounds on DP daughter cell production. Concurrently, fluorescent microscopy visualization of migration of daughter cells after 48 h in culture was performed. RESULTS: DPC proliferation within the spheroid structure was significantly enhanced by caffeine, minoxidil, and the HIF-1alpha-stimulating agent DFP when compared to control. Highest proliferation was seen in the DFP-treated DP analogs. Migration of peripheral DP daughter cells was highest in control and DFO groups. CONCLUSION: Here we demonstrate a significantly enhanced proliferative activity for both established substances against AGA (minoxidil and caffeine) and the HIF-1alpha-stimulating agent DFP in a 3D DPC spheroid culture model with equal results for DFP and minoxidil. These favorable characteristics make such compounds potential water-soluble alternatives to minoxidil.",

BACKGROUND: The upper follicular compartment, a well-known reservoir of cutaneous microbiota, constitutes a space for intensive cross-barrier dialogue. The lower follicle comprises the bulb and bulge, structures with relative immune-privileged status, crucial for physiological cycling, and widely considered to be microbial-free. OBJECTIVES: Following our initial immunohistochemical screening for regulatory cytokines and defensin expression in anagen hair follicles, we aimed to confirm our results with a follow-up ELISA investigation. We postulated that exposure to microbial components may trigger expression, and thus opted to investigate microbial presence in this area. MATERIALS & METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical staining for selected cytokines and antimicrobial peptides, and Gram and Giemsa staining on tissue sections from healthy individuals. Based on ELISA analyses, we confirmed a marked presence of IL-17A-and HBD2 in infrainfundibular compartments from plucked anagen hair follicles of 12 individuals (six females, six males ; frontal and occipital scalp sites). 16S rRNA sequencing on microbial DNA extracted from lower follicles, as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were applied to explore bacterial presence in the infrainfundibular compartments. RESULTS: 16S rRNA sequencing yielded reproducible data of bacterial presence in infrainfundibular compartments of plucked scalp follicles ; Lawsonella clevelandensis, Staphylococcaceae and Propionibacteriaceae were the most abundant bacteria. Also, FISH revealed biofilm structures formed by Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) and Staphylococcus sp. below the infundibulum. CONCLUSION: As the skin microbiome largely influences the local immune system, the presence of bacteria in proximity to follicular immune-privileged areas may be of relevance to hair cycling in health and disease.",

The simplicity of collecting hair samples and the observable state of hair growth has significant advantages ; we tried to explore whether the parameters related to hair growth could be used as auxiliary indicators to evaluate a depression model in animals. The length and weight of the hair were calculated. Correlation analysis was conducted between the depressive behavioral results and the glucocorticoid levels in hair and serum. Learned helplessness combined with chronic restraint stress, and chronic unpredictable stress in the animal were detectable by superficial observation, weight ratio, and length of hair, and follicular development scores were significantly reduced compared to the control. The hair growth parameters of rats with depression, the rise in corticosterone, and the corresponding changes in behavioral parameters were significantly correlated.

    "text": "The Rise of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Approach to Hair Restoration. SUMMARY: The advent of pluripotent stem cells following the discovery of Shinya Yamanaka (2012 Nobel prize in Medicine) brought about a regenerative medicine approach to virtually every human condition including hair loss. It is now possible to reprogram somatic cells (eg, blood or skin cells) from a person experiencing hair loss to generate autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which could be amplified and cryopreserved. Subsequently, these iPSCs could be differentiated into various cell types such as dermal papilla cells, epithelial cells, melanocytes, and other cell types constituting functional hair follicle. Transplantation of human iPSC-derived folliculogenic cells into the nude mice has successfully generated xenografts with hair outgrowth. Because iPSCs provide a virtually unlimited source of folliculogenic cells for de novo formation of hair follicles, this approach has major advantages over current surgical hair restoration procedures, which merely redistribute existing hair follicles from one part of the sculp to another. Combined with robotics and automation of the transplantation process, this novel regenerative medicine approach is well poised to make hair restoration a routine procedure affordable for everybody who can benefit from it.",

Hair follicle development in Tan sheep differs significantly between the birth and Er-mao periods, but the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. We profiled the skin transcriptomes of Tan sheep in the birth and Er-mao periods via RNA-seq technology. The Tan sheep examined consisted of three sheep in the birth period and three sheep in the Er-mao period. A total of 364 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the skin of Tan sheep between the birth period and the Er-mao period were identified, among which 168 were upregulated and 196 were downregulated. Interestingly, the FOS proto-oncogene (FOS) (fold change = 22. 67, P value = 2. 15 * 10 ^-44) was the most significantly differentially expressed gene. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis found that the FOS gene was significantly enriched in the signaling pathway related to hair follicle development. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the FOS gene was expressed in the skin of Chinese Tan sheep at the birth and Er-mao periods, with significantly higher expression in the Er-mao period. Our findings suggest that the FOS gene promotes hair follicle development in Tan sheep.",

Various studies addressing the increasing problem of hair loss, using natural products with few side effects, have been conducted. 5-bromo-3, 4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (BDB) exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in mouse models of atopic dermatitis and inhibited UVB-induced oxidative stress in keratinocytes. Here, we investigated its stimulating effect and the underlying mechanism of action on hair growth using rat vibrissa follicles and dermal papilla cells (DPCs), required for the regulation of hair cycle and length. BDB increased the length of hair fibers in rat vibrissa follicles and the proliferation of DPCs, along with causing changes in the levels of cell cycle-related proteins. We investigated whether BDB could trigger anagen-activating signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and autophagy in DPCs. BDB induces activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway through the phosphorylation of GSG3beta and beta-catenin. BDB increased the levels of autophagic vacuoles and autophagy regulatory proteins Atg7, Atg5, Atg16L, and LC3B. We also investigated whether BDB inhibits the TGF-beta pathway, which promotes transition to the catagen phase. BDB inhibited the phosphorylation of Smad2 induced by TGF-beta1. Thus, BDB can promote hair growth by modulating anagen signaling by activating Wnt/beta-catenin and autophagy pathways and inhibiting the TGF-beta pathway in DPCs.",

BACKGROUND: The frontal-temporal triangle area (FTTA) hair has a slow growth rate and thin caliber, which are similar to those of eyebrow hair. However, a comparison of cosmetic outcomes between FTTA and other scalp hair grafts in eyebrow transplantation has not been performed. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cosmetic outcomes of FTTA hair and periauricular and occipital area (POA) hair in eyebrow restoration. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 155 patients with FTTA or POA hair transplants was performed. Comparative variables included patient characteristics, hair density, diameter, percentage of one-hair follicular units (FUs), number of transplanted FUs, harvesting time, transection rate, hair survival rate, frequency of eyebrow trimming, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in hair density, diameter, percentage of one-hair FUs, and harvesting time between the FTTA and POA hair transplants. The FTTA hair grew significantly slower than the POA hair did. The patients in the FTTA group trimmed their postoperative eyebrows at a significantly longer interval than those in the POA group. The percentage of patients who were very satisfied with the surgery results was higher in the FTTA group. CONCLUSION: The FTTA hair grafts can provide aesthetically pleasing cosmetic results in eyebrow restoration.",

In the present study, we designed a nanoparticle formulation containing 5% MXD (MXD-NPs) using the bead mill method and investigated the hair-growth effect of MXD-NPs and a commercially available MXD solution (CA-MXD). Hair growth and in vivo permeation studies were conducted using C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, we examined the MXD contents in the upper (hair bulge) and the lower hair follicle (hair bulb) and observed the hair follicle epithelial stem cells (HFSC) by immunohistochemical staining using the CD200 antibody. The mean particle size of the MXD in the MXD-NPs was 139. 8 nm +-8. 9 nm. The hair-growth effect of the MXD-NPs was higher than that of CA-MXD, and the MXD content in the hair bulge of mice treated with MXD-NPs was 7. 4-fold that of the mice treated with CA-MXD. In addition, the activation of HFSC was observed around the bulge in the MXD-NPs-treated mice. We showed that MXD-NPs enable the accumulation of MXD in the upper hair follicles more efficiently than CA-MXD, leading the activation of HFSC and the hair growth.",

The skin tissue of the scalp is unique from other skin tissues because it coexists with hair, and many differences in microbial composition have been confirmed. In scalp tissues, hair loss occurs due to a combination of internal and external factors, and several studies are being conducted to counteract this. However, not many studies have addressed hair loss from the perspective of the microbiome. In this study, subjects with hair loss and those with normal scalps were set as experimental and control groups, respectively. In the experimental group, hair loss had progressed, and there was a large difference in microbiome composition compared to the group with normal scalps. In particular, differences in Accumulibacter, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium were found. From Staphylococcus epidermidis Cicaria, two active components were isolated as a result of repeated column chromatography. Spectroscopic data led to the determination of chemical structures for adenosine and biotin. Fractions were obtained, and ex vivo tests were conducted using hair follicles derived from human scalp tissue. When the microbiome adenosine-treated group was compared to the control group, hair follicle length was increased, and hair root diameter was maintained during the experimental periods. In addition, the Cicaria culture medium and the microbial adenosine-and biotin-treated groups maintained the anagen phase, reducing progression to the catagen phase in the hair growth cycle. In conclusion, it was confirmed that the Cicaria culture medium and the microbial adenosine and biotin derived from the culture were effective in inhibiting hair loss.",

Hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling were examined in transgenic mice that overexpress the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor Noggin under the control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter. The Noggin transgene was misexpressed in the proximal portion of the hair follicle, primarily the matrix cells, apart from the usual expression in neurons. Transgene expression appeared only after induction of both the primary (tylotrich) and secondary (nontylotrich) pelage hair follicles had already occurred, thus allowing examination of the role of BMP signaling in follicles that had been induced normally in the presence of BMPs. The overexpression of Noggin in these animals resulted in a dramatic loss of hair postnatally. There was an apparently normal, but shortened period of postnatal hair follicle morphogenesis, followed by premature initiation of hair follicle cycling via entry into the first catagen transformation. This resulted in a complete loss of hair shafts from the nontylotrich hair follicles in these mice while the tylotrich hair follicles were normal. The onset of anagen of the first postnatal hair follicle cycle was also accelerated in the transgenic mice. Our results show that BMP signaling is specifically required for proper proliferation and differentiation during late morphogenesis of nontylotrich hair follicles and that inhibition of this signaling pathway may be one of the triggers for the onset of catagen when the follicles are in anagen and the onset of anagen when the follicles are in telogen. Ectopic sebocyte differentiation was another hallmark of the phenotype of these transgenic mice suggesting that BMP signaling may be an important determinant of lineage selection by common progenitor cells in the skin. BMPs likely promote a hair follicle-type differentiation pathway of keratinocytes while suppressing the sebaceous differentiation pathway of skin epithelium.",

This study aimed to gauge the cross-appendage inductive capabilities of cultured tooth dental papilla (or pulp) cells from different species and ages of donor. Adult human and juvenile rat tooth papilla cells were implanted into surgically inactivated hair follicles within two different microenvironments. The human cells interacted with follicle epithelium to regenerate new end bulbs and create multiple differentiated hair fibers.

    "text": "Hair follicle pigmentation. Hair shaft melanin components (eu-or/and pheomelanin) are a long-lived record of precise interactions in the hair follicle pigmentary unit, e. g., between follicular melanocytes, keratinocytes, and dermal papilla fibroblasts. Follicular melanogenesis (FM) involves sequentially the melanogenic activity of follicular melanocytes, the transfer of melanin granules into cortical and medulla keratinocytes, and the formation of pigmented hair shafts. This activity is in turn regulated by an array of enzymes, structural and regulatory proteins, transporters, and receptors and their ligands, acting on the developmental stages, cellular, and hair follicle levels. FM is stringently coupled to the anagen stage of the hair cycle, being switched-off in catagen to remain absent through telogen. At the organ level FM is precisely coupled to the life cycle of melanocytes with changes in their compartmental distribution and accelerated melanoblast/melanocyte differentiation with enhanced secretory activity. The melanocyte compartments in the upper hair follicle also provides a reservoir for the repigmentation of epidermis and, for the cyclic formation of new anagen hair bulbs. Melanin synthesis and pigment transfer to bulb keratinocytes are dependent on the availability of melanin precursors, and regulation by signal transduction pathways intrinsic to skin and hair follicle, which are both receptor dependent and independent, act through auto-, para-or intracrine mechanisms and can be modified by hormonal signals. The important regulators are MC1 receptor its and adrenocorticotropic hormone, melanocyte stimulating hormone, agouti protein ligands (in rodents), c-Kit, and the endothelin receptors with their ligands. Melanin itself has a wide range of bioactivities that extend far beyond its determination of hair color.",

Hair follicles undergo cycles of proliferation and apoptotic regression, offering an excellent paradigm to study how this transition is governed. Several factors are known to affect the hair cycle, but it remains a mystery whether Akt kinases that are downstream of growth factor signaling impact this equilibrium. We now show that an Akt relative, Sgk (serum and glucocorticoid responsive kinase) 3, plays a critical role in this process. Hair follicles of mice lacking Sgk3 fail to mature normally. Proliferation is reduced, apoptosis is increased, and follicles prematurely regress. Maintenance of the pool of transiently amplifying matrix cells is impaired. Intriguingly, loss of Sgk3 resembles the gain of function of epidermal growth factor signaling. Using cultured primary keratinocytes, we find that Sgk3 functions by negatively regulating phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signaling.

In order to better characterize the phenotypic differences between human keratinocyte stem cells and their daughter TA cells, we compared the in vitro properties of cell adhesion, cell migration, clonogenicity, and in vitro life span. Epithelial outgrowths from the hair matrix appeared within 2 d of explant, whereas stem cell outgrowths appeared between 7 and 10 d after explant. Both populations form colonies ; however, stem cells from telogen follicles formed more total colonies, and more colonies greater than 3 mm. Upon subculture, stem cells formed colonies until passage 6 and terminally differentiated at passage 7, whereas TA cells only formed colonies until passage 2. Stem cells express more beta1 integrin and adhere more rapidly to collagen IV. Most strikingly, TA cells showed a 7-fold greater mobility on migration assays than stem cells (0. 704 vs 0. 102 microm per min).

    "text": "Epilation today: physiology of the hair follicle and clinical photo-epilation. Despite the variations of length and type of hair (vellus or terminal), the growth of human hair in all body sites is cyclic. Phases of active hair growth, or anagen, are separated by periods of quiescence, or telogen. The duration of both phases varies greatly depending on the body site. Whether hairs are in anagen/telogen at the time of hair removal is important because only anagen hairs are particularly sensible to physical insults. Photo-epilation is a technique for long-term removal of unwanted hair by thermal destruction of the hair follicle and its reproductive system (stems cells). As melanin is the main chromophor existing in hair follicles the corresponding wavelength spectrum would range from ultraviolet up to infrared light. Furthermore longer wavelengths are preferred as the cromophor lies deep in the skin and the penetration of light is increasing with the wavelength. Thus, in the range of 600-1100 nm melanin absorption may be used for selective photothermolysis of hair follicles. Yet to be resolved questions for permanent destruction are the location of the key follicular target and the possible influence of the hair growth cycle on photothermolysis-induced hair removal. An overview on the individual physiology of the hair follicle is given to discuss the latest strategies for photo-epilation.",

    "text": "Inhibitory autocrine factors produced by the mesenchyme-derived hair follicle dermal papilla may be a key to male pattern baldness. BACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia, or male pattern baldness, is a common, progressive disorder where large, terminal scalp hairs are gradually replaced by smaller hairs in precise patterns until only tiny vellus hairs remain. This balding can cause a marked reduction in the quality of life. Although these changes are driven by androgens, most molecular mechanisms are unknown, limiting available treatments. The mesenchyme-derived dermal papilla at the base of the mainly epithelial hair follicle controls the type of hair produced and is probably the site through which androgens act on follicle cells by altering the regulatory paracrine factors produced by dermal papilla cells. During changes in hair size the relationship between the hair and dermal papilla size remains constant, with alterations in both dermal papilla volume and cell number. This suggests that alterations within the dermal papilla itself play a key role in altering hair size in response to androgens. Cultured dermal papilla cells offer a useful model system to investigate this as they promote new hair growth in vivo, retain characteristics in vitro which reflect their parent follicle ' s response to androgens in vivo and secrete mitogenic factors for dermal papilla cells and keratinocytes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether cultured dermal papilla cells from balding follicles secrete altered amounts/types of mitogenic factors for dermal papilla cells than those from larger, normal follicles. We also aimed to determine whether rodent cells would recognize mitogenic signals from human cells in vitro and whether factors produced by balding dermal papilla cells could alter the start of a new mouse hair cycle in vivo. METHODS: Dermal papilla cells were cultured from normal, balding and almost clinically normal areas of balding scalps and their ability to produce mitogenic factors compared using both human and rat whisker dermal papilla cells as in vitro targets and mouse hair growth in vivo. RESULTS: Normal scalp cells produced soluble factors which stimulated the growth of both human scalp and rat whisker dermal papilla cells in vitro, demonstrating dose-responsive mitogenic capability across species. Although balding cells stimulated some growth, this was much reduced and they also secreted inhibitory factor (s). Balding cell media also delayed new hair growth when injected into mice. CONCLUSIONS: Human balding dermal papilla cells secrete inhibitory factors which affect the growth of both human and rodent dermal papilla cells and factors which delay the onset of anagen in mice in vivo. These inhibitory factor (s) probably cause the formation of smaller dermal papillae and smaller hairs in male pattern baldness. Identification of such factor (s) could lead to novel therapeutic approaches.",

Later, studies successively demonstrated that bulge cells possess stem cell properties such as high proliferative capacity and multipotency to regenerate not only hair follicles but also sebaceous glands and epidermis.

Importantly, novel cell surface markers were identified on human bulge cells using precise laser capture microdissection and microarray analyses.

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) links integrins to the actin cytoskeleton and is believed to phosphorylate several target proteins. We report that a keratinocyte-restricted deletion of the ILK gene leads to epidermal defects and hair loss. ILK-deficient epidermal keratinocytes exhibited a pronounced integrin-mediated adhesion defect leading to epidermal detachment and blister formation, disruption of the epidermal-dermal basement membrane, and the translocation of proliferating, integrin-expressing keratinocytes to suprabasal epidermal cell layers. The mutant hair follicles were capable of producing hair shaft and inner root sheath cells and contained stem cells and generated proliferating progenitor cells, which were impaired in their downward migration and hence accumulated in the outer root sheath and failed to replenish the hair matrix. In vitro studies with primary ILK-deficient keratinocytes attributed the migration defect to a reduced migration velocity and an impaired stabilization of the leading-edge lamellipodia, which compromised directional and persistent migration. We conclude that ILK plays important roles for epidermis and hair follicle morphogenesis by modulating integrin-mediated adhesion, actin reorganization, and plasma membrane dynamics in keratinocytes.",

One of the major adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy is cutaneous atrophy, often followed by the development of resistance to steroids. It is accepted that epithelial stem cells (SCs) located in the hair follicle bulge divide during times of epidermal proliferative need. We determined whether follicular epithelial SCs and their transit amplifying progeny were stimulated to proliferate in response to the chronic application of glucocorticoid fluocinolone acetonide (FA). After first two applications of FA, keratinocyte proliferation in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and hair follicles was minimal and resulted in significant epidermal hypoplasia. We observed that a 50% depletion of the interfollicular keratinocyte population triggered a proliferative response. Unexpectedly, less than 2% of the proliferating keratinocytes were located in the bulge region of the hair follicle, whereas 82% were in IFE. It is known that cell desensitization to glucocorticoids is mediated via temporary decrease of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression. We found that GR expression was significantly decreased in IFE keratinocytes after each FA treatment. In contrast, many bulge keratinocytes retained GR in the nucleus. Our results indicate that bulge keratinocytes, including follicular SCs, are more sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of glucocorticoids than basal keratinocytes, possibly due to the incomplete process of desensitization.",

Skin-derived precursor cells (SKPs) are multipotent neural crest-related stem cells that grow as self-renewing spheres and are capable of generating neurons and myelinating glial cells. SKPs are of clinical interest because they are accessible and potentially autologous. However, although spheres can be readily isolated from embryonic and neonatal skin, SKP frequency falls away sharply in adulthood, and primary sphere generation from adult human skin is more problematic. In addition, the culture-initiating cell population is undefined and heterogeneous, limiting experimental studies addressing important aspects of these cells such as the behavior of endogenous precursors in vivo and the molecular mechanisms of neural generation. Using a combined fate-mapping and microdissection approach, we identified and characterized a highly enriched niche of neural crest-derived sphere-forming cells within the dermal papilla of the hair follicle of adult skin. We demonstrated that the dermal papilla of the rodent vibrissal follicle is 1, 000-fold enriched for sphere-forming neural crest-derived cells compared with whole facial skin. These \" \" papillaspheres \" \" share a phenotypic and developmental profile similar to that of SKPs, can be readily expanded in vitro, and are able to generate both neuronal and glial cells in response to appropriate cues. We demonstrate that papillaspheres can be efficiently generated and expanded from adult human facial skin by microdissection of a single hair follicle. This strategy of targeting a highly enriched niche of sphere-forming cells provides a novel and efficient method for generating neuronal and glial cells from an accessible adult somatic source that is both defined and minimally invasive. \"",

Self-aggregation is key to hair follicle (HF) induction ability of dermal papilla (DP) cells and neogenesis of HF can be achieved by transplanting DP microtissues. However, there is currently lack of a suitable system that allows efficient production of DP microtissues and analysis of DP self-aggregation in vitro. We demonstrate that, at a higher seeding cell density, poly (ethylene-co-vinyl alcohol) (EVAL) membranes facilitate DP self-assembly into many compact spheroidal microtissues that are able to induce new HFs. This self-assembling process is associated with an enhanced cell movement and a declined cell-substrate adhesivity on EVAL. A compromised cell growth is also revealed on EVAL. On the contrary, a more adherent surface allows faster cell expansion but maintains DP cells in a flat morphology. Dynamically, cell migration, intercellular collision and intercellular adhesion contribute to DP microtissue formation on EVAL. Our results suggest that, for large-scale production of DP microtissues for HF regeneration, an adhesive surface is needed for quick cell expansion and a biomaterial with a lower adhesivity is required for self-aggregation. In addition, this system can be a model for investigation of DP self-aggregation in vitro.",

Basal bulge cells were mainly K15 + CD200 + CD34 (-) CD271 (-), and suprabasal cells were K15 (-) CD200 + CD34 (-) CD271 (-). We categorized follicular cells into nine subpopulations according to biomarker expression profiles. The CD200 + CD34 (-) bulge cells had much higher colony-forming abilities than the CD34 + population, and were divided into two subpopulations: a CD200 + CD34 (-) FSC (high) (K15-rich, basal) and a CD200 + CD34 (-) FSC (low) (K15-poor, suprabasal) population. The former formed fewer but larger-sized colonies than the latter. Follicular epithelial cell cultivation resulted in loss of K15, CD200, CD34, and CD271 expression, but maintenance of K14, CD29, and CD49f expression.

Here, we examine the dynamic behavior of adult hair follicle stem cells in their normal setting by employing mice with repressible H2B-GFP expression to track cell divisions and Cre-inducible mice to perform long-term single-cell lineage tracing. We provide direct evidence for the infrequent stem cell division model in intact tissue. Moreover, we find that differentiation of progenitor cells occurs at different times and tissue locations than self-renewal of stem cells.

BACKGROUND: Wnt10b (wingless-related mouse mammary tumour virus integration site 10b) plays various roles in a wide range of biological actions, including hair-follicle development. AIM: To assess the roles that Wnt10b plays in postnatal hair-follicle growth. METHODS: Adenovirus vectors AdWnt10b, AdGFP, AdGFP plus AdRFP, AdWnt10b plus AdFrzB, and AdWnt10b plus AdSimBC were co-cultured separately with vibrissae. In situ protein expression of Wnt10b, beta-catenin and Lef1 was determined by immunohistochemistry, and the proliferation status of the hair follicle was detected by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling. The presence of Wnt signalling molecules in the three stages of hair-follicle growth was detected by PCR-based microarray. RESULTS: AdWnt10b-infected cells were able to secrete bioactive Wnt10b, and when this was added into the basal medium, the vibrissae grew faster than in control medium or in medium containing canonical Wnt signalling antagonists. The in situ protein expression of Wnt10b was consistent with that of beta-catenin and Lef1. The expression locus of Wnt10b was almost the same as the proliferating cells labelled by BrdU in the anagen hair follicle. CONCLUSIONS: Wnt10b may promote hair-follicle growth by inducing the switch from telogen to anagen via a canonical Wnt signalling pathway to promote the proliferation of matrix cells.",

BACKGROUND: AEC (ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-clefting) syndrome is an autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia disorder caused by mutations in the transcription factor p63. Clinically, the skin is dry and often fragile ; other features can include partial eyelid fusion (ankyloblepharon), hypodontia, orofacial clefting, sparse hair or alopecia, and nail dystrophy. OBJECTIVES: To investigate how p63 gene mutations affect gene and protein expression in AEC syndrome skin. METHODS: We performed microarray analysis on samples of intact and eroded AEC syndrome skin compared with control skin. Changes were verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and, for basal keratinocyte-associated genes, by immunohistochemistry and analysis of microdissected skin. RESULTS: We identified significant upregulation of six genes and downregulation of 69 genes in AEC syndrome skin, with the main changes in genes implicated in epidermal adhesion, skin barrier formation and hair follicle biology. There was reduced expression of genes encoding the basement membrane proteins FRAS1 and collagen VII, as well as the skin barrier-associated small proline-rich proteins 1A and 4, late cornified envelope protein 5A, hornerin, and lipid transporters including ALOX15B. Reduced expression of the hair-associated keratins 25, 27, 31, 33B, 34, 35, 81 and 85 was also noted. We also confirmed similar alterations in gene expression for 26 of the 75 genes in eroded AEC scalp skin. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies specific changes in skin structural biology and signalling pathways that result from mutant p63 and provides new molecular insight into the AEC syndrome phenotype.",

    "text": "Fundamental hair follicle biology and fine fibre production in animals. Hair ' fine ' fibre is an important commercial product of farmed and certain wild animal species. The fibre is produced in follicles embedded in skin. These have properties in common with other tissues of the integument and have importance in determining yield and quality of fibre. Means of understanding and improving these characteristics are informed by knowledge of integumental and follicle biology. This paper reviews contemporary information that identifies the major fibre-producing species and their production characteristic. It surveys knowledge describing fundamental biology of the integument and considers information derived for the hair follicle from studies on a number of species including genetically modified mice. It identifies the composition of the follicle and describes components and interrelationships between epidermal hair-fibre producing epidermis and fibroblast-and connective tissue-containing dermis. The structure of different primary and secondary follicle types, and associated structures, are described. Focus is given to the alterations in anatomy and in behaviour from active to inactive state, which occurs during the hair follicle cycle. Information is provided on the anatomical substructures (hair medulla, cortex, cuticles and supporting sheaths and dermal papilla), cellular and extracellular composition, and adhesion and chemical signalling systems, which regulate development from the early embryo to post-natal state and subsequent cycling. Such signalling involves the dermis and its specialist fibroblasts, which secrete signalling molecules, which along with those from local epidermis and systemic sources, largely determine structure and function of epidermal cells. Such chemical signalling typically includes endocrine-, paracrine-, autocrine-and juxtacrine-acting molecules and interactions with their receptors located on cell membranes or intracellularly with transduction of message mediated by transcription factors at gene level. Important hormones and growth factors and inhibitors regulating morphogenic and/or mitogenic activity are identified. These mediate mechanisms associated with presence or absence in skin and development of patterning for primary or secondary follicles. Reference is made to deposition of individual keratins and keratin-associated proteins in follicle sub-structures and to fibre properties such as length, diameter, medullation, crimp and lustre. Pre-and post-natal regulation of pigmentation by melanocytes is reviewed. Brief attention is given to genomic and non-genomic variation and impact on the phenotypes expressed and the role of regulatory gene products as potential molecular markers for selection of superior animals. The importance of nutrients in providing substrates for follicular structures and enzymes and in molecules facilitating gene expression is also considered.",

Hair follicle development and growth are regulated by Wnt signalling and depend on interactions between epidermal cells and a population of fibroblasts at the base of the follicle, known as the dermal papilla (DP). DP cells have a distinct gene expression signature from non-DP dermal fibroblasts. However, their origins are largely unknown. By generating chimeric mice and performing skin reconstitution assays we show that, irrespective of whether DP form during development, are induced by epidermal Wnt activation in adult skin or assemble from disaggregated cells, they are polyclonal in origin. While fibroblast proliferation is necessary for hair follicle formation in skin reconstitution assays, mitotically inhibited cells readily contribute to DP. Although new hair follicles do not usually develop in adult skin, adult dermal fibroblasts are competent to contribute to DP during hair follicle neogenesis, irrespective of whether they originate from skin in the resting or growth phase of the hair cycle or skin with beta-catenin-induced ectopic follicles. We propose that during skin reconstitution fibroblasts may be induced to become DP cells by interactions with hair follicle epidermal cells, rather than being derived from a distinct subpopulation of cells.",

Hair follicle morphogenesis requires coordination of multiple signals and communication between its epithelial and mesenchymal constituents. Cell adhesion protein platforms, which include integrins and integrin-linked kinase (ILK), are critical for hair follicle formation. However, their precise contribution to this process is poorly understood. We show that in the absence of ILK, the hair follicle matrix lineage fails to develop, likely due to abnormalities in development of apical-basal cell polarity, as well as in laminin-511 and basement membrane assembly at the tip of the hair bud. These defects also result in impaired specification of hair matrix and absence of precortex and inner sheath root cell lineages. The molecular pathways affected in ILK-deficient follicles are similar to those in the absence of epidermal integrin beta1 and include Wnt, but not sonic hedgehog, signaling. ILK-deficient hair buds also show abnormalities in the dermal papilla. Addition of exogenous laminin-511 restores morphological and molecular markers associated with hair matrix formation, indicating that ILK regulates hair bud cell polarity and functions upstream from laminin-511 assembly to regulate the developmental progression of hair follicles beyond the germ stage.",

Electron microscopic analyses revealed unique ultrastructural features of lanceolate complexes that are proposed to underlie mechanotransduction. Moreover, Schwann cell ablation leads to loss of LTMR terminals at hair follicles while, in contrast, TSCs remain associated with hair follicles following skin denervation in adult mice and, remarkably, become re-associated with newly formed axons, indicating a TSC-dependence of lanceolate complex maintenance and regeneration in adults.

The fact that the follicles that generate these hair types form in successive waves during late embryonic development suggested the model that distinct epigenetic states of the inductive mesenchyme fixed when the follicles are formed specify the distinctive hair morphologies. This model is inconsistent with the observation that many follicles produce different hair types in successive hair cycles. In this study, the characteristics of the hair follicles that switch between the production of different hair types were examined. These follicles were born earlier than those that do not switch between hair types and made longer hairs. They also expressed a higher level of Sox2 in the dermal papilla and had more DP cells per follicle. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that different birthdates specify the potential of different follicles. However, rather than directly specifying hair type, birthdate correlates with three types: guard hairs, a plastic population that can make awl, auchene or zigzag hairs, and a population that normally makes only zigzag hairs.

    "text": "Roles of GasderminA3 in Catagen-Telogen Transition During Hair Cycling. Hair follicles undergo cyclic behavior through regression (catagen), rest (telogen), and regeneration (anagen) during postnatal life. The hair cycle transition is strictly regulated by the autonomous and extrinsic molecular environment. However, whether there is a switch controlling catagen-telogen transition remains largely unknown. Here we show that hair follicles cycle from catagen to the next anagen without transitioning through a morphologically typical telogen after Gsdma3 mutation. This leaves an ESLS (epithelial strand-like structure) during the time period corresponding to telogen phase in WT mice. Molecularly, Wnt10b is upregulated in Gsdma3 mutant mice. Restoration of Gsdma3 expression in AE (alopecia and excoriation) mouse skin rescues hair follicle telogen entry and significantly decreases the Wnt10b-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Overexpression of Wnt10b inhibits telogen entry by increasing epithelial strand cell proliferation. Subsequently, hair follicles with a Gsdma3 mutation enter the second anagen simultaneously as WT mice. Hair follicles cannot enter the second anagen with ectopic WT Gsdma3 overexpression. A luciferase reporter assay proves that Gsdma3 directly suppresses Wnt signaling. Our findings suggest that Gsdma3 has an important role in catagen-telogen transition by balancing the Wnt signaling pathway and that morphologically typical telogen is not essential for the initiation of a new hair cycle.",

However, the role of collagen VI in hair follicle growth is unknown. Here, we show that collagen VI is strongly deposited in hair follicles, and is markedly upregulated by skin wounding. Lack of collagen VI in Col6a1 (-/-) mice delays hair cycling and growth under physiological conditions, but promotes wound-induced hair regrowth without affecting skin regeneration. Conversely, addition of purified collagen VI rescues the abnormal wound-induced hair regrowth in Col6a1 (-/-) mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that the increased wound-induced hair regrowth of Col6a1 (-/-) mice is triggered by activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and is abolished by inhibition of this pathway. These findings highlight the essential relationships between extracellular matrix (ECM) and hair follicle regeneration, and suggest that collagen VI could be a potential therapeutic target for hair loss and other skin-related diseases.",

We generated mice that overexpressed Tbeta4 in the epidermis, as well as Tbeta4 global knockout mice, to study the role of Tbeta4 in HF development and explore the mechanism of Tbeta4 on hair growth. To study Tbeta4 function, we depilated control and experimental mice and made tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). To explore the effect of Tbeta4 on hair growth and HF development, the mRNA and protein levels of Tbeta4 and VEGF were detected by real-time PCR and western blotting in control and experimental mice. Protein expression levels and the phosphorylation of P38, ERK and AKT were also examined by western blotting. The results of depilation indicated that hair re-growth was faster in Tbeta4-overexpressing mice, but slower in knockout mice. Histological examination revealed that Tbeta4-overexpressing mice had a higher number of hair shafts and HFs clustered together to form groups, while the HFs of control mice and knockout mice were separate. Hair shafts in knockout mice were significantly reduced in number compared with control mice. Increased Tbeta4 expression at the mRNA and protein levels was confirmed in Tbeta4-overexpressing mice, which also had increased VEGF expression. On the other hand, knockout mice had reduced levels of VEGF expression. Mechanistically, Tbeta4-overexpressing mice showed increased protein expression levels and phosphorylation of P38, ERK and AKT, whereas knockout mice had decreased levels of both expression and phosphorylation of these proteins. Tbeta4 appears to regulate P38/ERK/AKT signaling via its effect on VEGF expression, with a resultant effect on the speed of hair growth, the pattern of HFs and the number of hair shafts.",

Postpartum effluvium is a well-known clinical fact. However, following some minor research activities in the 1960s, very little has happened on the research front of the subject. It was hypothesized that postpartum hair loss might be a manifestation of a change in the hair growth cycle occurring normally during pregnancy. Recently, new research has been published trying to explain the mechanism of action behind this frequently occurring hair growth disruption, and to develop a functional treatment schedule and regime. Under normal circumstances, postpartum effluvium will disappear by itself as a function of time, and therefore adequate information to the patient is important in order to reduce the anxiety that it will not be a permanent problem. However, in some subjects it can manifest itself for longer stages and even become permanent. At the present time, treatments aim at correcting underlying hormonal imbalances and at improving overall cosmetic appearance. Several treatments in the form of thyroid supplementation, topical progesterone and estradiol lotions, and even oral contraceptive have been studied. All the available studies have significant limitations in their scientific basis, such as small sample size, absence of control group, or highly subjective measurement of treatment response. It is evident from the available studies that no specific treatment has been investigated thoroughly enough to justify recommendation in clinical treatment or to be termed \" \" effective. \" \" Without the ability to provide a pathogenic diagnosis or causality criteria, chances are low that a treatment by trial and error will adequately be able to control hair effluvium.

BACKGROUND: Androgenic alopecia (AGA) occurs as a result of the contraction of the anagen phase because of the action of androgens on hair follicles. TGF-beta production from dermal papillae is enhanced by androgens, and growth inhibition of hair-follicle cells is induced by TGF-beta, and the hair cycle progresses from the anagen phase to the catagen phase. We investigated both the in vitro and in vivo potency of the newly identified ALK5 inhibitor TP0427736 { 6-[4-(4-methyl-1, 3-thiazol-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-5-yl]-1, 3-benzothiazole }. METHODS: For in vitro study, kinase inhibitory activity was evaluated with ELISA, and inhibitory activity against TGF-beta-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation in A549 cells and TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition of human outer root sheath cells were assayed using ELISA. For in vivo study, we used a mouse model that had been synchronized through dorsal hair depilation. RESULTS: TP0427736 inhibited ALK5 kinase activity with an IC50 of 2. 72nM ; this effect was 300-fold higher than the inhibitory effect on ALK3. In cell-based assays, TP0427736 inhibited Smad2/3 phosphorylation in A549 cells and decreased the growth inhibition of human outer root sheath cells. The topical application of TP0427736 significantly decreased Smad2 phosphorylation in mouse skin, and its repeated application suppressed the shortening of average hair follicle length during the transition from the late anagen phase to the catagen phase.

NC cells migrate throughout the embryo and have potential to differentiate into multiple cell types, such as peripheral nerves, glial, cardiac smooth muscle, endocrine, and pigment cells, and craniofacial bone. In the present study, we induced osteoblast-like cells using whisker follicles obtained from the NC of mice. Hair follicle cells derived from the NC labeled with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were collected from protein zero-Cre/floxed-EGFP double transgenic mice and cultured, then treated and cultured in stem cell growth medium. After growth for 14 days, results of flow cytometry analysis showed that 95% of the EGFP-positive (EGFP +) hair follicle cells derived from the NC had proliferated and 76. 2% of those expressed mesenchymal stem cells markers, such as platelet-derived growth factor alpha and stem cell antigen-1, and also showed constitutive expression of Runx2 mRNA. Cells stimulated with bone morphogenetic protein-2 expressed osteocalcin, osterix, and alkaline phosphatase mRNA, resulting in production of mineralized matrices, which were detected by von Kossa and alizarin red staining. Moreover, EGFP + hair follicle cells consistently expressed macrophage colony-stimulating factor and osteoprotegerin (OPG). Addition of 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1, 25 (OH) 2D3] (10-8 M) to the cultures suppressed OPG expression and induced RANKL production in the cells. Furthermore, multinucleated osteoclasts appeared within 6 days after starting co-cultures of bone marrow cells with EGFP + cells in the presence of 1, 25 (OH) 2D3 and PGE2. These results suggest that NC-derived hair follicle cells possess a capacity for osteoblastic differentiation and may be useful for developing new bone regenerative medicine therapies.",

In this study, a comprehensive characterization of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) based on gene expression and enzyme functionality was made in a reconstructed skin epidermal model derived from the outer root sheath (ORS) of hair follicles (ORS-RHE). The ORS-RHE model XME gene profile was consistent with native human skin. Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) consistently reported to be detected in native human skin were also present at the gene level in the ORS-RHE model. The highest Phase I XME gene expression levels were observed for alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases and (carboxyl) esterases. The model was responsive to the CYP inducers, 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and beta-naphthoflavone (betaNF) after topical and systemic applications, evident at the gene and enzyme activity level. Phase II XME levels were generally higher than those of Phase I XMEs, the highest levels were GSTs and transferases, including NAT1. The presence of functional CYPs, UGTs and SULTs was confirmed by incubating the models with 7-ethoxycoumarin, testosterone, benzo (a) pyrene and 3-MC, all of which were rapidly metabolized within 24h after topical application. The extent of metabolism was dependent on saturable and non-saturable metabolism by the XMEs and on the residence time within the model. In conclusion, the ORS-RHE model expresses a number of Phase I and II XMEs, some of which may be induced by AhR ligands. Functional XME activities were also demonstrated using systemic or topical application routes, supporting their use in cutaneous metabolism studies. Such a reproducible model will be of interest when evaluating the cutaneous metabolism and potential toxicity of innovative dermo-cosmetic ingredients.",

BACKGROUND: Hair transplant surgery using follicular unit extraction technique (FUE) is a common surgical procedure for the treatment of severe hair loss. Blood-derived autologous growth factors have also proved to promote hair regeneration in patients with different types of alopecia. AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) technology as an adjuvant therapy for FUE surgery in hair loss affected patients. METHODS: The biologic potential of PRGF was firstly in vitro evaluated over follicular germinal matrix and dermal papilla cells. Afterward, fifteen patients were subjected to routine FUE procedure while 15 patients underwent FUE + PRGF therapy. PRGF group included intradermal injections of growth factors and follicular transfer unit (FTU) preservation in an autologous fibrin clot. Postsurgical patient satisfaction and clinical improvement were evaluated, and PRGF or saline-preserved hair grafts were histomorphometrically analyzed. RESULTS: Follicular cell proliferation and migration was induced after autologous growth factors treatment. PRGF-preserved FTUs presented higher bioactivity signals and improved integrity of perifollicular structures and extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and elastic fibers. PRGF not only reduced the postsurgical crust healing and hair fixation period, but also decreased the inflammatory pain and itching sensation. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary data demonstrate that PRGF is able to minimize the postsurgical follicle loss and potentiate the performance of grafted hairs. The fibrin clot not only acts as a protective barrier against environmental factors, but also provides a biologically active scaffold that induces resident cell proliferation and maintains an optimal integrity of the grafted hair.",

BACKGROUND: Houttuynia cordata Thunb (HC) is a traditional herbal medicine widely used in Asia for the treatment of patients with alopecia, usually in combination with other two herbal medicines (Perilla frutescens var. acuta (PFVA) and green tea (GT)). However, the effect of this herbal complex has not been clearly demonstrated. We sought to determine the hair growth-promoting effect of this herbal complex (HC, PFVA, and GT) in the animal model. METHODS: Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into four groups (negative control, finasteride (1 mg/kg) as a positive control, and two (200 and 400 mg/kg) concentrations of the herbal complex as experimental groups) and were fed its corresponding medications orally for 25 days. Hair growth was evaluated visually and microscopically. Western blot analysis for insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 was performed. RESULTS: The herbal complex exhibited hair growth-promoting activity in C57BL/6 mice. Grossly, the area of hair regrowth was 55. 1 (+-3. 8)%, 70. 2 (+-6. 3)% and 83. 5 (+-5. 7)% in negative control, herbal complex 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg group, respectively. In histologic examination, the hair follicle count in deep subcutis was 2. 6 (+-0. 7), 5. 8 (+-0. 7) and 8. 6 (+-1. 2) and the diameter of hair follicles was 11. 9 (+-5. 0) mum, 17. 4 (+-3. 9) mum and 22. 8 (+-5. 2) mum in negative control, herbal complex 200 and 400 mg/kg group, respectively. The expression of IGF-1 was 0. 14 (+-0. 01), 0. 23 (+-0. 02) and 0. 24 (+-0. 01) and the expression of TGF-beta1 was 0. 26 (+-0. 01), 0. 19 (+-0. 02) and 0. 15 (+-0. 01) in negative control, the 200 and 400 mg/kg group, respectively.

    "text": "Minoxidil Promotes Hair Growth through Stimulation of Growth Factor Release from Adipose-Derived Stem Cells. Minoxidil directly promotes hair growth via the stimulation of dermal papilla (DP) and epithelial cells. Alternatively, there is little evidence for indirect promotion of hair growth via stimulation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). We investigated whether minoxidil stimulates ASCs and if increased growth factor secretion by ASCs facilitates minoxidil-induced hair growth. Telogen-to-anagen induction was examined in mice. Cultured DP cells and vibrissae hair follicle organ cultures were used to further examine the underlying mechanisms. Subcutaneous injection of minoxidil-treated ASCs accelerated telogen-to-anagen transition in mice, and increased hair weight at day 14 post-injection. Minoxidil did not alter ASC proliferation, but increased migration and tube formation. Minoxidil also increased the secretion of growth factors from ASCs, including chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), and platelet-derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C). Minoxidil increased extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, and concomitant upregulation of PD-ECGF and PDGF-C mRNA levels were attenuated by an ERK inhibitor. Subcutaneous injection of CXCL1, PD-ECGF, or PDGF-C enhanced anagen induction in mice, and both CXCL1 and PDGF-C increased hair length in ex vivo organ culture. Treatment with CXCL1, PD-ECGF, or PDGF-C also increased the proliferation index in DP cells. Finally, topical application of CXCL1, PD-ECGF, or PDGF-C with 2% minoxidil enhanced anagen induction when compared to minoxidil alone. Minoxidil stimulates ASC motility and increases paracrine growth factor signaling. Minoxidil-stimulated secretion of growth factors by ASCs may enhance hair growth by promoting DP proliferation. Therefore, minoxidil can be used as an ASC preconditioning agent for hair regeneration.",

The eyelash morphology, pigmentation and growth rate have been documented using techniques ranging from lash imaging to follicle immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that the lash follicle is sensitive to many factors of the external environment, a variety of systemic/topical medications and cosmetics. Recently, aerodynamic studies using a mammalian eye model confirmed that an optimal lash length was needed so that eyelashes serve a protective role in reducing the number of particles that can reach the eye. Despite recent advances in lash research, studies are still scarce, due to the limited availability of the human lid for sampling.

Full-thickness skin injury affects millions of people worldwide each year. It often leads to scar formation and loss of skin appendages even after clinical treatment. The majority of wound dressings currently used cannot achieve scarless skin regeneration with complete recovery of appendages such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Functional regeneration of these skin appendages is a great challenge. However, we achieved this goal by the successful development and utilization of a photo-crosslinkable sericin hydrogel (SMH) as a new type of wound dressing for repairing full-thickness skin injury. SMH implanted in a mouse full-thickness skin injury model promoted scarless wound healing with effective regeneration of hair follicles and sebaceous glands. By employing techniques of molecular biology, biochemistry, and in vivo cell tracing, we revealed the underlying repair mechanisms: SMH inhibited inflammation, stimulated angiogenesis during healing process, prevented scar tissue formation via regulating the expressions of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, and recruited mesenchymal stem cells to injury sites for regeneration of skin appendages. Collectively, in this study, we developed a sericin-based hydrogel as a wound dressing for full-thickness skin injury repair, uncovered the functional roles of sericin hydrogels in promoting scarless skin regeneration along with effective recovery of skin appendages, and thus unveiled sericin ' s potential for skin wound healing.",

    "text": "How chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage the tissue: Comparative biology lessons from feather and hair models. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are common modalities for cancer treatment. While targeting rapidly growing cancer cells, they also damage normal tissues and cause adverse effects. From the initial insult such as DNA double-strand break, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a general stress response, there are complex regulatory mechanisms that control the actual tissue damage process. Besides apoptosis, a range of outcomes for the damaged cells are possible including cell cycle arrest, senescence, mitotic catastrophe, and inflammatory responses and fibrosis at the tissue level. Feather and hair are among the most actively proliferating (mini-) organs and are highly susceptible to both chemotherapy and radiotherapy damage, thus provide excellent, experimentally tractable model systems for dissecting how normal tissues respond to such injuries. Taking a comparative biology approach to investigate this has turned out to be particularly productive. Started in chicken feather and then extended to murine hair follicles, it was revealed that in addition to p53-mediated apoptosis, several other previously overlooked mechanisms are involved. Specifically, Shh, Wnt, mTOR, cytokine signalling and ROS-mediated degradation of adherens junctions have been implicated in the damage and/or reparative regeneration process. Moreover, we show here that inflammatory responses, which can be prominent upon histological examination of chemo-or radiotherapy-damaged hair follicle, may not be essential for the hair loss phenotype. These studies point to fundamental, evolutionarily conserved mechanisms in controlling tissue responses in vivo, and suggest novel strategies for the prevention and management of adverse effects that arise from chemo-or radiotherapy.",

Spatially, long-range interactions between HFs and dWAT involve the exchange of extracellular vesicles which are differentially released by precursors, preadipocytes, and mature adipocytes. Different exogenous factors, including light irradiation, are likely to modify the release of adipocyte-derived exosomes in dWAT, which can lead to aberrations of the HF cycle.

    "text": "\" Wanted, dead and alive: Why a multidisciplinary approach is needed to unlock hair treatment potential. Human recorded history is littered with attempts to improve the perceived appearance of scalp hair. Throughout history, treatments have included both biological and chemical interventions. Hair \" \" quality \" \" or \" \" perceived appearance \" \" is regulated by multiple biological intervention opportunities: adding more hairs by flipping follicles from telogen to anagen, or delaying anagen follicles transiting into catagen ; altering hair \" \" apparent amount \" \" by modulating shaft diameter or shape ; or, in principle, altering shaft physical properties changing its synthesis. By far the most common biological intervention strategy today is to increase the number of hairs, but to date this has proven difficult and has yielded minimal benefits. Chemical intervention primarily consists of active material surface deposition to improve shaft shine, fibre-fibre interactions and strength. Real, perceptible benefits will best be achieved by combining opportunity areas across the three primary sciences: biology, chemistry and physics. Shaft biogenesis begins with biology: proliferation in the germinative matrix, then crossing \" \" Auber ' s Critical Line \" \" and ceasing proliferation to synthesize shaft components. Biogenesis then shifts to oxidative chemistry, where previously synthesized components are organized and cross-linked into a shaft. We herein term the crossing point from biology to chemistry as \" \" The Orwin Threshold. \" \" Historically, hair biology and chemistry have been conducted in different fields, with biological manipulation residing in biomedical communities and hair shaft chemistry and physics within the consumer care industry, with minimal cross-fertilization. Detailed understanding of hair shaft biogenesis should enable identification of factors necessary for optimum hair shaft production and new intervention opportunities. \"",

    "text": "\" Morphological Changes of Human Hair Related to \" \" Graying \" \". The appearance of hair is a crucial factor of human well-being. Besides hair color and shine, the dynamic movement characteristics have a great impact on a youthful look, which is desirable at all ages. However, the hair follicle is subject to biochemical changes which tend to become obvious in the mid-30s by the appearance of the first nonpigmented \" \" gray \" \" hairs. Especially, these fibers seem to be unruly, hereby influencing the hair collective. In this investigation, the complex dynamic movement of swinging hair is modeled by an in vitro method. Using pigmented and nonpigmented hair strands, the results are related to the morphological and mechanical changes associated with the process of ageing. Furthermore, the in vitro method is extended toward a real life setting by monitoring the movement of women ' s ponytails with different fractions of gray hair, while walking on a treadmill. The dynamic movement of hair is a complex phenomenon, which can be affected by several factors: the internal structure, thickness and waviness of single hair fibers, the fiber-fiber interactions, and the shape and volume of hair collectives. As these properties change with age, they are expected to lead to differences in the dynamic hair movement. Using the in vitro method, the dynamic hair movement of pigmented and nonpigmented hair strands is quantified. A harmonic bending oscillation of a hair collective is induced by rotational excitation at the upper strand end, which allows the analysis of the driven as well as the free oscillation mode. The maximum swing height of the hair collective, characterized by the parameter \" \" relative amplitude, \" \" is measured during the driven oscillation and correlates with the deflection of the hair collective. Compared with pigmented hair, the relative amplitude is significantly lower for nonpigmented hair strands. This indicates a stronger damping, i. e., energy loss, for the nonpigmented hair strands, which relates to higher waviness and larger hair collective volume. In addition, the larger diameter of the nonpigmented hair fibers leads to a higher contribution of these fibers to the collective ' s bending stiffness. Furthermore, the natural frequency during the free oscillation stage of the measurement is significantly lower for partly nonpigmented hair strands. The damping of hair collectives expressed by the logarithmic decrement is, in turn, significantly higher for nonpigmented hair strands. This is attributed to increased fiber-fiber interactions and higher frictional forces within the strand and to increased air resistance. With the laboratory test (in vitro method), the oscillation of different hair qualities using hair strands with defined weights and lengths can be analyzed, providing the practical and theoretical concepts to determine the hair movement in a realistic setting. This enables the measurement of the ponytail movement for women walking on a treadmill. Like the in vitro method, the in vivo method allows the analysis of the driven and the free oscillation mode. It is shown that the results of both methods demonstrate a high degree of correspondence. Ponytails with > = 5% nonpigmented hair fibers have a significantly lower relative amplitude and a significantly higher damping performance in comparison with ponytails with no or less than 5% nonpigmented hair fibers. This highlights the importance of even small fractions of \" \" gray \" \" hair for the dynamic movement and, as such, the appearance and perception of hair collectives. \"",

Signaling from mesenchymal stem cells and platelet derived growth factors positively influences hair growth through cellular proliferation to prolong the anagen phase (FGF-7), inducing cell growth (ERK activation), stimulating hair follicle development (beta-catenin), and suppressing apoptotic cues (Bcl-2 release and Akt activation).",

Several types of mechanoreceptors have been identified anatomically in rodent whisker hair follicles, but their functional properties have not been fully studied. Here we developed a pressure-clamped single-fiber recording technique to record impulses on mouse whisker hair follicle afferent nerves following displacements of whisker hair follicles. On the basis of the patterns of impulses evoked by the mechanical stimulation, three functional types of mechanoreceptors were identified, including rapidly adapting (RA), slowly adapting type 1 (SA1), and slowly adapting type 2 (SA2) mechanoreceptors. Impulses of all these mechanoreceptors were almost completely abolished by 30 nM TTX, and were largely suppressed by cooling temperatures at 15 C. Tested at different displacement distances as different stimulation intensity, RA mechanoreceptors showed a limited capacity for stimulation intensity encoding, but both SA1 and SA2 mechanoreceptors displayed linear increases of impulse numbers with increased stimulation intensity. Tested with different ramp speed of displacements, RA impulses were only evoked by rapid ramp stimulation but SA1 and SA2 impulses could be evoked by both rapid and slow ramp stimulation. Tested with different stimulation frequency, all three types of mechanoreceptors well followed the stimulation at 10-100 Hz. Taken together, this study revealed some important functional properties of RA, SA1 and SA2 mechanoreceptors, which helps better understand the encoding of tactile information by different types of low-threshold mechanoreceptors.",

Poly-gamma-glutamic acid (gamma-PGA)-based nanoparticles draw remarkable attention as drug delivery agents due to their controlled release characteristics, low toxicity, and biocompatibility. 4HGF is an herbal mixture of Phellinus linteus grown on germinated brown rice, Cordyceps militaris grown on germinated soybeans, Polygonum multiflorum, Ficus carica, and Cocos nucifera oil. Here, we encapsulated 4HGF within PGA-based hydrogel nanoparticles, prepared by simple ionic gelation with chitosan, to facilitate its penetration into hair follicles (HFs). In this study, we report the hair promoting activity of 4HGF encapsulated with PGA nanoparticles (PGA-4HGF) and their mechanism, compared to 4HGF alone. The average size of spherical nanoparticles was ~ 400 nm in diameter. Continuous release of PGA-4HGF was observed in a simulated physiological condition. As expected, PGA-4HGF treatment increased hair length, induced earlier anagen initiation, and elongated the duration of the anagen phase in C57BL/6N mice, compared with free 4HGF treatment. PGA-4HGF significantly increased dermal papilla cell proliferation and induced cell cycle progression. PGA-4HGF also significantly increased the total amount of beta-catenin protein expression, a stimulator of the anagen phase, through induction of cyclinD1 and CDK4 protein levels, compared to free 4HGF treatment. Our findings underscore the potential of PGA nanocapsules to efficiently deliver 4HGF into HFs, hence promoting hair-growth. Therefore, PGA-4HGF nanoparticles may be promising therapeutic agents for hair growth disorders.",

Not only does cold atmospheric pressure plasma provide a therapeutic opportunity to control redox-based processes, it is also an innovative method in rejuvenation. Given the current interest in new methods of rejuvenation, we aimed to introduce a novel pulsed nitrogen plasma torch with potential use in rejuvenation. We investigated production of reactive species at different pulse energy by spectroscopy and also measured nitric oxide and O2 concentration and evaluated the flame temperature. Fifteen Wistar rats were divided into three groups based on the applied energy settings ; the skin of the animals was processed with plasma. For quantitative evaluation of dermis, epidermis and hair follicles (to confirm the effects of this technique on rejuvenation), skin biopsies were taken from both unexposed and treated areas. The spectroscopy results showed the presence of nitric oxide in plasma and the concentration was suitable for dermatological applications. A significant increase was observed in epidermal thickness, fibroblast cell proliferation and collagenesis (P < 0. 05). Interestingly, plasma led to a temporary increase in the diameter of primary and secondary hair follicles compared to the controls. The results confirmed the positive effects of this pulsed nitrogen plasma torch on rejuvenation and also revealed a new possible aspect of cold plasma ; its effect on hair follicles as a promising area in the treatment of alopecia that requires further clinical and molecular studies.",

BACKGROUND: Few effective treatments are available for male pattern hair loss (MPHL) or, especially, for female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Recently, cell-based therapies using autologous or allogeneic cells have been used clinically. OBJECTIVE: We examined the safety and efficacy of autologous cell-based therapy using dermal sheath cup (DSC) cells to treat MPHL and FPHL. METHODS: DSCs dissected from occipital hair follicles were cultured to manufacture DSC cells. Participants with MPHL or FPHL received single injections of 7. 5 x 106, 1. 5 x 106, or 3. 0 x 105 DSC cells or a placebo in 4 randomized separate regions on the scalp, and hair densities and diameters were measured for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. RESULTS: Fifty men and 15 women aged 33 to 64 years were injected with DSC cells. Total hair density and cumulative hair diameter at the 3. 0 x 105 DSC cells injection site was significantly increased compared with the placebo after 6 and 9 months. Men and women showed similar improvements, and there were no serious adverse events. LIMITATIONS: No lower cell numbers were tested, and the positive effect was temporary until 9 months.

Ultrasound (US) has been found to rejuvenate and invigorate the hair follicles, increase the size of hair shafts, and promote new hair growth. Our present study found that dual-frequency US-mediated microbubble (MB) cavitation significantly enhanced minoxidil (Mx) delivery in both in vitro and in vivo models, while increasing the hair growth efficacy compared to single-frequency US sonication. The in vitro experiments showed that cavitation activity was enhanced more significantly during dual-frequency sonication than single-frequency sonication in higher concentration of MBs. The pigskin penetration depth in the group in which dual-frequency US was combined with MBs was 1. 54 and 2. 86 times greater than for single-frequency US combined with MBs and in the control group, respectively ; the corresponding increases in the release rate of Mx at 18 hours in in vitro Franz-diffusion-cell experiments were 24. 9% and 43. 7%. During 21 days of treatment in C57BL/6J mice experiments, the growth rate at day 11 in the group in which dual-frequency US was combined with MBs increased by 2. 07 times compared to single-frequency US combined with MBs. These results indicate that dual-frequency US-mediated MB cavitation can significantly increase both skin permeability and transdermal drug delivery.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to characterize and detect the possible differences among the hair of three different ethnicities: African, Asiatic and Caucasian. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The differences in water adsorption/desorption behaviour of hairs were studied using a thermogravimetric balance and compared with the analysis of the lipid distribution and order using synchrotron-based Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy. Besides, the thermal thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses on human hair were executed. RESULTS: Differences in the diffusion coefficients were evidenced. African hair exhibited increased permeability. Caucasian hair displayed a higher water absorption capability with increasing humidity but with a slow diffusion rate. The Asian fibre appeared to be more resistant to hydration changes. The spectroscopic analysis showed notable differences in the cuticle lipids. The African cuticle exhibited more lipids with a lower order bilayer. The outmost layer of Caucasian fibres contained more ordered lipids, and the Asian fibres show a very low level of lipids on the cuticle region. The DSC results indicate no difference in the thermal stability and TG showed higher water content in the Caucasian fibre and a possible lower cysteine disulphide bond content in the African hair matrix. CONCLUSION: The triple approach demonstrated the permeability differences among the ethnic fibres and their correlation with the properties of their cuticle lipids. These differences could have particular relevance to the hair care cosmetic market.",

We investigated the effect of oxygen tension on the proliferation and hair-inductive capacity of human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) and dermal sheath cells (DSCs). DPCs and DSCs were separately obtained from human hair follicles and each cultured under atmospheric/hyperoxic (20% O2), physiological/normoxic (6% O2), or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions. Proliferation of DPCs and DSCs was highest under normoxia. Compared with hyperoxia, hypoxia inhibited proliferation of DPCs, but enhanced that of DSCs. In DPCs, hypoxia downregulated the expression of hair-inductive capacity-related genes, including BMP4, LEF1, SOX2, and VCAN. In DSCs, both normoxia and hypoxia upregulated SOX2 expression, whereas hypoxia downregulated BMP4 expression. Microarray analysis revealed that normoxia increased the expression of pluripotency-related genes, including SPRY, NR0B1, MSX2, IFITM1, and DAZL, compared with hyperoxia. In an in vivo hair follicle reconstitution assay, cultured DPCs and DSCs were transplanted with newborn mouse epidermal keratinocytes into nude mice using a chamber method. In this experiment, normoxia resulted in the most efficient induction of DPC hair follicles, whereas hypoxia caused the most efficient induction and maturation of DSC hair follicles. These results suggest that application of physiological/hypoxic oxygen tension to cultured human DSCs enhances proliferation and maintenance of hair inductivity for skin engineering and clinical applications. Impact statement Dermal sheath cells (DSCs) and dermal papilla cells (DPCs) are useful cell sources for cell-based regenerative therapy. This is the first report to describe that low-oxygen conditions are better for DSCs. Normoxic and hypoxic culture of DSCs is beneficial for expanding these hair follicular cells and advancing development of cell-based therapy for both wound healing and hair regeneration.

There is no reported information about the role of miRNAs in hair epithelial cells of AGA. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the roles of miRNAs affecting AGA in normal and patient ' s epithelial hair cells. METHODS: Normal follicular stem and progenitor cells, as well as follicular patient ' s stem cells, were sorted from hair follicles, and a miRNA q-PCR profiling to compare the expression of 748 miRNA (miRs) in sorted cells were performed. Further, we examined the putative functional implication of the most differentially regulated miRNA (miR-324-3p) in differentiation, proliferation and migration of cultured keratinocytes by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and scratch assay. To explore the mechanisms underlying the effects of miR-324-3p, we used specific chemical inhibitors targeting pathways influenced by miR-324-3p. RESULT: We provide a comprehensive assessment of the \" \" miRNome \" \" of normal and AGA follicular stem and progenitor cells. Differentially regulated miRNA signatures highlight several miRNA candidates including miRNA-324-3p as mis regulated in patient ' s stem cells. We find that miR-324-3p promotes differentiation and migration of cultured keratinocytes likely through the regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of the TGF-beta signaling pathway using Alk5i promotes hair shaft elongation in an organ-culture system. CONCLUSION: Together, we offer a platform for understanding miRNA dynamic regulation in follicular stem and progenitor cells in baldness and highlight miR-324-3p as a promising target for its treatment. \"",

Nearly all mammals have a vibrissal system specialized for tactile sensation, composed of whiskers growing from sensor-rich follicles in the skin. When a whisker deflects against an object, it deforms within the follicle and exerts forces on the mechanoreceptors inside. In addition, during active whisking behavior, muscle contractions around the follicle and increases in blood pressure in the ring sinus will affect the whisker deformation profile. To date, however, it is not yet possible to experimentally measure how the whisker deforms in an intact follicle or its effects on different groups of mechanoreceptors. The present study develops a novel model to predict vibrissal deformation within the follicle sinus complex. The model is based on experimental results from a previous ex vivo study on whisker deformation within the follicle, and on a new histological analysis of follicle tissue. It is then used to simulate whisker deformation within the follicle during passive touch and active whisking. Results suggest that the most likely whisker deformation profile is \" \" S-shaped, \" \" crossing the midline of the follicle right below the ring sinus. Simulations of active whisking indicate that an increase in overall muscle stiffness, an increase in the ratio between deep and superficial intrinsic muscle stiffness, and an increase in sinus blood pressure will all enhance tactile sensitivity. Finally, we discuss how the deformation profiles might map to the responses of primary afferents of each mechanoreceptor type. The mechanical model presented in this study is an important first step in simulating mechanical interactions within whisker follicles. \"",

The hair follicle dermal papilla is critical for hair generation and de novo regeneration. When cultured in vitro, dermal papilla cells from different species demonstrate two distinguishable growth patterns under the conventional culture condition: a self-aggregative three dimensional spheroidal (3D) cell pattern and a two dimensional (2D) monolayer cell pattern, correlating with different hair inducing properties. Whether the loss of self-aggregative behavior relates to species-specific differences or the improper culture condition remains unclear. Can the fixed 2D patterned dermal papilla cells recover the self-aggregative behavior and 3D pattern also remains undetected. Here, we successfully constructed the two growth patterns using sika deer (Cervus nippon) dermal papilla cells and proved it was the culture condition that determined the dermal papilla growth pattern. The two growth patterns could transit mutually as the culture condition was exchanged. The fixed 2D patterned sika deer dermal papilla cells could recover the self-aggregative behavior and transit back to 3D pattern, accompanied by the restoration of hair inducing capability when the culture condition was changed. In addition, the global gene expressions during the transition from 2D pattern to 3D pattern were compared to detect the potential regulating genes and pathways involved in the recovery of 3D pattern and hair inducing capability.",

Genodermatoses, such as heritable skin disorders, mostly represent Mendelian conditions. Congenital hypotrichosis (HY) characterize a condition of being born with less hair than normal. The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinicopathological phenotype of a breed-specific non-syndromic form of HY in Hereford cattle and to identify the causative genetic variant for this recessive disorder. Affected calves showed a very short, fine, wooly, kinky and curly coat over all parts of the body, with a major expression in the ears, the inner part of the limbs, and in the thoracic-abdominal region. Histopathology showed a severely altered morphology of the inner root sheath (IRS) of the hair follicle with abnormal Huxley and Henle ' s layers and severely dysplastic hair shafts. A genome-wide association study revealed an association signal on chromosome 5. Homozygosity mapping in a subset of cases refined the HY locus to a 690 kb critical interval encompassing a cluster of type II keratin encoding genes. Protein-coding exons of six positional candidate genes with known hair or hair follicle function were re-sequenced. This revealed a protein-changing variant in the KRT71 gene that encodes a type II keratin specifically expressed in the IRS of the hair follicle (c. 281delTGTGCCCA ; p. Met94AsnfsX14). Besides obvious phenocopies, a perfect concordance between the presence of this most likely pathogenic loss-of-function variant located in the head domain of KRT71 and the HY phenotype was found. This recessive KRT71-related form of hypotrichosis provides a novel large animal model for similar human conditions. The results have been incorporated in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals (OMIA) database (OMIA 002114-9913).",

BACKGROUND: Vitamin D, a vitamin and hormone, plays an important role in dermatology and dermatotherapeutics, due to its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, and regulation of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation. It also affects the hair cycle, and its role in hair loss is under constant research. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to give a brief overview of vitamin D biology within the hair follicle, role in the etiopathogenesis, and rationale for supplementation in various alopecias. METHODS: A PubMed literature search was performed to review relevant current literature and studies investigating the role of vitamin D in the etiopathogenesis, as a supplement and a potential therapeutic modality in hair loss. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Vitamin D is intricately involved in various signaling pathways of growth and differentiation of hair follicles. Most studies show an inverse relationship between serum vitamin D levels and non-scarring alopecias such as telogen effluvium, androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, and trichotillomania. Vitamin D deficiency is also associated with scarring alopecia. However, conclusive studies to demonstrate the benefit of vitamin D administration in correcting hair loss and managing these conditions are lacking. Hence, further studies are needed before vitamin D can be routinely recommended as a treatment modality in these conditions.",

Stem cells in different types may interact with each other to maintain homeostasis or growth and the interactions are complicated and extensive. There is increasing evidence that mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in early morphogenesis stages of both tooth and hair follicles show many similarities. In order to explore whether stem cells from one tissue could interact with cells from another tissue, a series of experiments were carried out. Here we successfully extracted and identified stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) of 8-12 years old kids, and then found that SHED could promote hair regeneration in a mouse model. In vitro, SHED shortened the hair regeneration cycle and promoted the proliferation and aggregation of dermal cells. In vivo, when SHED and skin cells of C57 mice were subcutaneously co-transplanted to nude mice, more hair was formed than skin cells without SHED. To further explore the molecular mechanism, epidermal and dermal cells were freshly extracted and co-cultured with SHED. Then several signaling molecules in hair follicle regeneration were detected and we found that the expression of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and Glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) was up-regulated. It seems that SHED may boost the prosperity of hairs by increase Shh/Gli1 pathway, which brings new perspectives in tissue engineering and damaged tissue repairing.",

Hair density measurement (HDM) is a process used for detecting the severity of hair loss by counting the number of hairs present in the occipital donor region for transplantation. HDM is a typical object detection and classification problem that could benefit from deep learning. This study analyzed the accuracy of HDM by applying deep learning technology for object detection and reports the feasibility of automating HDM. The dataset for training and evaluation comprised 4492 enlarged hair scalp RGB images obtained from male hair-loss patients and the corresponding annotation data that contained the location information of the hair follicles present in the image and follicle-type information according to the number of hairs.

BACKGROUND: Rice bran extracts (RB) derived from Oryza sativa are part of cultural skin and hair care practices in Asia. Given the knowledge gap regarding clinical efficacy, marketplace availability, and safety, the growing popularity of nutraceuticals calls for better clinician awareness and scientific understanding of their applications and limitations. OBJECTIVE: To review available scientific evidence regarding therapeutic efficacy, safety, and consumer availability of RB on hair health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A primary literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify articles on RB and hair growth in May 2021. A limited market analysis of rice-derivative-containing hair products was also conducted on Amazon. com. RESULTS: 10 studies were analyzed: six regarding the efficacy of RB for hair growth, and four analyzing the safety profile of RB. Topically applied RB increases expression of growth factors and molecular signals which promote cell proliferation in the anagen phase including & beta ;-catenin, while inhibiting enzymes responsible for propagating anagen to catagen/telogen transition including TGF & beta ; and Type I 5 & alpha ;-reductase. RB is non-genotoxic, non-cytotoxic, and appropriate for human use in cosmetics. The Amazon. com search yielded 119 rice-containing hair products, reflecting their over-the-counter popularity. CONCLUSIONS: Current literature is promising for RB promoting hair growth given its ability to increase expression of growth factors and molecular signals associated with maintaining anagen phase, decreasing inflammation, inhibiting 5 & alpha ;-reductase, and promoting melanogenesis.

Dermal papilla (DP) cells regulate hair follicle epithelial cells and melanocytes by secreting functional factors, playing a key role in hair follicle morphogenesis and hair growth. DP cells can reconstitute new hair follicles and induce hair regeneration, providing a potential therapeutic strategy for treating hair loss. However, current methods for isolating DP cells are either inefficient (physical microdissection) or only applied to genetically labeled mice. We systematically screened for the surface proteins specifically expressed in skin DP using mRNA expression databases. We identified two antibodies against receptors LEPR and SCARA5 which could specifically label and isolate DP cells by flow cytometry from mice back skin at the growth phase. The sorted LEPR + cells maintained the DP characteristics after culturing in vitro, expressing DP marker alkaline phosphatase and functional factors including RSPO1/2 and EDN3, the three major DP secretory factors that regulate hair follicle epithelial cells and melanocytes. Furthermore, the low-passage LEPR + DP cells could reconstitute hair follicles on nude mice using chamber graft assay when combined with epithelial stem cells.

Prospective analysis of 271 male patients with androgenic alopecia who underwent hair transplantation with FUE technique between August 2015 and February 2020 at our center was conducted. The mean age was 35. 93 +-4. 40 years. At one year postoperatively, patients were asked to fill up a questionnaire which included their satisfaction level, need for 2nd session, and complications. Informed written consent was obtained from all patients. Also, blood samples were provided from patients before the operation. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed using the RNX-Plus kit (Cinnagen, Iran) and Vivantis kit (Malaysia). Amplification of SRD5A2 and GAPDH genes (as internal standard) for measuring gene expression was performed by real-time PCR. Data were analyzed using the statistical package for social science SPSS V. 23. In the last 156 cases, the addition of 40 mg of Triamcinolone to the LA solution led to a dramatic reduction of the incidence of postoperative oedema, from 40% to 9%.

The addition of 40 mg Triamcinolone to the LA solution was highly effective in reducing postoperative oedema. Three sessions of PRP at 2nd, 4th and 6th months postoperatively were recommended. The results of SRD5A2 gene expression showed that the expression of this gene in satisfied (P = 0. 049) and dissatisfied (P = 0. 028) patients were significantly higher than highly satisfied patients, which means that the SRD5A2 gene expression had an essential role in the successfulness of hair transplantation.

There is genetic diversity of hair types in Inner Mongolia cashmere goat population. Previous studies have found that fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and PI3K-AKT signal pathways may be related to different hair types in Inner Mongolia cashmere goats. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the effects of PI3K-AKT signal pathway on different hair types, the expression of mRNA and protein expression sites of FGF21 in the hair follicles of cashmere goats with different hair types, so as to lay a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanism of different hair types and the role of skin hair follicle development. In this experiment, the skin tissues of long hair type (LHG) and short hair type (SHG) of Inner Mongolia cashmere goat were collected in three key periods of secondary hair follicle growth, namely, anagen (September), catagen (December) and telogen (March). The relative expression of FGF21 and PI3K-AKT signal pathway candidate gene mRNA in different periods and different hair types was detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative technique (qRT-PCR), and the expression site of FGF21 protein was located by immunohistochemical technique. Through qRT-PCR, it was found that the relative expression of FGF21, FGFR1, AKT3, BRCA1, PKN3, SPP1 and GNG4 was significantly different between LHG and SHG. The expression of FGF21 in the skin of LHG was significantly higher than that of SHG in the three periods. Through immunohistochemical test, it was found that FGF21 protein was mainly expressed in primary hair follicle connective tissue sheath, primary hair follicle outer root sheath, secondary hair follicle outer root sheath and sebaceous glands. It was also found that the expression of LHG skin tissue in the outer root sheath of primary hair follicles was higher than that of SHG in three periods. In summary, it is suggested that PI3K-AKT signal pathway may play an important role in the formation of different hair types in Inner Mongolia cashmere goats.",

Alopecia areata is a common disfiguring hair loss disorder that primarily affects the hair follicle as it enters the prolonged growth phase called anagen. The last few years have yielded an explosion of more rigorously obtained data on the etiology and pathogenesis of this disorder. While a consensus is rapidly building in support of an autoimmune pathogenesis, there are still several enigmatic issues to be resolved. These include the possibility that alopecia areata is really a multientity disorder with causes that are multifactorial. This will have important implications for the research scientist ' s search for the jigsaw puzzle ' s largest missing piece--the identification of the target autoantigen (s). There is now much evidence that autoimmune diseases with both T and B cell components have shared target autoantigens/epitopes. It is likely that alopecia areata is similar, as there is now very strong evidence for the generation of autoantibodies as well as autoreactive T cells to hair follicles in the pathogenesis of this disease. The following brief review outlines the progress we have made over the last five to ten years in the characterization of hair follicle antigens targeted by antibodies in alopecia areata. Results of these studies now show that the elicitation of antibodies to hair follicle-specific proteins is a highly conserved phenomenon in all affected species studied to date. Candidate autoantigens that have been identified include the 44/46 kDa hair-specific keratin (expressed in the precortical zone of anagen hair follicles) and trichohyalin (an important intermediate filament-associated protein) expressed in the inner root sheath of the growing hair follicle. Moreover, there is evidence that anti-hair follicle antibodies are modulated during the disease process, can occur before clinically detectable hair loss, and may be reduced in titer during successful treatment. Preliminary data from passive transfer experiments suggest that in some species these antibodies may disrupt hair cycling. We are currently applying a more molecular approach (e. g., cDNA library screening) to identify hair follicle antigens truly associated with the onset of the disorder.",

A specific subset of hair follicular keratinocytes in mouse skin expresses thymosin beta4 in a highly coordinated manner during the hair growth cycle. These keratinocytes originate in the hair follicle bulge region, a niche for skin stem cells. Rat vibrissa follicle clonogenic keratinocytes, closely related, if not identical, to the bulge-residing stem cells, were isolated and their migration and differentiation increased in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of thymosin beta4. Expression and secretion of the extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-2 were increased by thymosin beta4. Thus, thymosin beta4 accelerates hair growth, in part, due to its effect on critical events in the active phase of the hair follicle cycle, including promoting the migration of stem cells and their immediate progeny to the base of the follicle, differentiation, and extracellular matrix remodeling.",

    "text": "Gap junction development in the human fetal hair follicle and bulge region. BACKGROUND: Gap junctions, composed of connexin (Cx) subunits, are channels that allow intercellular communication between adjacent cells and are thought to play a key role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The Cx expression pattern and formation of gap junctions in human fetal hair follicles has yet to be clarified, including the prominent follicular bulge region that is believed to be a site rich in stem cells. OBJECTIVES: To study the expression of two major Cxs, Cx26 and Cx43, in developing hair follicles in skin samples from a series of human fetuses of estimated gestational age (EGA) 88-163 days, and to determine quantitatively the presence of gap junctions. METHODS: We used immunofluorescence labelling to investigate the sequential expression pattern of Cx26 and Cx43 in developing human hair follicles. Gap junction formation was observed by electron microscopy and the numbers of gap junctions were analysed quantitatively. Results Both Cx26 and Cx43 expression were observed at 88 days ' EGA in the inner part of the hair peg. At 135 days ' EGA, Cx26 was expressed in the outer root sheath (ORS) and the inner root sheath (IRS), while Cx43 was expressed chiefly in the IRS, hair matrix and sebaceous glands. At 163 days ' EGA, Cx26 expression was most intense in the outermost layer of the ORS, in contrast to Cx43 expression which was in the inner part of the ORS. In the bulge region, only Cx43 was expressed in a subset of cells in the bulge. Ultrastructurally, gap junctions were observed at 102 days ' EGA in the hair peg, and the number of gap junctions increased as the hair follicle matured. Gap junctions were also observed between the bulge cells in considerable numbers. CONCLUSIONS: The changing expression patterns of Cx26 and Cx43 and the increasing gap junction numbers suggest a close association of Cx expression and gap junction formation with hair follicle morphogenesis. In addition, the present ultrastructural observations demonstrate that considerable numbers of the bulge cells, a putative site rich in hair follicle stem cells, form gap junctions during human hair follicle development.",

METHODS: In a model of human hair follicle in vitro, the follicle was separately treated with the NGF, estrogens and minoxidil. The growth of the hair follicle was measured in length with an eyepiece micrometer. The effects of the NGF, estrogens and minoxidil were evaluated by measuring the rates of incorporation of 3H-TdR of DNA synthesis. RESULTS: The growth of the human hair follicle was showing significantly faster in the 100 ng/ml NGF and 125 micrograms/ml minoxidil groups, compared with the control (P < 0. 05), but the growth was significantly inhibited in the 0. 5 microgram/ml 17 beta-E2 group (P < 0. 05). There was no difference shown for the growth of the hair follicle in the group mixed with 100 ng/ml NGF and 0. 5 microgram/ml 17 beta-E2 (P > 0. 05). The rates of incorporation of 3H-TdR in the groups were shown that the results just correlated with the results of the above-mentioned method. CONCLUSIONS: The 100 ng/ml NGF and 125 micrograms/ml minoxidil could increase the growth of human hair follicle while the 0. 5 microgram/ml 17 beta-E2 could inhibit it. The 100 ng/ml NGF could neutralized the effect of the 0. 5 microgram/ml 17 beta-E2.",

Members of the serum-and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) family are important mediators of growth factor and hormone signaling that, like their close relatives in the Akt family, are regulated by lipid products of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. SGK3 has been implicated in the control of cell survival and regulation of ion channel activity in cultured cells. To begin to dissect the in vivo functions of SGK3, we generated and characterized Sgk3 null mice. These mice are viable and fertile, and in contrast to mice lacking SGK1 or Akt2, respectively, display normal sodium handling and glucose tolerance. However, although normal at birth, by postpartum day 4 they have begun to display an unexpected defect in hair follicle morphogenesis. The abnormality in hair follicle development is preceded by a defect in proliferation and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in hair bulb keratinocytes. Furthermore, in cultured keratinocytes, heterologous expression of SGK3 potently modulates activation of beta-catenin/Lef-1-mediated gene transcription. These data establish a role for SGK3 in normal postnatal hair follicle development, possibly involving effects on beta-catenin/Lef-1-mediated gene transcription.",

The lowermost portion of the resting (telogen) follicle consists of the bulge and secondary hair germ. We previously showed that the progeny of stem cells in the bulge form the lower follicle and hair, but the relationship of the bulge cells with the secondary hair germ cells, which are also involved in the generation of the new hair at the onset of the hair growth cycle (anagen), remains unclear. Here we address whether secondary hair germ cells are derived directly from epithelial stem cells in the adjacent bulge or whether they arise from cells within the lower follicle that survive the degenerative phase of the hair cycle (catagen). We use 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine to label bulge cells at anagen onset, and demonstrate that the lowermost portion of the bulge collapses around the hair and forms the secondary hair germ during late catagen. During the first six days of anagen onset bulge cells proliferate and self-renew. Bulge cell proliferation at this time also generates cells that form the future secondary germ. As bulge cells form the secondary germ cells at the end of catagen, they lose expression of a biochemical marker, S100A6. Remarkably, however, following injury of bulge cells by hair depilation, progenitor cells in the secondary hair germ repopulate the bulge and re-express bulge cell markers. These findings support the notion that keratinocytes can \" \" dedifferentiate \" \" to a stem cell state in response to wounding, perhaps related to signals from the stem cell niche. Finally, we also present evidence that quiescent bulge cells undergo apoptosis during follicle remodeling in catagen, indicating that a subpopulation of bulge cells is not permanent. \"",

The epithelial-mesenchymal interactions have an important role in the folliculomorphogenesis and mature hair follicle cycling. The dermal papilla, a dense aggregate of specialized dermis-derived stromal cells located at the bottom of the hair follicle, is a major component of hair, which signals the follicular epithelial cells to prolong the hair growth process. However, to date, little is known about the significance of the specific gene (s) expression in the dermal papilla cells with regard to their aggregative behaviour and hair cycling. In our previous study, the differentially gene-expressed cDNAs library had been determined by means of suppression subtractive hybridization technique between the aggregated human dermal papilla cells and control cells. Among those cDNAs library, the haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC)-related gene HSPC016 was found. In this study, the gene HSPC016 was confirmed to express in the human dermal papilla cells by means of in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. In order to rudimentarily elucidate its biological function, a recombinant eucaryotic expressing plasmid pcDNA3. 1 (+)/HSPC016 was constructed and was transfected into the human dermal papilla cells and 3T3 fibroblast cells by means of Nucleofector (TM) technique (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany).

Human hair follicle formation is different from feathers in growth direction and pattern formation of proliferative zone. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the apoptotic events together with proliferation and differentiation in developing human hair follicle and emphasis on the mechanism and biological meaning of epidermal hair canal. METHODS: We used TUNEL to examine apoptosis and Ki-67, involucrin, filaggrin immuno-localization to examine proliferation and differentiation. RESULTS: In hair germs, apoptosis was diffuse in periderm, basal keratinocytes, and mesenchymal cells with high Ki-67 expression, but spared follicular germinative cells with low Ki-67 and high bcl-2 expression. In hair pegs, apoptosis was active in high Ki-67 expression area, like outer root sheath, hair follicle sheath, but spared dermal papilla with low Ki-67 and high bcl-2 expression. In bulbous pegs, apoptosis appeared in companion layer, precortical area, inner root sheath and outer root sheath, but spared bulge area with high bcl-2 expression. Apoptosis resulted in epidermal and subepidermal hair canal formation. Filaggrin and involucrin were expressed in the lining cells of hair canal. CD1a + cells were densely distributed alone the hair canal before its opening. CONCLUSION: During human hair follicle morphogenesis, apoptosis coordinates with proliferation to shape the growth zone, creates space to free the hair shaft from follicular wall, and directs a driving force on hair shaft extension. Apoptosis accompanies the terminal differentiation of epidermal hair canal. The bottom becomes interfollicular epidermis after roof shedding and hair exposure.

To study the role of Smad4 in skin development and epidermal tumorigenesis, we disrupted this gene in skin using the Cre-loxP approach. We showed that absence of Smad4 blocked hair follicle differentiation and cycling, leading to a progressive hair loss of mutant (MT) mice. MT hair follicles exhibited diminished expression of Lef1, and increased proliferative cells in the outer root sheath. Additionally, the skin of MT mice exhibited increased proliferation of basal keratinocytes and epidermal hyperplasia. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the absence of Smad4 resulted in a block of both TGFbeta and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways, including p21, a well-known cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Consequently, all MT mice developed spontaneous malignant skin tumors from 3 months to 13 months of age. The majority of tumors are malignant squamous cell carcinomas. A most notable finding is that tumorigenesis is accompanied by inactivation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (Pten), activation of AKT, fast proliferation and nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1. These observations revealed the essential functions of Smad4-mediated signals in repressing skin tumor formation through the TGFbeta/BMP pathway, which interacts with the Pten signaling pathway.",

Thus, we hypothesized that Musashi might be expressed in stem cells and early progenitor cells of HF epithelium. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting identified Musashi-1 (Msi-1) and Musashi-2 (Msi-2) mRNA and protein in cultured mouse keratinocytes, but only Msi-1 was identified in human keratinocytes. In mice, immunohistochemical studies showed that Msi-1 and Msi-2 were expressed in the epidermis and HFs from E14. 5 until adulthood. In the early anagen phase, Msi-1 and Msi-2 were expressed in the bulge and secondary germ cells and subsequently in inner root sheath (IRS) cells, especially the middle IRS cells, during the late anagen phase. In human skin, Msi-1 was detected in fetal HF cells but not in adult HFs.

In this study, we analyzed in detail the expression domains of human desmoglein 4 protein (DSG4) in human skin relative to differentiation markers and other DSGs. Our results show that DSG4 protein is expressed in the more highly differentiated layers of the epidermis. This expression pattern in vivo is recapitulated in highly differentiated HaCaT human keratinocytes and normal human keratinocytes in vitro. In the human hair follicle, DSG4 is expressed specifically in the hair shaft cortex, the lower hair cuticle, and the upper inner root sheath (IRS) cuticle. Using a green fluorescent protein-tagged version of mouse or rat desmoglein 4 protein (Dsg4) and immuno-electron microscopy, we demonstrate that Dsg4 localizes to desmosomes both in vitro and in vivo.

Recently, hair follicles were shown to be of great importance concerning the penetration and reservoir behavior of topically applied substances. Especially microparticles are known to be efficient drug carriers into the hair follicles. It has been shown in various investigations that, depending on their size, microparticles can be utilized to enhance the penetration of substances into the hair follicles. In the present study, it was investigated whether they could also be used to block the hair follicles to stop penetration. For this purpose, the follicular penetration of a sodium fluorescein-containing hydrogel and follicular reservoir depletion were investigated by means of differential stripping in vivo. In a second study design, the skin areas were pretreated with microparticles 5 microm in diameter. Subsequently, the follicular penetration of sodium fluorescein-containing hydrogel was likewise investigated by differential stripping. The results showed that the hair follicle infundibula contained a significant fluorescent signal when sodium fluorescein in hydrogel was applied. In contrast, in the case of pretreatment with microparticles, only a very low fluorescence signal was measurable in the hair follicle infundibula. The microparticles clearly blocked the follicular orifices so that a penetration of sodium fluorescein was almost completely inhibited. This was confirmed by histological investigations. Thus, depending on their size, microparticles act as efficient drug carriers or can be utilized as follicle blockers to stop the penetration of topically applied substances.

    "text": "Keratin 17 modulates hair follicle cycling in a TNFalpha-dependent fashion. Mammalian hair follicles cycle between stages of rapid growth (anagen) and metabolic quiescence (telogen) throughout life. Transition from anagen to telogen involves an intermediate stage, catagen, consisting of a swift, apoptosis-driven involution of the lower half of the follicle. How catagen is coordinated, and spares the progenitor cells needed for anagen re-entry, is poorly understood. Keratin 17 (K17)-null mice develop alopecia in the first week post-birth, correlating with hair shaft fragility and untimely apoptosis in the hair bulb. Here we show that this abnormal apoptosis reflects premature entry into catagen. Of the proapoptotic challenges tested, K17-null skin keratinocytes in primary culture are selectively more sensitive to TNFalpha. K17 interacts with TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain protein (TRADD), a death adaptor essential for TNFR1-dependent signal relay, suggesting a functional link between this keratin and TNFalpha signaling. The activity of NF-kappaB, a downstream target of TNFalpha, is increased in K17-null skin. We also find that TNFalpha is required for a timely anagen-catagen transition in mouse pelage follicles, and that its ablation partially rescues the hair cycling defect of K17-null mice. These findings identify K17 and TNFalpha as two novel and interdependent regulators of hair cycling.",

    "text": "Generation of the primary hair follicle pattern. Hair follicles are spaced apart from one another at regular intervals through the skin. Although follicles are predominantly epidermal structures, classical tissue recombination experiments indicated that the underlying dermis defines their location during development. Although many molecules involved in hair follicle formation have been identified, the molecular interactions that determine the emergent property of pattern formation have remained elusive. We have used embryonic skin cultures to dissect signaling responses and patterning outcomes as the skin spatially organizes itself. We find that ectodysplasin receptor (Edar)-bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and transcriptional interactions are central to generation of the primary hair follicle pattern, with restriction of responsiveness, rather than localization of an inducing ligand, being the key driver in this process. The crux of this patterning mechanism is rapid Edar-positive feedback in the epidermis coupled with induction of dermal BMP4/7. The BMPs in turn repress epidermal Edar and hence follicle fate. Edar activation also induces connective tissue growth factor, an inhibitor of BMP signaling, allowing BMP action only at a distance from their site of synthesis. Consistent with this model, transgenic hyperactivation of Edar signaling leads to widespread overproduction of hair follicles. This Edar-BMP activation-inhibition mechanism appears to operate alongside a labile prepattern, suggesting that Edar-mediated stabilization of beta-catenin active foci is a key event in determining definitive follicle locations.",

Then, the isolated HFSC through enzyme digestion were seeded on dermal equivalent (DE) and cultured between the air-liquid interfaces for 14 days. Skin-equivalents was harvested and used for evaluation. RESULTS: HFSC mainly located in outer root sheet in hair follicle and human anagen hair follicles containing two distinct reservoirs for K19-positive cells located in the bulge and bulb of the follicle. These two reservoirs fused in line of outer root sheets during the catagen-telogen transition phase and individualized again in the newly forming anagen hair follicle. Based on DE, growing HFSC built a multilayered and confined epidermis. CONCLUSION: HFSC located in outer root sheets can promote hair cycle and differentiate into epidermis in vitro.",

Short-wave ultraviolet radiation (UVB) is the most carcinogenic part of the ultraviolet spectrum. The target cells of skin cancer are believed to be the bulge stem cells and/or their offspring, the transit-amplifying cells that reside in the epidermis. However, the amount of UVB penetrating epidermis and reaching the bulge cells is very low, which questions if these cells suffer sufficient DNA damage to transform into cancer stem cells. We performed this study to determine whether UV-induced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) originates from the epidermis or the hair follicles in mice. Hairless mice had their epidermis removed at different levels using CO (2) laser ablation. Simulated solar irradiations were administered either preoperatively (in total 7 weeks) or pre-and postoperatively (in total 30 weeks). Control groups were untreated or treated only with solar-simulated radiation or with laser. Blinded clinical assessments of skin tumors were carried out weekly during 12 months observation. Only mice irradiated with solar-simulated radiation both pre-and postoperatively developed tumors. Median time to first, second and third tumor ranged from 19 to 20. 5 weeks and was not significantly different between the non-laser and laser-treated groups (P > 0. 05). The tumor response was thus similar in UV-exposed mice whether they had their epidermis removed or not. No tumors appeared in control groups. Hence, UV-induced SCC of mice originates from cells of the hair follicle, presumably the bulge stem cells, indicating that ultraviolet radiation penetrates epidermis sufficiently to cause irreversible DNA damage in cells located beneath the epidermis.",

Penetration of T-oligos into the hair follicle (HF) was monitored by using FITC-labelled pTT and confocal microscopy. pTT treatment on days 1-5 after depilation, during early anagen, did not significantly alter the number and proliferation of melanocytes (Trp-2-positive cells), compared with vehicle-treated controls. However, pTT treatment on days 5-12 after depilation, during mid-to late anagen, resulted in the formation of darker hairs, that showed a significantly increased eumelanin/total melanin ratio in their sub-apical agouti band region, compared with vehicle-treated controls (P < 0. 05). By RT-PCR and western blot, full thickness skin of pTT-treated mice showed increases in Trp-1, Trp-2 and tyrosinase mRNA and protein levels, compared with control mice. Western blot analyses of two receptors that positively regulate eumelanogenesis, melanocortin type 1 receptor (MC-1R) and kit, showed increased expression of MC-1R protein in pTT-treated versus control skin, while the levels of c-kit receptor remained unchanged. These data demonstrate that pTT treatment increases eumelanogenesis in HFs, associated with increased tyrosinase, TRP-1 and MC-1R expression. These data also raise the possibility of using T-oligos to modulate hair pigmentation.",

Apart from inter and intraspecies skin differences, the excision of a skin sample may influence the penetration rate inter alia as a result of the contraction of the elastic fibres in the skin during excision. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the follicular reservoir of the hair follicles of human skin in vivo and in vitro utilizing the method of differential stripping. The results obtained revealed a significantly reduced follicular reservoir in vitro, which was only 9. 5 +/-10. 6% of the in vivo reservoir.

Adult epithelial stem cells were isolated from the HF bulge region by mechanical dissection or fluorescence-activated cell sorting using antibodies to alpha6 integrin, enriched by clonal expansion, and subcultivated on various extracellular matrices (type IV collagen, laminin-1, laminin-5, fibronectin) and in different conditioned media derived from central and peripheral corneal fibroblasts, limbal stromal fibroblasts, and 3T3 fibroblasts. Cellular phenotype and differentiation were evaluated by light and electron microscopy, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting, using antibodies against putative stem cell markers (K15, alpha6 integrin) and differentiation markers characteristic for corneal epithelium (K12, Pax6) or epidermis (K10). Using laminin-5, a major component of the corneo-limbal basement membrane zone, and conditioned medium from limbal stromal fibroblasts, clonally enriched HF stem and progenitor cells adhered rapidly and formed regularly arranged stratified cell sheets. Conditioned medium derived from limbal fibroblasts markedly upregulated expression of cornea-specific K12 and Pax6 on the mRNA and protein level, whereas expression of the epidermal keratinocyte marker K10 was strongly downregulated. These findings suggest that adult HF epithelial stem cells are capable of differentiating into corneal epithelial-like cells in vitro when exposed to a limbus-specific microenvironment. Therefore, the HF may be an easily accessible alternative therapeutic source of autologous adult stem cells for replacement of the corneal epithelium and restoration of visual function in patients with ocular surface disorders.",

How dermal papilla (DP) niche cells regulate hair follicle progenitors to control hair growth remains unclear. Using Tbx18 (Cre) to target embryonic DP precursors, we ablate the transcription factor Sox2 early and efficiently, resulting in diminished hair shaft outgrowth. We find that DP niche expression of Sox2 controls the migration speed of differentiating hair shaft progenitors. Transcriptional profiling of Sox2 null DPs reveals increased Bmp6 and decreased BMP inhibitor Sostdc1, a direct Sox2 transcriptional target. Subsequently, we identify upregulated BMP signaling in knockout hair shaft progenitors and demonstrate that Bmp6 inhibits cell migration, an effect that can be attenuated by Sostdc1. A shorter and Sox2-negative hair type lacks Sostdc1 in the DP and shows reduced migration and increased BMP activity of hair shaft progenitors. Collectively, our data identify Sox2 as a key regulator of hair growth that controls progenitor migration by fine-tuning BMP-mediated mesenchymal-epithelial crosstalk.",

Hair loss can be a psychologically devastating adverse effect of chemotherapy, but satisfactory management strategies for chemotherapy-induced alopecia remain elusive. In this Review we focus on the complex pathobiology of this side-effect. We discuss the clinical features and current management approaches, then draw upon evidence from mouse models and human hair-follicle organ-culture studies to explore the main pathobiology principles and explain why chemotherapy-induced alopecia is so challenging to manage. P53-dependent apoptosis of hair-matrix keratinocytes and chemotherapy-induced hair-cycle abnormalities, driven by the dystrophic anagen or dystrophic catagen pathway, play important parts in the degree of hair-follicle damage, alopecia phenotype, and hair-regrowth pattern. Additionally, the degree of hair-follicle stem-cell damage determines whether chemotherapy-induced alopecia is reversible. We highlight the need for carefully designed preclinical research models to generate novel, clinically relevant pointers to how this condition may be overcome.",

Stat3C transgenic (Tg) mice, which express a constitutively active form of Stat3 (Stat3C) in the basal layer of the epidermis and in the bulge region KSCs exhibited a significantly reduced number of CD34 +/alpha6 integrin + cells compared to non-transgenic (NTg) littermates. There was a concomitant increase in the Lgr-6, Lrig-1, and Sca-1 populations in the Tg mice in contrast to the CD34 and Keratin-15 positive population. In addition, increased expression of c-myc, beta-catenin, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes as well as decreased expression of alpha6-integrin was observed in the hair follicles of Tg mice. Notably, Sca-1 was found to be a direct transcriptional target of Stat3 in keratinocytes. The current data suggest that elevated Stat3 activity leads to depletion of hair follicle KSCs along with a concomitant increase of stem/progenitor cells above the bulge region. Overall, the current data indicate that Stat3 plays an important role in keratinocyte stem/progenitor cell homeostasis.",

Crude Panax ginseng has been documented to possess hair growth activity and is widely used to treat alopecia, but the effects of ginsenoside Rg3 on hair growth have not to our knowledge been determined. The aim of the current study was to identify the molecules through which Rg3 stimulates hair growth. The thymidine incorporation for measuring cell proliferation was determined. We used DNA microarray analysis to measure gene expression levels in dermal papilla (DP) cells upon treatment with Rg3. The mRNA and protein expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human DP cells were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. We also used immunohistochemistry assays to detect in vivo changes in VEGF and 3-stemness marker expressions in mouse hair follicles. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed dose-dependent increases in VEGF mRNA levels on treatment with Rg3. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that expression of VEGF was significantly up-regulated by Rg3 in a dose-dependent manner in human DP cells and in mouse hair follicles. In addition, the CD8 and CD34 were also up-regulated by Rg3 in the mouse hair follicles. It may be concluded that Rg3 might increase hair growth through stimulation of hair follicle stem cells and it has the potential to be used in hair growth products.",

The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha form heterodimeric complexes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). HIF-1alpha/ARNT and HIF-2alpha/ARNT complexes activate hypoxia-inducible genes that play critical roles in angiogenesis, anaerobic metabolism, and other processes in response to O2 deprivation. HIF-2alpha is known to regulate the function and/or differentiation of stem cells by activating the POU domain transcription factor Oct4 ; however, the precise underlying mechanism is unknown. This study examined the role of HIF-2alpha/ARNT in hair development using conditional-knockout mice, in which Arnt was specifically deleted in keratinocytes. In wild-type mice, HIF-2alpha and ARNT were highly expressed in the precortex above the hair matrix, an area containing differentiating stem cells. An analysis of hair size and type in these mice showed that loss of ARNT decreased the production of zigzag hairs, corresponding to reduced expression of HIF-2alpha and induction of the mammalian cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 (Waf1/Cip1) and p27 (Kip1). The results suggest that the HIF-2alpha/ARNT complex regulates hair follicle differentiation via induction of p21 (Waf1/Cip1) and possibly p27 (Kip1), as p27 (Kip1) expression was not altered in ARNT knockout mice. The findings provide insight into a possible mechanism underlying hair growth disorders and can be useful for future studies on hair follicle response to insults, such as chemotherapy and ionizing radiation.",

In addition, mice treated with A. sinensis showed notably decreased apoptotic cells, along with a significant change in the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and the ratio of a pair of apoptosis-associated proteins: Bcl-2 and Bax. Also, A. sinensis inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha, the phosphorylation of three mitogen-activated protein MAP kinases, and the activation of c-Jun with decreased TNF-alpha.

While the effects of PTHrP have been studied for almost 20 years, most of these studies have focused on effects on the termination of the anagen phase, giving an incomplete picture of the overall effect of PTHrP on the hair cycle. PTHrP was determined in several experimental models to promote transition of hair follicles from anagen to catagen phase, which by itself would suggest that PTHrP blockade might prolong the anagen phase and promote hair growth. However, clinical trials with topically applied PTHrP antagonists have been disappointing, leading to a reconsideration of this model. Additional studies performed in mouse models where hair follicles are damaged (alopecia areata, chemotherapy-induced alopecia) suggest that PTHrP has effects early in the hair cycle as well, promoting hair follicles ' entry into anagen phase and initiates the hair cycle. While the mechanism of this has yet to be elucidated, it may involve activation of the Wnt pathway. Thus, the overall effect of PTHrP is to stimulate and accelerate the hair cycle, and in the more clinically relevant models of hair loss where hair follicles have been damaged or become quiescent, it is the agonists, not the antagonists, which would be expected to promote hair growth.",

    "text": "Drug discovery for alopecia: gone today, hair tomorrow. INTRODUCTION: Hair loss or alopecia affects the majority of the population at some time in their life, and increasingly, sufferers are demanding treatment. Three main types of alopecia (androgenic [AGA], areata [AA] and chemotherapy-induced [CIA]) are very different, and have their own laboratory models and separate drug-discovery efforts. AREAS COVERED: In this article, the authors review the biology of hair, hair follicle (HF) cycling, stem cells and signaling pathways. AGA, due to dihydrotesterone, is treated by 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, androgen receptor blockers and ATP-sensitive potassium channel-openers. AA, which involves attack by CD8 (+) NK group 2D-positive (NKG2D (+)) T cells, is treated with immunosuppressives, biologics and JAK inhibitors. Meanwhile, CIA is treated by apoptosis inhibitors, cytokines and topical immunotherapy. EXPERT OPINION: The desire to treat alopecia with an easy topical preparation is expected to grow with time, particularly with an increasing aging population. The discovery of epidermal stem cells in the HF has given new life to the search for a cure for baldness. Drug discovery efforts are being increasingly centered on these stem cells, boosting the hair cycle and reversing miniaturization of HF. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune attack in AA will yield new drugs. New discoveries in HF neogenesis and low-level light therapy will undoubtedly have a role to play.",

Shortage of red blood cells (RBCs, erythrocytes) can have potentially life-threatening consequences for rare or unusual blood type patients with massive blood loss resulting from various conditions. Erythrocytes have been derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), but the risk of potential tumorigenicity cannot be ignored, and a majority of these cells produced from PSCs express embryonic epsilon-and fetal gamma-globins with little or no adult beta-globin and remain nucleated. Here we report a method to generate erythrocytes from human hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells (hHFMSCs) by enforcing OCT4 gene expression and cytokine stimulation. Cells generated from hHFMSCs expressed mainly the adult beta-globin chain with minimum level of the fetal gamma-globin chain. Furthermore, these cells also underwent multiple maturation events and formed enucleated erythrocytes with a biconcave disc shape. Gene expression analyses showed that OCT4 regulated the expression of genes associated with both pluripotency and erythroid development during hHFMSC transdifferentiation toward erythroid cells. These findings show that mature erythrocytes can be generated from adult somatic cells, which may serve as an alternative source of RBCs for potential autologous transfusion.",

    "text": "Effect of mycophenolic acid on proliferation of dermal papilla cells and induction of anagen hair follicles. BACKGROUND: Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, has anti-inflammatory effects, and is widely used as an immunomodulatory agent. However, the beneficial effect of MPA in hair-loss disorders is not fully understood. AIM: To investigate the direct effect of MPA on dermal papilla cells (DPCs), and to examine the hair growth-stimulating effects of MPA topically applied to mouse skin. METHODS: Cultured DPCs were treated with various concentrations of MPA and analysed by MTT assay. Expressions of hair growth-related genes, including Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related genes and cellular apoptosis-regulating genes, such as Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-9, were examined using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and western blotting. The Wnt/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway was analysed by western blotting. The effect of topically applied MPA on anagen hair follicle induction after microneedle (MN) treatment with or without minoxidil (MXD) was evaluated by histopathological examination and RT-PCR. RESULTS: MPA showed a promoting effect on DPC proliferation, which was associated with increased Axin2 transcription levels. In addition, phospho-ERK protein was detected in the MPA-treated DPCs. An increased Bcl-2/Bax transcript ratio contributed to cellular proliferation, and this was maintained in the MPA-treated environment. Topically applied MPA promoted anagen hair follicle induction in mice. The effect of MPA on hair follicles was compatible with that of MXD, and this effect was accelerated by MN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MPA promotes proliferation of DPCs and induction of anagen hair follicles in mice. This finding raises the possibility that MPA could be used as a treatment option for hair-loss disorders.",

Hair follicle morphogenesis and regeneration depend on intensive but well-orchestrated interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal components. Therefore, an alternative strategy to reproduce the process of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction in vitro could use a 3D system containing appropriate cell populations. The 3D air-liquid culture system for reproducibly generating hair follicles from dissociated epithelial and dermal papilla (DP) cells combined with a collagen-chitosan scaffold is described in this study. Wnt-CM was prepared from the supernatant of Wnt1a-expressing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) that maintain the hair-inducing gene expression of DP cells. The collagen-chitosan scaffold cells (CCS cells) were constructed using a two-step method by inoculating the Wnt-CM-treated DP cells and epidermal (EP) cells into the CCS. The cells in the air-liquid culture formed dermal condensates and a proliferative cell layer in vitro. The CCS cells were able to induce hair regeneration in nude mice. The results demonstrate that Wnt-CM can maintain the hair induction ability of DP cells in expansion cultures, and this approach can be used for large-scale preparation of CCS cells in vitro to treat hair loss.

We have previously demonstrated that hair follicles contain nestin-expressing pluripotent stem cells that can effect nerve and spinal cord repair upon transplantation. In the present study, isolated whisker follicles from nestin-driven green fluorescent protein (ND-GFP) mice were histocultured on Gelfoam for 3 weeks for the purpose of transplantation to the spinal cord to heal an induced injury. The hair shaft was cut off from Gelfoam-histocultured whisker follicles, and the remaining part of the whisker follicles containing GFP-nestin expressing pluripotent stem cells were transplanted into the injured spinal cord of nude mice, along with the Gelfoam. After 90 days, the mice were sacrificed and the spinal cord lesion was observed to have healed. ND-GFP expression was intense at the healed area of the spinal cord, as observed by fluorescence microscopy, demonstrating that the hair follicle stem cells were involved in healing the spinal cord. Unexpectedly, the transplanted whisker follicles sprouted out remarkably long hair shafts in the spinal cord during the 90 days after transplantation of Gelfoam whisker histocultures to the injured spine. The pigmented hair fibers, grown from the transplanted whisker histocultures, curved and enclosed the spinal cord.

BACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a hair loss disorder that commonly affects middle-aged men. To date, the properties of a number of natural or synthetic substances have been investigated for their ability to improve the condition. AIM: To evaluate the hair growth-promoting activities of an extract from the root of Sophora flavescens Aiton. METHODS: We used a human hair keratinocyte proliferation assay and ex vivo organ cultures of human hair follicle to examine the potential of the extract to stimulate hair growth via anagen elongation. We isolated the compounds promoting the growth of epithelial cells, and determined their chemical structures. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical study for S. flavescens extract was carried out for 6 months with patients with AGA. RESULTS: The extract stimulated the proliferation of hair keratinocytes at a concentration of 0. 1 ng/mL, while 100 ng/mL of the extract had a marked effect on hair shaft elongation in an organ culture of human hair follicle. Cell proliferation assay-directed fractionation led to the identification of two pterocarpan derivatives, L-maackiain and medicarpin, as active compounds that promote the proliferation of human hair keratinocytes. Studies in human subjects showed that improvement in the inspected alopecia scores in the lotion plus extract group were significant over a period of 6 months (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: S. flavescens root extract is effective for the treatment of AGA. The isolated two pterocarpans might have important role in this effect.",

    "text": "Hoxc13 is a crucial regulator of murine hair cycle. Hair follicles undergo cyclical growth and regression during postnatal life. Hair regression is an apoptosis-driven process strictly controlled by micro-and macro-environmental signals. However, how these signals are controlled remains largely unknown. Hoxc13, a member of the Hox gene family, is reported to play an important role in hair follicle differentiation. In the present study, we observed that Hoxc13 was highly expressed in the outer root sheath, matrix, medulla and inner root sheath of hair follicles in a hair cycle-dependent manner. We therefore investigated the role of Hoxc13 in hair follicle cycling. Injection of ShRNA (ShHoxc13) to suppress Hoxc13 in early anagen promoted premature catagen entry, shown by significantly decreased hair length and hair bulb size, increased percentage of catagen hair follicles, hair cycle score and TUNEL + cells and inhibited proliferation. In contrast, local injection of recombinant Hoxc13 polypeptide (rhHoxc13) during the late anagen phase prolonged the anagen phase. Additionally, rhHoxc13 injections during the telogen phase significantly promoted hair growth and induced the anagen progression. At the molecular level, the expression of phosphorylated smad2 (p-smad2), a key factor of active TGF-beta1 signaling, was up-regulated in the ShHoxc13-treated hair follicles and down-regulated in rhHoxc13-treated hair follicles, suggesting that Hoxc13 might block anagen-catagen transition by inhibiting the TGF-beta1 signaling. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that Hoxc13 is a novel and crucial regulator of the hair cycle. This might also provide an understanding of the mechanism of the ' hair cycle clock ' and the development of alopecia treatments.",

Twenty-two weeks after transplantation, a single dose of cyclophosphamide (Cph) was administered to mice in the Cph100 (100 mg/kg) and Cph150 (150 mg/kg) groups. On day 6, hair follicles showed dystrophic changes, with swollen dermal papilla and ectopic melanin clumping in the hair bulb. In addition, upregulated expression of apoptotic regulators [P53, Fas/Fas-ligand, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL/TRAIL receptor), and Bax], increased apoptotic matrix keratinocytes, downregulated Ki67 expression, and decreased melanogenic protein in the hair bulb were noted in both groups. After 12 treatment days, hair follicles in Cph100 mice appeared to diminish dystrophic changes. In contrast, hair follicles of Cph150 mice prematurely entered a dystrophic catagen phase after 9 treatment days, and immunofluorescence staining for Ki67 and melanogenic protein expressions was barely visible. Two hair follicle damage response pathways were observed in this model, namely dystrophic anagen (Cph100) and catagen (Cph150) pathways.

BACKGROUND: Photothermolysis of unwanted hair depends on the presence of melanin in the hair follicle as the chromophore, but is not effective in patients with non-pigmented, melanin-sparse hair shafts and follicles. This split-scalp, double-blind study was to monitor the efficacy of melanin bound in nanosomes to inject exogenous melanin into the hair follicles thus potentiating successful photothermolysis. < br/> MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve patients, phototypes II-III, with white or very fair hair, were treated with a compound containing melanin encapsulated in nanosomes (Melaser < sup > </sup >) together with a fluorescent marker. Two equal 6 cm2 areas were marked on each side of the occiput of the subjects. The compound was applied to a randomly selected experimental side on each patient (area A), and a saline solution applied in the same manner to the contralateral control side (area B). Penetration of the melanin into the hair follicle was assessed using optical and fluorescence microscopy. Also, condition of hair structure was checked in vivo after standard laser settings used for epilation. < br/> RESULTS: A slight transient erythema was observed in those areas where the compound was applied with some perifollicular edema. No such effects were noticed in those areas where saline solution was applied. No persistent complications such as scarring, hypo-or hyperpigmentation were observed in any of the experimental or control areas. Under fluorescence microscopy, the hair structures in the areas to which the compound had been applied showed a clear melanin deposit confirmed by the immunofluorescence intensity, which was highest at 2 hours after application. By optical microscopy, external melanin was deposited in hair follicles. Tests with standard settings for epilation were efficacious in damaging melanin-marked white hair. < br/> CONCLUSION: This study strongly suggests the safety and efficacy of the application of nanosomes encapsulating melanin for the introduction of melanin into hair follicles.

Generally, the blood and skin concentration profiles and steady-state skin concentration of topically applied or exposed chemicals can be calculated from the in vitro skin permeation profile. However, these calculation methods are particularly applicable to chemicals for which the main pathway is via the stratum corneum. If the contribution of hair follicles to the total skin permeation of chemicals can be obtained in detail, their blood and skin concentrations can be more precisely predicted. In the present study, the contribution of the hair follicle pathway to the skin permeation of topically applied or exposed chemicals was calculated from the difference between their permeability coefficients through skin with and without hair follicle plugging, using an in vitro skin permeation experiment. The obtained results reveal that the contribution of the hair follicle pathway can be predicted by using the chemicals ' lipophilicity. For hydrophilic chemicals (logarithm of n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log Ko/w) < 0), a greater reduction of permeation due to hair follicle plugging was observed than for lipophilic chemicals (log Ko/w > = 0). In addition, the ratio of this reduction was decreased with an increase in log Ko/w. This consideration of the hair follicle pathway would be helpful to investigate the efficacy and safety of chemicals after topical application or exposure to them because skin permeation and disposition should vary among skins in different body sites due to differences in the density of hair follicles.",

In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of Undariopsis peterseniana, an edible brown alga, on hair growth. The treatment of vibrissa follicles with U. peterseniana extract ex vivo for 21 days significantly increased the hair-fiber lengths. The U. peterseniana extract also significantly accelerated anagen initiation in vivo. Moreover, we found that U. peterseniana extract was able to open the KATP channel, which may contribute to increased hair growth. The U. peterseniana extract decreased 5alpha-reductase activity and markedly increased the proliferation of dermal papilla cells, a central regulator of the hair cycle. The U. peterseniana extract increased the levels of cell cycle proteins, such as Cyclin D1, phospho (ser780)-pRB, Cyclin E, phospho-CDK2, and CDK2. The U. peterseniana extract also increased the phosphorylation of ERK and the levels of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling proteins such as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) and beta-catenin. These results suggested that the U. peterseniana extract had the potential to influence hair growth by dermal papilla cells proliferation through the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin and ERK pathways. We isolated a principal of the U. peterseniana extract, which was subsequently identified as apo-9 '-fucoxanthinone, a trichogenic compound.

The use of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) in dairy cattle is forbidden in the European Union. Due to the very low circulating concentration of rbST in treated animals, its direct detection is still a challenge. Therefore, the use of indirect methods to detect the ab (use) of rbST in dairy cattle appears as a good alternative. In the past few years, gene expression demonstrated its utility in screening the use of illicit substances in both humans and animals. In this study, a comparison of three types of matrices (milk somatic cells, blood, and hair follicles) was carried out to evaluate their potential use for routine control of rbST using 15 gene-expression profiles. A total of six rbST-treated cows and three control cows were included in the study. A subcutaneous injection containing 500 mg of rbST was administered to the treated group. Samples of the three matrices were collected before rbST administration, and at three and nine days after treatment. The quality of RNA extracted was higher in the blood and hair-follicle samples than in the milk somatic cells. In the three matrices, there were significant differences in the expression of some genes, with milk somatic cells and blood presenting the the best matrices. On this note, the cyclin D1 (CCND1), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) genes showed potential as biomarkers of rbST treatment. Therefore, blood, somatic cells, and follicle hair should be considered as promising sources of RNA, and can be used in gene-expression assays to routinely control the illicit use of rbST.",

    "text": "Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of goat skins identifies signatures associated with hair cycling. BACKGROUND: Hair follicles (HFs), upon development, undergo repetitive cycles of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen). The transition between the stages is determined by multiple molecular signals, including DNA methylation, which plays important roles in mammalian cellular identity and is essential for the development of HFs. Secondary hair follicles (SHFs) in cashmere goat exhibit classic cyclic hair development, and little has been done on a genome-wide scale to examine potentially methylated genes involved in the hair cyclic transition. RESULTS: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles between skin tissues sampled during the anagen and telogen stages in cashmere goats were investigated using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). The methylation status was observed to be higher in the skin samples with HFs in the telogen than those in the anagen stage. A total of 1311 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between the two groups, which contained 493 fully annotated DMR-related genes (DMGs) (269 Hyper-DMGs and 224 Hypo-DMGs). Furthermore, a significant over-representation of the functional categories for DMGs related to immune response and intercellular crosstalk during hair cycling was observed. By integrating DNA methylation and mRNA expression data, we revealed that four genes (FMN1, PCOLCE, SPTLC3, and COL5A1) are crucial factors for elucidating epigenetic mechanisms contributing to the telogen-to-anagen transition. CONCLUSION: Our study provided systematic methylome maps pertaining to the hair cycling stages (anagen vs telogen) at a single-base resolution, and revealed stage-specific methylation loci during cashmere growth or quiescence. Furthermore, we identified epigenetically regulated genes that are potentially involved in HF development and growth in cashmere goats, and likely in other mammal species.",

The aim of this study was to identify other mechanisms by which tofacitinib, applied topically, promotes hair growth. The results showed that histopathological studies in mice treated topically with tofacitinib increased number of hair follicles, ratio of hair follicles in anagen phase, and length of hair infundibulum, and a reduced interfollicular epidermal thickness, compared to DMSO-treated mice. RT-PCR experiments showed significant increases in the expression of noggin (P < 0. 05) and BMP4 (P < 0. 05) mRNAs, which were greater than those in the vehicle-controlled group. Moreover, the expression of noggin and BMP4 mRNAs was significantly higher in the tofacitinib-treated group than in the minoxidil-treated group.

As one of the adult stem cells, melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicle bulge niche can proliferate, differentiate and keep quiescence to control and coordinate tissue homeostasis, repair and regeneration. In synchrony with hair follicle stem cells, melanocyte stem cells in the hair follicles undergo cyclic activation, degeneration and resting phases, to pigment the hairs and to preserve the stem cells. Disorder of melanocytes results in severe skin problems such as canities, vitiligo and even melanoma.

CONCLUSION: Cleaning agent residual index did not differ according to removal method. Cleaning agent remained in the hair follicle (hair roots, hair bulbs) despite removal from the skin by washing or wiping. Further studies are required to apply \" \" removable-by-wiping \" \" cleaning agents for people with vulnerable skin. \"",

BACKGROUND: Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) play a key role in hair regeneration and morphogenesis. Therefore, tremendous efforts have been made to promote DPC hair inductivity. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the mitogenic and hair inductive effects of hypoxia on DPCs and examine the underlying mechanism of hypoxia-induced stimulation of DPCs. METHODS: DPCs ' hair inductivity was examined under normoxia (20% O2) and hypoxia (2% O2). RESULTS: Hypoxia significantly increased the proliferation and delayed senescence of DPCs via Akt phosphorylation and downstream pathways. Hypoxia upregulated growth factor secretion of DPCs through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Hypoxia-preconditioned DPCs induced the telogen-to-anagen transition in C3 H mice, and also enhanced hair neogenesis in a hair reconstitution assay. Injected green fluorescent protein-labelled DPCs migrated to the outer root sheath of the hair follicle, and hypoxia-preconditioning increased survival and migration of DPCs in vivo. Conditioned medium obtained from hypoxia increased the hair length of mouse vibrissa follicles via upregulation of alkaline phosphatase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. We examined the mechanism of this hypoxia-induced stimulation, and found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role. For example, inhibition of ROS generation by N-acetylcysteine or diphenyleneiodonium treatment attenuated DPCs ' hypoxia-induced stimulation, but treatment with ROS donors induced mitogenic effects and anagen transition. NADPH oxidase 4 is highly expressed in the DPC nuclear region, and NOX4 knockout by CRISPR-Cas9 attenuated the hypoxia-induced stimulation of DPCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that DPC culture under hypoxia has great advantages over normoxia, and is a novel solution for producing DPCs for cell therapy. What ' s already known about this topic ? Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) play a key role in hair regeneration and morphogenesis, but they are difficult to isolate and expand for use in cell therapy. Tremendous efforts have been made to increase proliferation of DPCs and promote their hair formation ability. What does this study add ? Hypoxia (2% O2) culture of DPCs increases proliferation, delays senescence and enhances hair inductivity of DPCs. Reactive oxygen species play a key role in hypoxia-induced stimulation of DPC. What is the translational message ? Preconditioning DPCs under hypoxia improves their hair regenerative potential, and is a novel solution for producing DPCs for cell therapy to treat hair loss.",

BACKGROUND: Analytical measures for the pharmacodynamics understanding of drug induced scalp hair responses are lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study measured in detail dynamics of hair productivity on two scalp test sites showing male pattern hair loss. The natural regression decay rate established after 2 years without treatment was followed by treatment with daily oral intake of 1 mg finasteride. RESULTS: While terminal hair (diameter > = 40 mum) were maintained \" \" on-drug, \" \" within 30 months \" \" off-drug \" \" MPHL significantly worsened as 94% terminal hair miniaturised and became unproductive. Accordingly, the viable drug responding follicles were qualified as \" \" finasteride dependent \" \" unravelling a hereto unreported \" \" rebound effect \" \" after interruption of the drug intake. Interestingly, the transformation of terminal hair into miniaturised hair occurred only after 12 months without treatment, that is the time necessary to complete a clinically significant full hair cycle initiated during the drug intake. This explains why exogen hair release and miniaturisation occurred only between 12 and 30 months \" \" off-drug \" \" while resistant hair grew also slower.

BACKGROUND: Miliacin, the main triterpenoid from millet, is known to stimulate keratinocyte metabolism and proliferation. Polar lipids are able to form vesicles with active compounds and to improve their bioavailability. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to demonstrate potential benefits of a solution of miliacin encapsulated within polar lipids (MePL) on telogen effluvium prevention and hair condition in women. METHODS: After preliminary cell proliferation studies, a placebo-controlled, multicentric, randomized, double-blind trial was performed on sixty-five nonmenopausal women affected by telogen effluvium, to assess the efficacy of a 12-week oral supplementation with MePL. Telogen and anagen densities were determined by phototrichogram analysis. Scalp dryness and hair brightness were clinically evaluated using a Likert scale. RESULTS: MePL further enhanced cell proliferation in hair bulb from human scalp than miliacin alone. Compared to the placebo treatment, MePL supplementation significantly reduced telogen density after 12 weeks of treatment. An increase of anagen density was observed in both groups, although there was no significant difference between the two treatments. Scalp dryness was more decreased in the MePL group than in the placebo group. A better improvement of hair brightness was also observed after 12 weeks of supplementation with MePL. CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of MePL supplementation significantly reduced the hair density in the telogen phase and, in parallel, improved scalp dryness and hair condition. These effects could be linked to MePL activity on cell proliferation in hair bulb. MePL is an original association of plant extract that could help to prevent and/or limit hair loss in women. \"",

The primary feather follicles are universal skin appendages widely distributed in the skin of feathered birds. The morphogenesis and development of the primary feather follicles in goose skin remain largely unknown. Here, the induction of primary feather follicles in goose embryonic skin (pre-induction vs induction) was investigated by de novo transcriptome analyses to reveal 409 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The DEGs were characterized to potentially regulate the de novo formation of feather follicle primordia consisting of placode (4 genes) and dermal condensate (12 genes), and the thickening of epidermis (5 genes) and dermal fibroblasts (17 genes), respectively. Further analyses enriched DEGs into GO terms represented as cell adhesion and KEGG pathways including Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways that are highly correlated with cell communication and molecular regulation. Six selected Wnt pathway genes were detected by qPCR with up-regulation in goose skin during the induction of primary feather follicles. The localization of WNT16, SFRP1 and FRZB by in situ hybridization showed weak expression in the primary feather primordia, whereas FZD1, LEF1 and DKK1 were expressed initially in the inter-follicular skin and feather follicle primordia, then mainly restricted in the feather primordia. The spatial-temporal expression patterns indicate that Wnt pathway genes DKK1, FZD1 and LEF1 are the important regulators functioned in the induction of primary feather follicle in goose skin. The dynamic molecular changes and specific gene expression patterns revealed in this report provide the general knowledge of primary feather follicle and skin development in waterfowl, and contribute to further understand the diversity of hair and feather development beyond the mouse and chicken models.",

A 3500-year-old papyrus from ancient Egypt provides a list of treatments for many diseases including \" \" bite hair loss, \" \" most likely alopecia areata (AA). The treatment of AA remained largely unchanged for over 1500 years. In 30 CE, Celsus described AA presenting as scalp alopecia in spots or the \" \" windings of a snake \" \" and suggested treatment with caustic compounds and scarification. The first \" \" modern \" \" description of AA came in 1813, though treatment still largely employed caustic agents. From the mid-19th century onwards, various hypotheses of AA development were put forward including infectious microbes (1843), nerve defects (1858), physical trauma and psychological stress (1881), focal inflammation (1891), diseased teeth (1902), toxins (1912) and endocrine disorders (1913). The 1950s brought new treatment developments with the first use of corticosteroid compounds (1952), and the first suggestion that AA was an autoimmune disease (1958). Research progressively shifted towards identifying hair follicle-specific autoantibodies (1995). The potential role of lymphocytes in AA was made implicit with immunohistological studies (1980s). However, studies confirming their functional role were not published until the development of rodent models (1990s). Genetic studies, particularly genome-wide association studies, have now come to the forefront and open up a new era of AA investigation (2000s). Today, AA research is actively focused on genetics, the microbiome, dietary modulators, the role of atopy, immune cell types in AA pathogenesis, primary antigenic targets, mechanisms by which immune cells influence hair growth, and of course the development of new treatments based on these discoveries. \"",

    "text": "CRH receptor antagonists from Pulsatilla chinensis prevent CRH-induced premature catagen transition in human hair follicles. BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in the relationship among stress hormones, neuroendocrine signaling, and skin diseases, including hair loss. Previous reports showed that stress hormones inhibit human hair growth and induce early catagen transition. Moreover, a CRH receptor antagonist reversed CRH-induced alopecia in a mouse model, suggesting that antagonization of the CRH receptor is a key clinical strategy to treat stress-induced hair loss. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of CRH receptor antagonists from Pulsatilla chinensis on human hair follicles (hHFs) and human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs). METHODS: hHFs were observed and scored by hair cycle. The levels of cAMP, a second messenger, were measured in each group. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of factors related to the hair cycle were measured. Furthermore, the expression levels of various members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway related to stress were measured. RESULTS: CRH induced early catagen transition in an ex vivo hair organ culture model. In addition, CRH downregulated the levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and hair anagen-related cytokines in cultured hDPCs. Moreover, CRH induced the phosphorylation of JNK, c-Jun, p38, ERK, and Akt in cultured hDPCs. CRH receptor antagonists isolated from P chinensis reversed these CRH-induced modulations in both ex vivo hair follicles (HFs) and cultured hDPCs. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that P chinensis effectively blocks CRH receptor function and that saponin derivatives from P chinensis could be a pharmaceutical and cosmetic approach to treat stress-induced hair loss.",

Increasing cashmere yield is one of the important goals of cashmere goat breeding. To achieve this goal, we screened the key genes that can improve cashmere performance. In this study, we used the RNA raw datasets of the skin and dermal papilla cells of secondary hair follicle (SHF-DPCs) samples of hair follicle (HF) anagen and telogen of Albas cashmere goats and identified a set of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs). To explore potential associations between gene sets and SHF growth features and to identify candidate genes, we detected functional enrichment and constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Through comprehensive analysis, we selected Thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4), Rho GTPase activating protein 6 (ARHGAP6), ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 15, (ADAMTS15), Chordin (CHRD), and SPARC (Osteonectin), cwcv and kazal-like domains proteoglycan 1 (SPOCK1) as candidate genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for these genes revealed Tbeta4 and ARHGAP6 have a close association with the growth and development of SHF-DPCs. However, the expression of Tbeta4 in the anagen was higher than that in the telogen, so we finally chose Tbeta4 as the ultimate research object. Overexpressing Tbeta4 promoted and silencing Tbeta4 inhibited the proliferation of SHF-DPCs. These findings suggest that Tbeta4 can promote the growth and development of SHF-DPCs and indicate that this molecule may be a valuable target for increasing cashmere production.",

A variety of cat breeds have been developed via novelty selection on aesthetic, dermatological traits, such as coat colors and fur types. A recently developed breed, the lykoi (a. k. a. werewolf cat), was bred from cats with a sparse hair coat with roaning, implying full color and all white hairs. The lykoi phenotype is a form of hypotrichia, presenting as a significant reduction in the average numbers of follicles per hair follicle group as compared to domestic shorthair cats, a mild to severe perifollicular to mural lymphocytic infiltration in 77% of observed hair follicle groups, and the follicles are often miniaturized, dilated, and dysplastic. Whole genome sequencing was conducted on a single lykoi cat that was a cross between two independently ascertained lineages. Comparison to the 99 Lives dataset of 194 non-lykoi cats suggested two variants in the cat homolog for Hairless (HR) (HR lysine demethylase and nuclear receptor corepressor) as candidate causal gene variants. The lykoi cat was a compound heterozygote for two loss of function variants in HR, an exon 3 c. 1255 _ 1256dupGT (chrB1: 36040783), which should produce a stop codon at amino acid 420 (p. Gln420Serfs * 100) and, an exon 18 c. 3389insGACA (chrB1: 36051555), which should produce a stop codon at amino acid position 1130 (p. Ser1130Argfs * 29). Ascertainment of 14 additional cats from founder lineages from Canada, France and different areas of the USA identified four additional loss of function HR variants likely causing the highly similar phenotypic hair coat across the diverse cats. The novel variants in HR for cat hypotrichia can now be established between minor differences in the phenotypic presentations.",

    "text": "Effects on tactile transmission by serotonin transporter inhibitors at Merkel discs of mouse whisker hair follicles. The Merkel disc is a main type of tactile end organs formed by Merkel cells and Abeta-afferent endings as first tactile sensory synapses. They are highly abundant in fingertips, touch domes, and whisker hair follicles of mammals and are essential for sensory tasks including social interaction, environmental exploration, and tactile discrimination. We have recently shown that Merkel discs use serotonin to transmit tactile signals from Merkel cells to Abeta-afferent endings to drive slowly adapting type 1 impulses on the Abeta-afferent nerves. This raises a question as whether the serotoninergic transmission at Merkel discs may be regulated by serotonin transporters and whether serotonin transporter inhibitors may affect the tactile transmission. Here, we made recordings from whisker afferent nerves of mouse whisker hair follicles and tested the effects of monoamine transporter inhibitors on slowly adapting type 1 impulses. We show that methamphetamine, a monoamine releasing facilitator and reuptake inhibitor, elicited spontaneous impulses as well as increased the numbers of slowly adapting type 1 impulses elicited by whisker hair deflections. S-duloxetine, a potent inhibitor of transporters of serotonin and norepinephrine, and fluoxetine, a selective inhibitor of serotonin transporters, both also increased the numbers of slowly adapting type 1 impulses. Prolonged treatment of whisker hair follicles with methamphetamine abolished most of slowly adapting type 1 impulses. Furthermore, the treatment of whisker hair follicles with methamphetamine resulted in serotonin release from whisker hair follicles. Taken together, our results suggest that serotonin transporters play a role in regulating tactile transmission at Merkel discs.",

Based on the critical role of the FGF5 isoform, FGF5s, in the hair growth cycle, it may be a good therapeutic candidate for the prevention of hair loss, as well as the promotion of hair growth. To investigate its potential use for hair growth, a mutant form of the FGF5s protein (FGF5sC93S) was generated, expressed, and purified. The FGF5sC93S mutant was able to antagonize FGF5-induced mitogenic activity, which normally triggers the conversion of hair follicles from the anagen phase to the catagen phase. In addition, the FGF5sC93S mutant efficiently suppressed gene expression induced by FGF5 both human outer root sheath (hORS) and human dermal papilla (hDP) cells. Administration of FGF5sC93S proteins onto the scalps of human subjects significantly increased the total number of hairs at 24 weeks. Together, our data demonstrate that a mutant form of the FGF5s protein could be used as a potential hair promoting agent.",

BACKGROUND: Facial hair transplantation has become an increasingly popular modality to create a more masculine appearance for transmasculine patients. OBJECTIVES: This aim of this study was to review the current literature regarding facial hair transplantation and provide recommendations and best practices for transgender patients. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase databases was conducted for studies published through April 2020 for publications discussing facial hair transplant in transmasculine patients, in addition to the nontransgender population. Data extracted include patient demographics, techniques, outcomes, complications, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: We identified 2 articles discussing facial hair transplantation in transmasculine patients. Due to the paucity of publications describing facial hair transplantation in transmasculine patients, data regarding facial hair transplant from the cisgender population were utilized to augment our review and recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Facial hair transplant is a safe and effective means of promoting a masculine appearance for transgender patients. Nevertheless, facial hair transplantation should be deferred until at least 1 year after the initiation of testosterone therapy to allow surgeons to more accurately identify regions that would benefit the most from transplantation. Additionally, providers should engage patients in discussions about any plans to undergo facial masculinization surgery because this can alter the position of transplanted hairs. Currently, follicular unit extraction from the occipital scalp is the preferred technique, with use of the temporal scalp if additional grafts are needed. Patients should be advised that a secondary grafting procedure may be needed a year after initial transplant to achieve desired density. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4:",

Unlike healthy skin, poor biological and mechanical properties of scar tissue in the recipient area can reduce the survival rate of hair graft following hair transplantation. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to determine if combined non-ablative fractional laser (NAFL) and microfat injection could improve the survival rate of hair grafts on post burn scar. METHODS: Thirteen patients with alopecia resulting from burn scar in hair-bearing areas of the scalp and face were treated with combined NAFL and microfat graft and subsequent follicular unit extraction hair transplantation. Cicatricial alopecia occurred on the scalp, eyebrow, mustache, and beard areas. Patients were treated with 3 to 6 sessions of NAFL and 2 to 5 sessions of microfat graft injections, followed by 1 session of hair transplantation employing the follicular unit extraction technique. RESULTS: Hair transplantation was successfully performed with good to excellent results. The survival rate of transplanted follicular units ranged from 76% to 95% (mean, 85. 04%), and the density success rate per square centimeter ranged from 76. 9% to 95. 2% (mean, 84. 54%).

The term \" \" cutaneous lymphadenoma \" \" was coined in this journal for an unusual lymphoepithelial cutaneous adnexal neoplasm, possibly with immature pilosebaceous differentiation. Some authors further proposed that cutaneous lymphadenoma was an adamantinoid trichoblastoma. However, although a hair follicle differentiation is widely accepted, the fact that this is a lymphoepithelial tumor is not appropriately explained by the trichoblastoma hypothesis. Our goal was to further clarify the phenotypic and genotypic features of cutaneous lymphadenoma in a series of 11 cases. Histologically, a lobular architecture surrounded by a dense fibrous stroma was present in all cases. The lobules were composed of epithelial cells admixtured with small lymphocytes and isolated or clustered large Reed-Sternberg-like (RS-L) cells. The epithelial cells were diffusely positive for the hair follicle stem cell markers CK15, PHLDA1, and for androgen receptor. No immunostaining for markers of sebaceous differentiation was found. Intraepithelial lymphocytes were predominantly CD3 +, CD4 +, FoxP3 + T cells. RS-L cells showed both strong Jagged-1 and Notch1 cytoplasmic immunostaining. Androgen-regulated NKX3. 1 nuclear immunostaining was present in a subset of large intralobular cells in all cases. Double immunostaining showed coexpression of NKX3. 1 and CD30 in a subset of RS-L cells. No immunostaining for lymphocytic or epithelial markers was present in RS-L cells. EGFR, PIK3CA, and FGFR3 somatic mutations were found by next-generation sequencing in 56% of the cases. We consider that cutaneous lymphadenoma is a distinct benign lymphoepithelial tumor with androgen receptor and hair follicle bulge stem cell marker expression, RS-L cell-derived Notch1 ligand, and common EGFR gene mutations. \"",

Vitamin A metabolism proteins localized to the pilosebaceous unit (PSU ; hair follicle and sebaceous gland) ; and were regulated by E2 in other tissues. This study tests the hypothesis that E2 also regulates vitamin A metabolism in the PSU. First, aromatase and estrogen receptors localized to similar sites as retinoid metabolism proteins during mid-anagen. Next, female and male wax stripped C57BL/6J mice were topically treated with E2, the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182, 780 (ICI), letrozole, E2 plus letrozole, or vehicle control (acetone) during mid-anagen. E2 or one of its inhibitors regulated most of the vitamin A metabolism genes and proteins examined in a sex-dependent manner. Most components were higher in females and reduced with ICI in females. ICI reductions occurred in the premedulla, sebaceous gland, and epidermis. Reduced E2 also reduced RA receptors in the sebaceous gland and bulge in females. However, reduced E2 increased the number of retinal dehydrogenase 2 positive hair follicle associated dermal dendritic cells in males.

Introduction: Regenerative medicine is a promising approach for hair loss ; however, its primary challenge is the inductivity of human dermal papilla cells (DPCs), which rapidly lose hair growth-inducing properties in 2D culture. Despite extensive research efforts to construct DPCs, current 3D microenvironments fabricated to restore hair inductivity remain insufficient. Objectives: Here, we aimed to fabricate ECM-enriched controllable vascularized dermal papilla (DP) spheroids that highly mimic in vivo DPCs microenvironments to restore their hair inductivity. Methods: We employed layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly using gelatin and alginate to construct nanoscale biomimetic ECM for DPCs, with Ca2 + as a cross-linking agent to create controllable DP spheroids. DPCs were also co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells to construct vascularized DP spheroids. Immunofluorescence staining and angiography was used to detect angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. RNA sequencing and in vivo implantation were employed to investigate DPCs signature. Results: LbL technology enabled DPCs to aggregate into controllable DP spheroids of size and cell numbers similar to those of primary DP. Vascularization prevented hypoxia-induced necrosis and functioned in association with host vessels post-transplantation. Compared with traditional 3D culture, nanoscale ECM and vascularization were found to restore the transcriptional signature of DPCs and triple hair induction efficiency following engraftment. Conclusion: Our novel biomimetic developmental tissue engineering strategy is a crucial step toward the recovery of human DPC hair inductivity, which would enable the rapid clinical application of large-scale hair regeneration platforms.",

METHODS: Thirty-five Sprague-Dawley/Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into five groups: non-shaved control, shaved control, NaB 1 mg (shaved + NaB 1 mg elemental B/kg CA), NaB 2 mg (shaved + NaB 2 mg elemental B/kg CA), and NaB 4 mg (shaved + NaB 4 mg elemental B/kg CA). Hair density was measured using the trichoscopy method. Dorsal skin samples were examined histopathologically at the end of the 42nd day, and follicle count, follicle diameter, and subcutaneous tissue thickness were recorded. Wnt-1, beta-catenin, PDGF, VEGF, TGF-beta1, and collagen I levels were analyzed with the Western blot method. RESULTS: In trichoscopy measurements, hair density increased in the NaB 4 mg group (90. 9%). In histopathological examination, anagen follicles were observed to increase in the NaB 1 mg and 2 mg groups (p < 0. 05). Follicle diameter increased in all NaB groups (p < 0. 05). The Wnt-1, beta-catenin, PDGF, VEGF, TGF-beta1, and collagen I level increased in the NaB 1 mg and 2 mg groups (p < 0. 05), but they were similar in the NaB 4 mg group compared to the control groups (p > 0. 05).

Alopecia is a non-specific term for hair loss clinically diagnosed by the hair loss pattern and histological analysis of patient scalp biopsies. The immune-mediated alopecia subtypes, including alopecia areata, lichen planopilaris, frontal fibrosing alopecia, and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, are common, significant forms of alopecia subtypes. For example, alopecia areata is the most common autoimmune disease with a lifetime incidence of approximately 2% of the world ' s population. In this perspective, we discuss major results from studies of immune-mediated alopecia subtypes. These studies suggest the key event in disease onset as the collapse in immune privilege, which alters the hair follicle microenvironment, e. g., upregulation of major histocompatibility complex molecules and increase of cytokine production, and results in immune cell infiltration, inflammatory responses, and damage of hair follicles. We note that previous studies have established that the hair follicle has a complex mechanical microenvironment, which may regulate the function of not only tissue cells but also immune cell infiltrates. This suggests a potential for mechanobiology to contribute to alopecia research by adding new methods, new approaches, and new ways of thinking, which is missing in the existing literature. To fill this a gap in the alopecia research space, we develop a mechanobiological hypothesis that alterations in the hair follicle microenvironment, specifically in the mechanically responsive tissues and cells, partially due to loss of immune privilege, may be contributors to disease pathology. We further focus our discussion on the potential for applying mechanoimmunology to the study of T cell infiltrates in the hair follicle, as they are considered primary contributors to alopecia pathology.

We report that adult alpha3-integrin-deficient skin has severe abnormalities restricted to hair follicle morphology, which include stunted hair follicle growth, increased hair follicle fragility, aberrant pigment accumulation and formation of hair follicle clusters. These abnormalities are caused by a combination of defects in: (1) keratinocyte cytoskeletal organisation, (2) outer root sheath architecture and (3) integrity of the lamina densa.

    "text": "\" Plasticity and cytokinetic dynamics of the hair follicle mesenchyme: implications for hair growth control. The continuously remodeled hair follicle is a uniquely exploitable epithelial-mesenchymal interaction system. In contrast to the cyclical fate of the hair follicle epithelium, the dynamics of the supposedly stable hair follicle mesenchyme remains enigmatic. Here we address this issue using the C57BL/6 hair research model. During hair growth, increase in total follicular papilla size was associated with doubling of papilla cell numbers, much of which occurred before intra-follicular papilla cell proliferation, and subsequent to mitosis in the proximal connective tissue sheath. This indicates that some papilla cells originate in, and migrate from, the proliferating pool of connective tissue sheath fibroblasts. Follicular papilla cell number and total papilla size were maximal by anagen VI, but intriguingly, decreased by 25% during this period of sustained hair production. This cell loss, which continued during catagen, was not associated with intra-follicular papilla apoptosis, strongly indicating that fibroblasts migrate out of the late anagen/early catagen papilla and re-enter the proximal connective tissue sheath. Low-level apoptosis occurred only here, along with the \" \" detachment \" \" of cells from the regressing connective tissue sheath. Thus, the hair follicle mesenchyme exhibits significant hair cycle-associated plasticity. Modulation of these cell interchanges is likely to be important during clinically important hair follicle transformations, e. g. vellus-to-terminal and terminal-to-vellus during androgenetic alopecia. \"",

AP-2alpha is a member of a family of transcription factors expressed in cells of the epithelial and neural crest lineage. AP-2alpha plays an essential role in embryonic development and in regulation of epithelial gene transcription. To further characterize the role of AP-2alpha in skin biology, we assessed its expression in the skin of C57BL/6J mice during defined stages of hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling. During early hair follicle morphogenesis, AP-2alpha was upregulated in the epidermal placode, in the basal keratinocytes of the hair follicle bud, and then in the inner root sheath. The follicular papilla cells underwent a brief upregulation of AP-2alpha expression during the initiation of hair shaft formation and active hair follicle downward growth. Completion of hair follicle morphogenesis was associated with a marked reduction of AP-2alpha immunoreactivity in the lower portion of the hair follicle including both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments. In adolescent mouse skin, consistently strong AP-2alpha expression was found in the basal keratinocytes of the epidermis, in the hair follicle infundibulum, and in the sebocytes. In the follicular papilla, AP-2alpha was weakly expressed in telogen, significantly upregulated in early anagen, then gradually declined, and reappeared again in middle catagen. In the inner root sheaths, AP-2alpha expression was detected during early and middle anagen and during middle catagen stages. Prominent AP-2alpha expression was also seen in the zone of club hair formation. Therefore, AP-2alpha upregulation in both epithelial and mesenchymal hair follicle compartments was coordinated with initiation of major remodeling processes. Our findings support the use of the hair follicle as a model to explore the role of AP-2alpha in physiologic remodeling of developing organs and in reciprocal ectodermal-mesenchymal interactions.",

This is where stem cells for the hair follicle outer-root sheath are thought to be located. The relatively small, oval-shaped, nestin-expressing cells in the bulge area surround the hair shaft and are interconnected by short dendrites. The precise locations of the nestin-expressing cells in the hair follicle vary with the hair cycle. During telogen or resting phase and in early anagen, the GFP-positive cells are mainly in the bulge area. However, in mid-and late anagen, the GFP-expressing cells are located in the upper outer-root sheath as well as in the bulge area but not in the hair matrix bulb. These observations show that the nestin-expressing cells form the outer-root sheath. Results of the immunohistochemical staining showed that nestin, GFP, keratin 5/8, and keratin 15 colocalize in the hair follicle bulge cells, outer-root sheath cells, and basal cells of the sebaceous glands.

BACKGROUND: The composition of the basement membrane zone (BMZ) or dermal-epidermal junction in the interfollicular skin has been well documented. However, little is known about the BMZ or connective tissue-epithelial junction along the hair follicle. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the BMZ antigens in the interfollicular epidermis are also present in the BMZ of the anagen hair follicle and to compare whether the expression and distribution of the BMZ components vary between the interfollicular epidermis and the anagen follicle and within different regions of the hair follicle. METHODS: Longitudinal cryostat sections of scalp margin specimens from four adult patients undergoing cosmetic surgery, and without known pathology were stained with a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to different BMZ constituents using standard indirect immunofluorescence. RESULTS: All the BMZ antigens found in the normal interfollicular epidermis were expressed in the anagen follicle ; however, there were regional variations in the intensity and patterns of fluorescence. All the antigens were expressed in a continuous linear pattern along the BMZ of the interfollicular skin, the infundibulum, and the middle part of the hair follicle. Differences were observed in the lower follicle and the hair bulb. There was continuous expression throughout the BMZ of the follicle of laminin-1 and collagen IV, but in contrast, expression of other antigens decreased down the lower follicle. There was weak or even negative staining with antibodies to alpha 6 beta 4 integrin, laminin-5, anchoring filaments, and type VII collagen in the outer aspect of the bulb compared with the hair papilla. In addition, there were special patterns observed along the bilateral middle and lower follicle. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the common embryological origin between the interfollicular epidermis and the hair follicle, there is variation in the expression of the BMZ antigens. This may be explained by the histological specialization and functional requirements that reflect the dynamic hair growth cycle.",

This immune privilege is chiefly characterized by a very low level of expression of MHC class Ia antigens and by the local production of potent immunosuppressive agents, such as alpha-MSH and TGF-beta1. We discuss the putative functions of immune privilige of the anagen hair bulb, favoring the view that immune privilege serves mainly to sequester anagen-and/or melanogenesis-associated autoantigens from immune recognition by autoreactive CD8 + T cells. On this basis, we develop how the \" \" immune privilege collapse model \" \" of alopecia areata pathogenesis was conceived. In our discussion of the clinical implications of immune privilege, we outline the currently available evidence in support of this still hypothetical scenario to explain the initiation, progression, and termination of alopecia areata lesions. We review the most recent evidence from our laboratory that alpha-MSH, IGF-1, and TGF-beta1 can downregulate IFN-gamma-induced ectopic MHC class I expression in human anagen hair bulbs in vitro. Finally, we suggest that hair follicle-derived alpha-MSH, IGF-gamma, and TGF-beta1 form part of a constitutively active \" \" IP restoration machinery \" \" of the anagen hair bulb, which we propose to be recruited whenever the hair follicle suffers immune injury. Finally, we sketch some particularly promising avenues for future investigation into the far too long ignored hair follicle immune privilege. \"",

The embryonic mammary gland and hair follicle are both derived from the ventral ectoderm, and their development depends on a number of common fundamental developmental pathways. While the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is required for hair follicle morphogenesis, the role of this pathway during embryonic mammary gland development remains undetermined. We demonstrate here that, unlike the hair follicle, both Shh and Ihh are expressed in the developing embryonic mouse mammary rudiment as early as E12. 5. In Shh (-/-) embryos, hair follicle development becomes arrested at an early stage, while the mammary rudiment, which continues to express Ihh, develops in a manner indistinguishable from that of wild-type littermates. The five pairs of mammary buds in Shh (-/-) female embryos exhibit normal branching morphogenesis at E16. 5, forming a rudimentary ductal structure identical to wild-type embryonic mammary glands. We further demonstrate that loss of Hh signaling causes altered cyclin D1 expression in the embryonic dermal mesenchyme. Specifically, cyclin D1 is expressed at E14. 5 principally in the condensed mesenchymal cells of the presumptive hair follicles and in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells of the mammary rudiments in wild-type and Shh-deficient embryos. By E18. 5, robust cyclin D1 expression is maintained in mammary rudiments of both wild-type and Shh-deficient embryos. In hair follicles of wild-type embryos by E18. 5, cyclin D1 expression switches to follicular epithelial cells. In contrast, strong cyclin D1 expression is observed principally in the mesenchymal cells of arrested hair follicles in Shh (-/-) embryos at E18. 5. These data reveal that, despite the common embryonic origin of hair follicles and mammary glands, distinct patterns of Hh-family expression occur in these two tissues. Furthermore, these data suggest that cyclin D1 expression in the embryonic hair follicle is mediated by both Hh-independent and Hh-dependent mechanisms.",

This review focuses on the recent identification of two novel neural crest-derived cells in the adult mammalian hair follicle, pluripotent stem cells, and Merkel cells. Wnt1-cre/R26R compound transgenic mice, which in the periphery express beta-galactosidase in a neural crest-specific manner, were used to trace neural crest cells. Neural crest cells invade the facial epidermis as early as embryonic day 9. 5. Neural crest-derived cells are present along the entire extent of the whisker follicle. This includes the bulge area, an epidermal niche for keratinocyte stem cells, as well as the matrix at the base of the hair follicle. We have determined by in vitro clonal analysis that the bulge area of the adult whisker follicle contains pluripotent neural crest stem cells. In culture, beta-galactosidase-positive cells emigrate from bulge explants, identifying them as neural crest-derived cells. When these cells are resuspended and grown in clonal culture, they give rise to colonies that contain multiple differentiated cell types, including neurons, Schwann cells, smooth muscle cells, pigment cells, chondrocytes, and possibly other types of cells. This result provides evidence for the pluripotentiality of the clone-forming cell. Serial cloning showed that bulge-derived neural crest cells undergo self-renewal, which identifies them as stem cells. Pluripotent neural crest cells are also localized in the back skin hair of adult mice. The bulge area of the whisker follicle is surrounded by numerous Merkel cells, which together with innervating nerve endings form slowly adapting mechanoreceptors that transduce steady skin indentation. Merkel cells express beta-galactosidase in double transgenic mice, which confirms their neural crest origin. Taken together, our data indicate that the epidermis of the adult hair follicle contains pluripotent neural crest stem cells, termed epidermal neural crest stem cells (eNCSCs), and one newly identified neural crest derivative, the Merkel cell. The intrinsic high degree of plasticity of eNCSCs and the fact that they are easily accessible in the skin make them attractive candidates for diverse autologous cell therapy strategies.",

BMPs exert their biological effects via using BMP-Smad and BMP-MAPK intracellular pathways. The magnitude and specificity of BMP signaling are regulated by a large number of modulators operating on several levels (extracellular, cytoplasmic, nuclear). In developing and postnatal skin, BMPs, their receptors, and BMP antagonists show stringent spatio-temporal expressions patterns to achieve proper regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in the epidermis and in the hair follicle. Genetic studies assert an essential role for BMP signaling in the control of cell differentiation and apoptosis in developing epidermis, as well as in the regulation of key steps of hair follicle development (initiation, cell fate decision, cell lineage differentiation). In postnatal hair follicles, BMP signaling plays an important role in controlling the initiation of the growth phase and is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis-driven hair follicle involution.

Hair follicle (HF) development is the result of neuroectodermal-mesodermal interactions, and can be divided into morphologically distinguishable stages (induction, organogenesis and cytodifferentiation). The spacing, polarity and differentiation patterns of HFs are driven by interacting, self-assembling gradients of inhibitors and activators, which are established jointly by the skin epithelium and mesenchyme. For HF development to occur, the dominant-negative influence of inhibitors of the HF differentiation pathway must be locally counteracted by specific antagonists and/or overriden by stimulators of hair placode formation. Once a mesenchymal condensate of inductive fibroblasts has formed, it takes over control of most subsequent steps of HF organogenesis and of epithelial stem cell differentiation into distinct lineages. In this review we introduce the morphological characteristics, major underlying principles and molecular key players that control HF development. The focus is on recent insights into the molecular interactions leading to hair follicle induction, and we close with synthesizing a corresponding working hypothesis.",

BACKGROUND: Preservation of hair follicle units for the purpose of delayed transplant will help us graft thousands of hair grafts at one session, even in a clinic with fewer assistants and less equipment. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate and compare the viability of hair follicle units preserved at 0 and 4 degrees C for various periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell cultures and transplant of hair follicle units into athymic mice were performed. RESULTS: Outer root sheath cells could be cultivated in 96% (0 degrees C group) and 92% (4 degrees C group) of the hair follicles after 24 hours of preservation, whereas 85% (0 degrees C group) and 79% (4 degrees C group) of the follicles implanted into the mice regrew well after the same period of preservation. Then, in both the 0 degrees C and the 4 degrees C group, these rates decreased significantly with length of preservation in cell cultures and mice transplant ; however, 0 degrees C seems better than 4 degrees C for preservation of grafts (p <. 05). CONCLUSION: Grafts are better preserved at 0 degrees C instead of 4 degrees C. When delayed transplant is an option, it should be completed within 24 hours and no later than 48 hours.",

BACKGROUND: Age-related reduction in hair is seen in the axillary and pubic regions as well as the scalp ; however, it has not been investigated qualitatively on the scalp. Horizontally sectioned scalp biopsy is an ideal tool to investigate the impact of advancing age on scalp hair follicle density and morphology. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of age and follicle miniaturization on total hair count in 1666 horizontally sectioned mid-scalp biopsies from 928 women aged between 13 and 84 years with hair loss. METHODS: SETTING: Specialist hair loss referral clinic in a teaching hospital. DESIGN: Analysis of data set. Methods: All scalp biopsies were 4 mm in diameter and taken from the crown. Miniaturization was assessed by calculating the ratio of terminal to vellus-like hairs (T/V) at the mid-isthmus level and considered significant if the ratio was < or = 4: 1. Fibrosis was documented when present. Linear regression was used to examine the association between total hair count, age and miniaturization. RESULTS: The average number of hair follicles per biopsy was 39. 6 (SD +/-10. 8). A highly significant negative association (P < 0. 0001) was found between age and total follicle number, although the predictive value of age in total hair count was found to be small [root error mean square (R2) < 2%]. Controlling for T/V < or = 4: 1, the association was weakened, but remained significant. The relationship unconfounded by T/V < or = 4: 1 shows that for every additional year of ageing, 0. 077 total hair follicles (0. 22%) are lost per biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Age and follicular miniaturization were found to be extremely weak predictors of total hair count in women with hair loss.",

    "text": "A role of melatonin in neuroectodermal-mesodermal interactions: the hair follicle synthesizes melatonin and expresses functional melatonin receptors. Since mammalian skin expresses the enzymatic apparatus for melatonin synthesis, it may be an extrapineal site of melatonin synthesis. However, evidence is still lacking that this is really the case in situ. Here, we demonstrate melatonin-like immunoreactivity (IR) in the outer root sheath (ORS) of mouse and human hair follicles (HFs), which corresponds to melatonin, as shown by radioimmunoassay and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The melatonin concentration in organ-cultured mouse skin, mouse vibrissae follicles, and human scalp HFs far exceeds the respective melatonin serum level and is significantly increased ex vivo by stimulation with norepinephrine (NE), the key stimulus for pineal melatonin synthesis. By real-time PCR, transcripts for the melatonin membrane receptor MT2 and for the nuclear mediator of melatonin signaling, retinoid orphan receptor alpha (ROR) alpha, are detectable in murine back skin. Transcript levels for these receptors fluctuate in a hair cycle-dependent manner, and are maximal during apoptosis-driven HF regression (catagen). Melatonin may play a role in hair cycle regulation, since its receptors (MT2 and RORalpha) are expressed in murine skin in a hair cycle-dependent manner, and because it inhibits keratinocyte apoptosis and down-regulates ERalpha expression. Therefore, the HF is both, a prominent extrapineal melatonin source, and an important peripheral melatonin target tissue. Regulated intrafollicular melatonin synthesis and signaling may play a previously unrecognized role in the endogenous controls of hair growth, for example, by modulating keratinocyte apoptosis during catagen and by desensitizing the HF to estrogen signaling. As a prototypic neuroectodermal-mesodermal interaction model, the HF can be exploited for dissecting the obscure role of melatonin in such interactions in peripheral tissues.",

Epimorphin is representative of a unique class of stromal membrane-anchored proteins that plays distinct functions depending on its membrane topology.

Previous study identified its functional domain (the pep7 domain: SIEQSCDQDE) for hair follicular morphogenesis followed by the successful generation of a chemically modified active peptide. Here, we report optimization of this peptide by the introduction of sequential mutations and subsequent structural determination. We found that three residues from the C-terminus are dispensable, and alternation of the seventh amino acid to an Alanine residue enhanced activity. To favour the biologically active conformation, epsilon-Acp (NH (CH (2)) (5) CO) linked to a Cysteine residue was connected at the N-terminus followed by the introduction of an intramolecular disulphide bridge, the modification process of which could be included in the peptide synthesis. The obtained modified peptide, termed ' EPM (epimorphin-derived) peptide ', has a Mw of 950 Da and exerts an inductive effect on hair follicle regeneration at a concentration of approximately 0. 00001% or even lower.

In skin and hair research, drug targeting to the hair follicle is of great interest in the treatment of skin diseases. The aim of this study is to visualize on-line the diffusion processes of a model fluorophore into the hair follicle at different depths using fresh human scalp skin and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Up to a depth of 500 microm in the skin, a fast increase of fluorescence is observed in the gap followed by accumulation of the dye in the hair cuticle. Penetration was also observed via the stratum corneum and the epidermis. Little label reached depths greater than 2000 microm. Fat cells accumulated the label fastest, followed by the cuticular area and the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. Sweat glands revealed very low staining, whereas the bulb at a depth of 4000 microm was visualized only by autofluorescence. From this study, we conclude that on-line visualization is a promising technique to access diffusion processes in deep skin layers even on a cellular level. Furthermore, we conclude that the gap and the cuticle play an important role in the initial diffusion period with the label in the cuticle originating from the gap.",

The discovery of long-lived epithelial stem cells in the bulge region of the hair follicle led to the hypothesis that epidermal renewal and epidermal repair after wounding both depend on these cells. To determine whether bulge cells are necessary for epidermal renewal, here we have ablated these cells by targeting them with a suicide gene encoding herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) using a Keratin 1-15 (Krt1-15) promoter. We show that ablation leads to complete loss of hair follicles but survival of the epidermis. Through fate-mapping experiments, we find that stem cells in the hair follicle bulge do not normally contribute cells to the epidermis which is organized into epidermal proliferative units, as previously predicted. After epidermal injury, however, cells from the bulge are recruited into the epidermis and migrate in a linear manner toward the center of the wound, ultimately forming a marked radial pattern. Notably, although the bulge-derived cells acquire an epidermal phenotype, most are eliminated from the epidermis over several weeks, indicating that bulge stem cells respond rapidly to epidermal wounding by generating short-lived ' transient amplifying ' cells responsible for acute wound repair. Our findings have implications for both gene therapy and developing treatments for wounds because it will be necessary to consider epidermal and hair follicle stem cells as distinct populations.",

Melanin synthesis in the hair follicle (HF) is strictly coupled to the growth stage of the hair cycle and is interrupted during follicle regression (catagen) and resting. Using tyrosine-related protein 2 (Trp) 2-LacZ transgenic mice as a model, we show that distinct melanocyte subpopulations of the HF display distinct patterns of apoptosis and survival during catagen. Melanocytes located in the outer root sheath express Bcl-2 and are TUNEL-negative. Part of the pigment-producing melanocytes located above the follicular papilla expresses Fas, TUNEL, and is likely to undergo apoptosis, whereas the other part of these melanocytes expresses c-kit, Bcl-2, and becomes visible in the follicular papilla. During late catagen, TUNEL and Ki-67 negative melanocytes expressing Bcl-2 are seen in the secondary germ of the HF. Lack of proliferation in the follicular melanocytes during catagen suggests that secondary hair germ of late catagen HF is most likely repopulated by melanocytes arising from the outer root sheath or follicular papilla of early/mid-catagen HF. Taken together, these data suggest a possible scenario and mechanisms of the remodeling of the follicular pigmentary unit during HF anagen-catagen-telogen transition and may be used for the establishing in vivo models for pharmacological modulation of melanocyte apoptosis and survival during the hair cycle.",

The prototypic pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL) exerts a wide variety of bioregulatory effects in mammals and is also found in extrapituitary sites, including murine skin. Here, we show by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistology that, contrary to a previous report, human skin and normal human scalp hair follicles (HFs), in particular, express both PRL and PRL receptors (PRL-R) at the mRNA and protein level. PRL and PRL-R immunoreactivity can be detected in the epithelium of human anagen VI HFs, while the HF mesenchyme is negative. During the HF transformation from growth (anagen) to apoptosis-driven regression (catagen), PRL and PRL-R immunoreactivity appear up-regulated. Treatment of organ-cultured human scalp HFs with high-dose PRL (400 ng/ml) results in a significant inhibition of hair shaft elongation and premature catagen development, along with reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of hair bulb keratinocytes (Ki-67/terminal dUTP nick-end labeling immunohistomorphometry). This shows that PRL receptors, expressed in HFs, are functional and that human skin and human scalp HFs are both direct targets and sources of PRL. Our data suggest that PRL acts as an autocrine hair growth modulator with catagen-promoting functions and that the hair growth-inhibitory effects of PRL demonstrated here may underlie the as yet ill-understood hair loss in patients with hyper-prolactinemia.",

Previous studies have shown that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP ; also known as parathyroid hormone-like peptide, Pthlh) is produced by mammary epithelial cells and acts on surrounding mesenchymal cells to promote their differentiation into a mammary-specific dense mesenchyme. As a result of PTHrP signaling, the mammary mesenchyme supports mammary epithelial cell fate, initiates ductal development and patterns the overlying nipple sheath. In this report, we demonstrate that PTHrP acts, in part, by sensitizing mesenchymal cells to BMP signaling. PTHrP upregulates BMP receptor 1A expression in the mammary mesenchyme, enabling it to respond to BMP4, which is expressed within mesenchymal cells underlying the ventral epidermis during mammary bud formation. We demonstrate that BMP signaling is important for outgrowth of normal mammary buds and that BMP4 can rescue outgrowth of PTHrP (-/-) mammary buds. In addition, the combination of PTHrP and BMP signaling is responsible for upregulating Msx2 gene expression within the mammary mesenchyme, and disruption of the Msx2 gene rescues the induction of hair follicles on the ventral surface of mice overexpressing PTHrP in keratinocytes (K14-PTHrP). Our data suggest that PTHrP signaling sensitizes the mammary mesenchyme to the actions of BMP4, triggering outgrowth of the mammary buds and inducing MSX2 expression, which, in turn, leads to lateral inhibition of hair follicle formation within the developing nipple sheath.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of stable transfection of human hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) gene into fibroblasts cells and the effects of supernatant from the transfected cell culture on hair follicle cells. METHODS: PcDNA-HIF1alpha was stably transfected into fibroblasts cells with lipofectamine 2000. Expression of HIF-1alpha was observed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. The supernatant was obtained to detect the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by ELISA. The mRNA expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was detected by RT-PCR. MTT was used to detect the activity of fibroblasts cells and dermal sheath cells added with supernatant. RESULTS: PcDNA-HIF1alpha was successfully transfected into fibroblasts cells. HIF-1alpha could be detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. The expression of VEGF in the supernatant of cells transfected with PcDNA-HIF1alpha was detected. The mRNA expression of bFGF was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0. 01). MTT showed the activity of cells added with supernatant was enhanced (P < 0. 05).

    "text": "Bi-compartmental communication contributes to the opposite proliferative behavior of Notch1-deficient hair follicle and epidermal keratinocytes. Notch1-deficient epidermal keratinocytes become progressively hyperplastic and eventually produce tumors. By contrast, Notch1-deficient hair matrix keratinocytes have lower mitotic rates, resulting in smaller follicles with fewer cells. In addition, the ratio of melanocytes to keratinocytes is greatly reduced in hair follicles. Investigation into the underlying mechanism for these phenotypes revealed significant changes in the Kit, Tgfbeta and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways, which have not been previously shown to be downstream of Notch signaling. The level of Kitl (Scf) mRNA produced by Notch1-deficient follicular keratinocytes was reduced when compared with wild type, resulting in a decline in melanocyte population. Tgfbeta ligands were elevated in Notch1-deficient keratinocytes, which correlated with elevated expression of several targets, including the diffusible IGF antagonist Igfbp3 in the dermal papilla. Diffusible stromal targets remained elevated in the absence of epithelial Tgfbeta receptors, consistent with paracrine Tgfbeta signaling. Overexpression of Igf1 in the keratinocyte reversed the phenotype, as expected if Notch1 loss altered the IGF/insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) balance. Conversely, epidermal keratinocytes contained less stromal Igfbp4 and might thus be primed to experience an increase in IGF signaling as animals age. These results suggest that Notch1 participates in a bi-compartmental signaling network that controls homeostasis, follicular proliferation rates and melanocyte population within the skin.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of hair follicle dermal papilla cells (DPCs) on biological features of composite skin. METHODS: In the test group, xenogeneic acellular dermal matrix was employed as the frame, DPCs were seeded on the subcutaneous side, and epithelial stem cells onto the dermal papilla side of the dermal frame so as to construct a composite skin. In the control group, there was no DPC in the frame. The two kinds of composite skin were employed to cover skin defects on the back of the nude mice. Wound healing was observed 4 weeks after grafting and area was analyzed and contraction rate was calculated. The tissue samples in the grafted area were harvested for HE staining and the state of the composite skin was observed. The stress-strain curve of the sampled skin was measured, so as to calculate the maximal breaking power of the sample. The data were collected and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: HE staining indicated that the epithelial depth was increased (more than 10 layers of cells) in test group, with only 6-7 layers in control group. The skin contraction rate in test group on the 4th week after skin grafting (3. 94 +/-0. 013)% was much lower than that in control group (29. 07 +/-0. 018)% (P < 0. 05). It was indicated by biomechanical test that the stress-strain curve of the composite skin in the test group was closer to that of normal nude mice skin in comparison to that in control group. The maximal breaking force of the composite skin in test group was (1. 835 +/-0. 035) N (Newton), while that in control group was (1. 075 +/-0. 065) N (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of epidermis in composite skin was promoted by dermal DPCs seeded in the dermal matrix frame. As a result, there was less skin contraction in the composite skin with DPCs, so that the biological characteristics of the skin were improved.",

Hair follicles (HFs) enjoy a relative immune privilege (IP) that is characterized by downregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and local expression of potent immunosuppressants. Normally, natural killer (NK) cells attack cells with absent/low MHC class I expression. However, because few perifollicular NK cells are found around healthy human anagen HFs, we asked how HFs escape from NK cell attack. This study suggests that this happens via an active NK cell suppression. Alopecia areata (AA), an organ-specific autoimmune disease thought to result from a collapse of HF-IP, in contrast, shows striking defects in NK cell inhibition/containment. We show that the NK cell inhibitor macrophage migration inhibitory factor is strongly expressed by the HF epithelium, and very few CD56 (+)/NKG2D (+) NK cells are observed in and around normal anagen HFs compared to AA with prominent aggregations of CD56 (+)/NKG2D (+) NK around AA-HFs. By flow cytometry, many fewer NK function-activating receptors (NKG2D, NKG2C) and significantly more killer cell Ig-like receptors-2D2/2D3 were found to be expressed on peripheral blood CD56 (+) NK cells of healthy controls than on those of AA patients. In addition, only weak immunoreactivity for MHC class I chain-related A gene was observed in normal anagen HFs compared to AA. To our knowledge, this defect is previously unreported and must be taken into account in AA pathogenesis and its management.",

The role of stem cells in cancer formation and spreading has been established. As with normal tissue, the cancer stem cells need a special microenvironment to support their growth. This microenvironment may be represented by the tumor stroma. One of the possible ways of tumor stromal formation is the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tumor epithelium. Following this mechanism, stromal cells must share the basic genetic alterations with the tumor cells. In an attempt to create a system capable of testing some aspects of the mesenchymal cell-keratinocyte interactions, we studied the effects of the fibroblastoid mouse TC-1 cells that were prepared by the introduction of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) genes E6 and E7 to lung epithelial cells on the phenotype of normal human interfollicular and hair follicle keratinocytes. From this point of view, they may resemble stromal cells formed by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cells from HPV-induced squamous cell carcinoma. In contrast to 3T3 murine embryonic fibroblasts which were used as control cells, TC-1 cells influenced not only the size of the keratinocytes and the shape of their colonies, but also induced the expression of keratins 8 and 19 and vimentin. In conclusion, TC-1 cells exhibited a marked biological activity by influencing the behavior of the normal human follicular and intefollicular keratinocytes.

FDK primary cultures (atopic dermatitis, n = 11 ; non-atopic controls, n = 7) before and after interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment were used for microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR. Comparison of FDKs from atopic and non-atopic donors indicated that the former showed activated pathways with innate immunity and decreased pathways of cell growth, as indicated by increased NLRP2 expression and decreased DKK1 expression, respectively. Treatment with IFN-gamma induced the enhanced expression of IL32, IL1B, IL8, and CXCL1 in the cells from atopic donors compared to that in cells from non-atopic donors at 24 h after treatment. IL1B expression in FDKs after IFN-gamma treatment correlated with IL32 expression. We hypothesized that overexpression of IL32 in hair follicle keratinocytes of patients with atopic dermatitis would lead to the excessive production of pro-IL1beta and that the activation of IL1beta from pro-IL1beta by inflammasome complex, in which NLRP2 protein might be involved, would be augmented.

Biochemical, hematological and histological analyses were done. RESULTS: At the end of the experiment (15th day of VEGF treatment) efficacy was determined macroscopically by hair density dermatoscopy analysis, and microscopically by hair diameter analysis.

Anagen induction activity was examined by topical application of E. cava to the dorsal skin of C57BL/6 mice. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 expression was measured by reverse transcriptase PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: The proliferation activity was found to be highest for the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of E. cava (EAFE) in DPCs and in ORS cells. Treatment with EAFE resulted in elongation of the hair shaft in cultured human hair follicles, and promoted transition of the hair cycle from the telogen to the anagen phase in the dorsal skin of C57BL/6 mice. In addition, EAFE induced an increase in IGF-1 expression in DPCs. Dioxinodehydroeckol, a component of E. cava, induced elongation of the hair shaft, an increase in proliferation of DPCs and ORS cells, and an increase in expression of IGF-1 in DPCs. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that E. cava containing dioxinodehydroeckol promotes hair growth through stimulation of DPCs and ORS cells.",

Using the Hoeschst exclusion technique, originally described in the hematopoietic system, it has been possible to isolate a mouse keratinocyte cell population with characteristics of stem cells (side-population, SP). One of the main features of these SP is their ability to efflux antimitotic drugs as well as some specific dyes. This characteristic allows for SP cells to be isolated based upon their capacity to efflux the dye Hoechst 33342, through a mechanism driven by a membrane transporter, the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP1/ABCG2).

Wild-type cells are co-opted into new hair growths by beta-catenin mutant cells, which non-cell autonomously activate Wnt signaling within the neighboring wild-type cells via Wnt ligands.

In the present study, we worked with double homozygous we/we wal/wal mice which demonstrate symptoms closely resembling human alopecia. Using whole-mount preparations of epidermis of E18. 5 embryos we show that hair follicle defects can be revealed as early as during embryonic morphogenesis in these mutants. The number of hair follicles was reduced almost 1. 5-fold in mutant skin. The shape of the early stage small follicles was altered in mutant animals as compared to control ones. Additionally, follicles of mutant embryos were wider at the point of conjunction with interfollicular epidermis. We believe that the mutant mice studied represent a fascinating model to address the problem of hair loss. We demonstrated alterations in the morphogenesis of embryonic hair follicle in we/we wal/wal double homozygous mice developing alopecia postnatally.

Differentiation of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) into neurons and glial cells represents a promising cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. The hair follicle bulge area is reported as a putative source of new stem cell population for many years. In vitro studies have implicated neural differentiation of HFSCs. Here, we report the identification and purification of CD34 (+) cells from hair follicle by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). We next determined the cytotoxic effects of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) by using cell viability assays. Moreover, the neural differentiation potential of CD34 (+) cells was evaluated in the presence of RA, serum-free condition, and neural differentiation medium (NDM) treatments by using immunocytochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Our results showed that the isolated CD34 (+) stem cells were 12% of the total cells in the bulge area, and the neural cells derived from the stem cells expressed nestin, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Interestingly, all the neural induction media supported neuronal differentiation most effectively, but treatment with serum-free medium significantly increased the number of GFAP-positive glial cells. Moreover, increasing RA concentration (> = 10 muM) leads to increased cell death in the cells, but a lower concentration of RA (1 muM) treatment results in a decrease in CD34-expressing stem cells. These findings show an instructive neuronal effect of three neural induction media in HFSCs, indicating the important role of this induction media in the specification of the stem cells toward a neural phenotype.",

INTRODUCTION: In the field of skin tissue engineering, gelatin-chondroitin-6-sulfate-hyaluronic acid (Gel-C6S-HA) stents are a suitable bio skin substitute. The purpose was to investigate the effect of genetically-modified hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), combined with Gel-C6S-HA scaffolds, on the vascularization of tissue-engineered skin. METHODS: Three-dimensional (3D) Gel-C6S-HA scaffolds were prepared by freeze-drying. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 165 gene-modified rat HFSCs (rHFSCs) were inoculated into the scaffolds and cultured for 7 days. Two bilateral full-thickness skin defects were created on the back of 18 Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group A, HFSCs transduced with VEGF165 seeded onto Gel-C6S-HA scaffolds ; Group B, HFSCs transduced with empty vector seeded onto Gel-C6S-HA scaffolds ; Group C, Gel-C6S-HA scaffold only ; Group D, Vaseline gauze dressing. These compositions were implanted onto the defects and harvested at 7, 14 and 21 days. Wound healing was assessed and compared among groups according to hematoxylin-eosin staining, CD31 expression, alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) immunohistochemistry, and microvessel density (MVD) count, to evaluate the new blood vessels. RESULTS: SEM revealed the Gel-C6S-HA scaffold was spongy and 3D, with an average pore diameter of 133. 23 +-43. 36 mum. Cells seeded on scaffolds showed good adherent growth after 7 days culture. No significant difference in rHFSC morphology, adherence and proliferative capacity was found before and after transfection (P > 0. 05). After 14 and 21 days, the highest rate of wound healing was observed in Group A (P < 0. 05). Histological and immunological examination showed that after 21 days, MVD also reached a maximum in Group A (P < 0. 05). Therefore, the number of new blood vessels formed within the skin substitutes was greatest in Group A, followed by Group B. In Group C, only trace amounts of mature subcutaneous blood vessels were observed, and few subcutaneous tissue cells migrated into the scaffolds. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue-engineered skin constructs, using 3D Gel-C6S-HA scaffolds seeded with VEGF165-modified rHFSCs, resulted in promotion of angiogenesis during wound healing and facilitation of vascularization in skin substitutes. This may be a novel approach for tissue-engineered skin substitutes.",

    "text": "Resting no more: re-defining telogen, the maintenance stage of the hair growth cycle. The hair follicle (HF) represents a prototypic ectodermal-mesodermal interaction system in which central questions of modern biology can be studied. A unique feature of these stem-cell-rich mini-organs is that they undergo life-long, cyclic transformations between stages of active regeneration (anagen), apoptotic involution (catagen), and relative proliferative quiescence (telogen). Due to the low proliferation rate and small size of the HF during telogen, this stage was conventionally thought of as a stage of dormancy. However, multiple lines of newly emerging evidence show that HFs during telogen are anything but dormant. Here, we emphasize that telogen is a highly energy-efficient default state of the mammalian coat, whose function centres around maintenance of the hair fibre and prompt responses to its loss. While actively retaining hair fibres with minimal energy expenditure, telogen HFs can launch a new regeneration cycle in response to a variety of stimuli originating in their autonomous micro-environment (including its stem cell niche) as well as in their external tissue macro-environment. Regenerative responses of telogen HFs change as a function of time and can be divided into two sub-stages: early ' refractory ' and late ' competent ' telogen. These changing activities are reflected in hundreds of dynamically regulated genes in telogen skin, possibly aimed at establishing a fast response-signalling environment to trauma and other disturbances of skin homeostasis. Furthermore, telogen is an interpreter of circadian output in the timing of anagen initiation and the key stage during which the subsequent organ regeneration (anagen) is actively prepared by suppressing molecular brakes on hair growth while activating pro-regenerative signals. Thus, telogen may serve as an excellent model system for dissecting signalling and cellular interactions that precede the active ' regenerative mode ' of tissue remodeling. This revised understanding of telogen biology also points to intriguing new therapeutic avenues in the management of common human hair growth disorders.",

Hair follicles (HFs) undergo cycles of degeneration (catagen), rest (telogen), and regeneration (anagen) phases. Anagen begins when the hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) obtain sufficient activation cues to overcome suppressive signals, mainly the BMP pathway, from their niche cells. Here, we unveil that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling is activated in HFSCs, which coincides with the HFSC activation at the telogen-to-anagen transition. By using both an inducible conditional gene targeting strategy and a pharmacological inhibition method to ablate or inhibit mTOR signaling in adult skin epithelium before anagen initiation, we demonstrate that HFs that cannot respond to mTOR signaling display significantly delayed HFSC activation and extended telogen. Unexpectedly, BMP signaling activity is dramatically prolonged in mTOR signaling-deficient HFs. Through both gain-and loss-of-function studies in vitro, we show that mTORC1 signaling negatively affects BMP signaling, which serves as a main mechanism whereby mTORC1 signaling facilitates HFSC activation. Indeed, in vivo suppression of BMP by its antagonist Noggin rescues the HFSC activation defect in mTORC1-null skin. Our findings reveal a critical role for mTOR signaling in regulating stem cell activation through counterbalancing BMP-mediated repression during hair regeneration.",

Electroepilation is a commonly performed method of hair removal that is so-called \" \" permanent \" \" ; however, there is a paucity of histological studies of the effects of radiofrequency (RF) on hair follicles. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to observe the destruction of human hair follicles and surrounding tissue after the treatment with 27. 12-MHz RF, with more attention paid to the thermal destruction of bulge and bulb/dermal papilla. METHODS: Human scalp specimens obtained during face-lift surgery were treated with 27. 12-MHz RF. The probe tip was inserted into hair follicle, RF current was applied, and treated specimens were processed for histological analysis. RESULTS: Significant damages were observed on treated hair follicles. Thermal damage was lance-shaped and extended over several hundred micrometers (100-400 mum). The location of destruction areas varied, likely depending on the point of insertion of the probe. The epidermis remained intact. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the general mechanism of thermolysis is to generate damage to cells and tissues surrounding the insertion point of the filament. The results suggest that if the insertion point is close to the bulge region, there is a risk to destroy hair follicle epithelial stem cells. \"",

Using mouse gene expression microarray analysis, we obtained dynamic expression profiles of the whole genome in a depilation-induced hair growth mouse model. S100A3 expression increased during the anagen phase and returned to normal during the telogen phase. The effects of S100A3 blockade on the hair growth cycle were examined in mice after subcutaneous injection of an anti-mouse S100A3 antibody. Protein localization of S100A3 was confined to the hair shafts during the anagen phase and the sebaceous glands during the telogen phase. S100A3 blockade delayed hair follicle entry into the anagen phase, decreased hair elongation, and reduced the number of hair follicles in the subcutis, which correlated with the downregulated expression of hair growth induction-related genes in vivo. The present study demonstrates that anti-S100A3 antibody inhibits mouse hair growth, suggesting that S100A3 can be used as a target for hair loss treatment.",

    "text": "Identification of a new plant extract for androgenic alopecia treatment using a non-radioactive human hair dermal papilla cell-based assay. BACKGROUND: Androgenic alopecia (AGA) is a major type of human scalp hair loss, which is caused by two androgens: testosterone (T) and 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5alpha-DHT). Both androgens bind to the androgen receptor (AR) and induce androgen-sensitive genes within the human hair dermal papilla cells (HHDPCs), but 5alpha-DHT exhibits much higher binding affinity and potency than T does in inducing the involved androgen-sensitive genes. Changes in the induction of androgen-sensitive genes during AGA are caused by the over-production of 5alpha-DHT by the 5alpha-reductase (5alpha-R) enzyme ; therefore, one possible method to treat AGA is to inhibit this enzymatic reaction. METHODS: RT-PCR was used to identify the presence of the 5alpha-R and AR within HHDPCs. A newly developed AGA-relevant HHDPC-based assay combined with non-radioactive thin layer chromatography (TLC) detection was used for screening crude plant extracts for the identification of new 5alpha-R inhibitors. RESULTS: HHDPCs expressed both 5alpha-R type 1 isoform of the enzyme (5alpha-R1) and AR in all of the passages used in this study. Among the thirty tested extracts, Avicennia marina (AM) displayed the highest inhibitory activity at the final concentration of 10 mug/ml, as the production of 5alpha-DHT decreased by 52% (IC50 = 9. 21 +-0. 38 mug/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Avicennia marina (AM) was identified as a potential candidate for the treatment of AGA based on its 5alpha-R1-inhibitory activity.",

BACKGROUND: Hominis Placenta (HP) known as a restorative medicine in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has been widely applied in the clinics of Korea and China as an anti-aging agent to enhance the regeneration of tissue. This study was conducted to investigate whether topical treatment of HP promotes hair regrowth in the animal model. METHODS: The dorsal hairs of 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were depilated to synchronize hair follicles to the anagen phase. HP was applied topically once a day for 15 days. Hair growth was evaluated visually and microscopically. The incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7) in dorsal skin tissue was examined by immunohistochemical analysis. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure the mRNA expression of FGF-7. RESULTS: HP exhibited potent hair growth-promoting activity in C57BL/6 mice. Gross examination indicated that HP markedly increased hair regrowth as well as hair density and diameter. Histologic analysis showed that HP treatment enhanced the anagen induction of hair follicles. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that BrdU incorporation and the expressions of PCNA were increased by treatment of HP. HP treatment significantly increased the expression of FGF-7, which plays pivotal roles to maintain anagen phase both protein and mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that HP has a potent hair growth-promoting activity ; therefore, it may be a good candidate for the treatment of alopecia.",

Billions of dollars are annually invested in pharmaceutical industry and cosmetic sector with intent to develop new drugs and treatment strategies for alopecia. Because the hair looks an important characteristic of humans-an effective appendage in perception, expression of beauty, and preservation of self-esteem-the global market for hair loss treatment products is exponentially increasing. However, current methods to treat hair loss endure yet multiple challenges, such as unfavorable outcomes, nonpermanent and patient-dependent results, as well as unpredictable impacts, which limit their application. Over recent years, remarkable advances in the fields of regenerative medicine and hair tissue engineering have raised new hopes for introducing novel cell-based approaches to treat hair loss. Through cell-based approaches, it is possible to produce hair-like structures in the laboratory setting or manipulate cells in their native niche (in vivo lineage reprogramming) to reconstruct the hair follicle. However, challenging issues still exist with the functionality of cultured human hair cells, the proper selection of nonhair cell sources in cases of shortage of donor hair, and the development of defined culture conditions. Moreover, in the case of in vivo lineage reprogramming, selecting appropriate induction factors and their efficient delivery to guide resident cells into a hair fate-with the aim of reconstructing functional hair-still needs further explorations. In this study, we highlight recent advances and current challenges in hair loss treatment using cell-based approaches and provide novel insights for crucial steps, which must be taken into account to develop reproducible, safe, and efficient cell-based treatment.",

To determine whether the effects of low-dose-rate gamma (gamma) irradiation are identifiable in the regeneration of murine hair follicles, we irradiated whole bodies of C57BL/10JHir mice in the first telogen phase of the hair cycle with 137Cs gamma-rays. The mice were examined for effects on hair follicles, including number, morphology, and pigmentation in the second anagen phase. Effects of gamma-radiation on melanocyte stem cells were also investigated by the indirect immunolabeling of tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP2). Irradiated skin showed a decrease in hair follicle density and the induction of curved hair follicles along with the presence of white hairs and hypopigmented hair bulbs. There was a small, but not significant, change in the number of TRP2-positive melanocyte stem cells in the hair bulge region of the irradiated skin. These results suggest that low-dose rate gamma-irradiation does not deplete melanocyte stem cells, but can damage stem cells and progenitors for both keratinocytes and melanocytes, thereby affecting the structure and pigmentation of regenerated hair follicles in the 2nd anagen phase.",

To explore the molecular mechanisms of the formation of high-quality brush hair, High-throughput RNA-Seq technology was used to compare skin samples from Yangtze River Delta White Goats that produce high-quality hair and non high-quality hair for identification of the important genes and related pathways that might influence the hair quality traits. The results showed that 295 genes were expressed differentially between the goats with higher and lower hair quality, respectively. Of those genes, 132 were up-regulated, 62 were down-regulated, and 101 were expressed exclusively in the goats with high-quality brush hair.

Histologically PEMs are heavily pigmented spindled and epithelioid dermal melanocytic tumors with infiltrative borders, however, their origin remains unclear. Stem cells for the epidermis and hair follicle are located in the bulge area of the hair follicle with the potential to differentiate into multiple lineages. Multiple cutaneous carcinomas, including follicular cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (FSCC), are thought to arise from stem cells in the follicular bulge. We present two cases of PEM/ATM in a 63 year-old male on the scalp with follicular origin and a 72 year-old female on the upper back arising in an intradermal nevus. Biopsy of both cases revealed a proliferation of heavily pigmented dermal nests of melanocytes with atypia. The Case 1 tumor was in continuation with the outer root sheath of the hair follicle in the bulge region. Case 2 arose in an intradermal melanocytic nevus.

The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of red ginseng oil (RGO) and its major components on hair re-growth using testosterone (TES)-induced delay of anagen entry in C57BL/6 mice and their mechanisms of action. Seven-week-old C57BL/6 mice were daily treated with TES for 1 h prior to topical application of 10% RGO, 1% linoleic acid (LA), 1% beta-sitosterol (SITOS), or 1% bicyclo (10. 1. 0) tridec-1-ene (BICYCLO) once a day for 28 days. Hair regenerative capacity was significantly restored by treatment of RGO and its major compounds in the TES-treated mice. Histological analysis showed that RGO along with LA and SITOS but not BICYCLO promoted hair growth through early inducing anagen phase that was delayed by TES in mice. Treatment of mice with RGO, LA, or SITOS up-regulated Wnt/beta-catenin and Shh/Gli pathways-mediated expression of genes such as beta-catenin, Lef-1, Sonic hedgehog, Smoothened, Gli-1, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin E in the TES-treated mice. In addition, RGO and its major components reduced the protein level of TGF-beta but enhanced the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. These results suggest that RGO is a potent novel therapeutic natural product for treatment of androgenic alopecia possibly through hair re-growth activity of its major components such as LA and SITOS.",

Male sex hormones-androgens-regulate male physique development. Without androgen signaling, genetic males appear female. During puberty, increasing androgens harness the hair follicle ' s unique regenerative ability to replace many tiny vellus hairs with larger, darker terminal hairs (e. g., beard). Follicle response is epigenetically varied: some remain unaffected (e. g., eyelashes) or are inhibited, causing balding. How sex steroid hormones alter such developmental processes is unclear, despite high incidences of hormone-driven cancer, hirsutism, and alopecia. Unfortunately, existing development models are not androgen sensitive. Here, we use hair follicles to establish an androgen-responsive human organ culture model. We show that women ' s intermediate facial follicles respond to men ' s higher androgen levels by synthesizing more hair over several days, unlike donor-matched, androgen-insensitive, terminal follicles. We demonstrate that androgen receptors-androgen-activated gene transcription regulators-are required and are present in vivo within these follicles. This is the first human organ that involves multiple cell types that responds appropriately to hormones in prolonged culture, in a way which mirrors its natural behavior. Thus, intermediate hair follicles offer a hormone-switchable human model with exceptional, unique availability of genetically identical, but epigenetically hormone-insensitive, terminal follicles. This should enable advances in understanding sex steroid hormone signaling, gene regulation, and developmental and regenerative systems and facilitate better therapies for hormone-dependent disorders.-Miranda, B.

Prostanoids, including prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), are a family of lipid-derived autacoids that modulate many physiological systems and pathological contexts. Prostanoids are generated by sequential metabolism of arachidonic acid, catalysed by cyclo-oxygenase, to PGH2, which is then converted to PGD2, PGE2, PGF2alpha, PGI2 and TXA2, catalysed by their specific synthases. Recent evidence suggests that prostanoids play a role in regulating hair growth. The PGF2alpha analogue is Food and Drug Administration-approved in the US and routinely used to enhance the growth of human eyelashes. PGE2 is reported to protect from radiation-induced hair loss in mice. Conversely, PGD2 inhibits hair growth.

    "text": "5alpha-Reductase isozymes and aromatase mRNA levels in plucked hair from young women with female pattern hair loss. Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is an important hair disorder, especially when young women are affected. However, pharmacological treatments are not successful in all women. Androgens, especially dihydrotestosterone (DHT), may play a role in FPHL, but many women with this disorder have normal serum androgen levels. It therefore appears that hair follicle levels of DHT depend on in situ testosterone (T) metabolism. Because T can be converted to DHT or estradiol (E2) by 5alpha-reductase (5alpha-R) and aromatase, respectively, these enzymes would determine DHT and E2 concentrations and their ratio. We propose and apply a low-invasive, sensitive and precise method for the absolute quantification of mRNA levels of aromatase and 5alpha-R isozymes (type 1, type 2 and type 3) in plucked hair from young women with FPHL. Normoandrogenic women with FPHL and controls were studied. Plucked hair samples were obtained by trichogram from vertex scalp and mRNA levels quantified by real-time RT-PCR. We revealed for the first time the presence of 5alpha-R3 mRNA in human hair. Interestingly, one, two, or even three 5alpha-R isozymes were increased in some women with FPHL but not in others, which may explain the lack of response to 5alpha-R inhibitors in some FPHL cases. Aromatase mRNA levels were significantly lower in women with FPHL than in controls. It may therefore produce a reduction in oestrogen levels and an increase in the androgen/oestrogen ratio in hair. The proposed low-invasive technique offers a molecular aetiologic diagnosis of FPHL for the selection of more appropriate pharmacological treatments with early predicted effectiveness.",

Development of an appropriate method to evaluate drug disposition or targeting ability in hair follicles (HFs) is urgently needed in order to develop useful pharmaceutical products with pharmacological effects in HFs. In the present study, a cyanoacrylate biopsy (CB) method was used to measure drug disposition in HFs using a model hydrophilic drug, caffeine (CAF), and a lipophilic drug, 4-butylresorcinol (BR), in excised porcine skin. As a result, the height of HF replicas and the recovery ratio decreased with an increase in the application times of the CB method. HF replicas with a length of approximately 175 microm were obtained using a single application of the CB method. Drug distribution in the HF was detected even 5 min after topical application regardless of the lipophilicity of the drugs, although no drug disposition was observed in the deeper layers of the stratum corneum at the same time (5 min). Furthermore, significantly higher amounts of BR were observed in the stratum corneum and HF, compared with those of CAF. These results suggested that the CB method could be useful to evaluate the safety and efficacy as well as the disposition of topically applied chemicals, especially for HF-targeting drugs.",

In this study, we investigated the effects and the underlying mechanism of morroniside on hair growth and regulation of HF cycle transition. Morroniside treatment significantly enhanced outer root sheath cell (ORSC) proliferation and migration in vitro. Additionally, morroniside upregulated Wnt10b, beta-catenin and lef1. The enhanced ORSC proliferation and migration due to morroniside treatment were partly rescued by a Wnt/beta-catenin signaling inhibitor, DKK1. Furthermore, in a hair-induced mouse model, morroniside injection accelerated the onset of anagen and delayed HF catagen, as shown by histological examination. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway expression was upregulated in the HFs.

Here, we demonstrate a biomimetic approach for generation of human HFs within HSCs by recapitulating the physiological 3D organization of cells in the HF microenvironment using 3D-printed molds. Overexpression of Lef-1 in dermal papilla cells (DPC) restores the intact DPC transcriptional signature and significantly enhances the efficiency of HF differentiation in HSCs. Furthermore, vascularization of hair-bearing HSCs prior to engraftment allows for efficient human hair growth in immunodeficient mice.

A successful translation is the transplantation of scalp HFs into chronic wounds to promote healing. OBJECTIVE: To characterize scar formation and hair growth in nonhealing ulcers after transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nonhealing ulcers were treated with hair transplantation to promote wound healing. Hair follicles were harvested from the patient ' s scalp and inserted into the wound bed. Wound repair and hair growth were assessed clinically. Further analyses were performed in situ, using biopsies from the central and peripheral scar. RESULTS: Rapid wound closure and differences of scar quality and hair growth between the central and peripheral wound areas were observed: the periphery healed with no hair shaft survival and an almost scarless appearance, the center healed with a fibrotic scar, with some hair shaft growth. In situ analyses revealed differences in dermal remodeling and collagen formation between central and peripheral scar areas. CONCLUSION: Besides confirming the effectiveness of this therapy to promote wound healing in human skin, location-dependent disparities in scar quality and hair growth raise the intriguing question whether they are due to clinically important differences in mechanical forces and/or wound microenvironments between ulcer center and periphery.",

Dermal papilla (DP) plays a crucial role in regulating the growth and cycling of hair follicles. Lactoferrin (LF) exhibits a wide range of biological functions, including antimicrobial activity and growth regulation. However, its effect on DP and its role in hair growth remain unknown. In this study, we found that bovine LF (bLF) promoted the proliferation of DP cells and enhanced the phosphorylation of Erk and Akt. The bLF-mediated proliferation was significantly blocked by the Erk phosphorylation inhibitor PD98059 or the Akt phosphorylation inhibitor LY294002. Moreover, biotin-labeled bLF could bind to DP cells, and the binding was independent of lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1, a known LF receptor. Importantly, bLF stimulated hair growth in both young and aged mice. Moreover, we also found that bLF significantly induced the expression of Wnt signaling-related proteins, including Wnt3a, Wnt7a, Lef1, and beta-catenin. The bLF-mediated DP cell proliferation could be significantly reversed by the Wnt pathway inhibitor XAV939. Our findings suggest that bLF promotes hair growth in mice and stimulates proliferation of DP cells through Erk/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways. This study highlights a great potential of the use of bLF in developing drugs to treat hair loss.",

BACKGROUND: An adipose-derived stem cell-conditioned medium (ADSC-CM) reportedly exerts skin-rejuvenating and hair growth-promoting effects. In the therapeutic application of ADSC-CM for alopecia, changes to the interfollicular scalp remain unclear although some evidence has indicated hair growth-promoting effects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of ADSC-CM not only on hair follicles, but also on the interfollicular scalp. METHODS: Forty patients (21 men, 19 women ; age range, 23-74 years) with alopecia were treated by intradermal injection of ADSC-CM every month for 6 months. Eighty fixed sites on patients were investigated by trichograms, physiological examinations, and ultrasonographic examinations at 4 time points (before treatment and 2, 4, and 6 months after the initial treatment). RESULTS: Hair density and anagen hair rate increased significantly. As physiological parameters, transepidermal water loss value gradually increased, with significant differences at 4 and 6 months after the initial treatment, but hydration state of the stratum corneum and skin surface lipid level showed no obvious changes. As ultrasonographic parameters, dermal thickness and dermal echogenicity were increased significantly. CONCLUSION: Intradermal administration of ADSC-CM on the scalp has strong potential to provide regenerative effects for hair follicles and the interfollicular scalp.

Introduction: Hair growth-promoting herbal extract mixtures (4HGF) exhibits significant anti-inflammatory activities relevant to promoting hair growth ; however, its efficacy in patients with hair loss has been limited majorly due to its low penetration ability into hair follicles. Herein, we prepared hydrogels via dropwise addition of poly (gamma-glutamic acid) (PGA) solution containing 4HGF into chitosan (CS) solution, resulting in quick formation of ~ 400 nm-sized hydrogel particles through electrostatic interaction-derived ionic gelation with over 50% encapsulation efficiency of 4HGF (PGA-4HGF). Methods: The size and morphology of PGA-4HGF were characterized by TEM, SEM, and dynamic light scattering analyses. Encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of 4HGF within PGA-4HGF, as well as in vitro release profiles were determined by simply measuring the characteristic absorbance of 4HGF. Penetrating efficiency of PGA-4HGF was evaluated by tracking the respective fluorescence through model porcine skin with confocal laser microscope system. By treating PGA-4HGF on telogenic mice and dermal papilla cells (DPCs), we evaluated the size of hair bulbs in mice, as well as morphological changes in DPCs. Results: Negligible and sustained release of entrapped 4HGF from the hydrogel nanoparticles were observed under acidic and physiological pH conditions, respectively, which is quite advantageous to control their release and prolong their hair growth-promoting effect. The hydrogel nanoparticles were penetrable through the porcine skin after incubation with or without shaking. After treating telogenic mice and DPCs with PGA-4HGF, we detected enlargement of hair bulbs and remarkable shape changes, respectively, thereby showing its potential in induction of hair growth. Conclusion: These results suggest that the hydrogel nanoparticle formulation developed in this study can be employed as a potential approach for the preservation of hair growth-promoting compounds, their delivery of into hair follicles, and enhancing hair growth.",

Whisker HFs were isolated from Rex rabbits and cultured in vitro to measure hair shaft growth. Meanwhile, dermal papilla cells (DPCs) were isolated and cultured in vitro. Treatment with AdWnt10b or the Wnt/beta-Catenin Pathway inhibitor, XAV939, assessed the DPCs proliferation by CCK-8 assay. And the cell cycle was also analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that Wnt10b could promote elongation of the hair shaft, whereas XAV-939 treatment could eliminated this phenomenon. AdWnt10b treatment promoted the proliferation and induced G1/S transition of DPCs. AdWnt10b stimulation up-regulated beta-Catenin protein in DPCs. Inhibition of Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling by XAV-939 could decreased the basal and Wnt10b-enhanced proliferation of DPCs. And could also suppress the cell cycle progression in DPCs.

Inner Mongolia cashmere goats, as an important part of animal husbandry production, play an important role in animal fiber industry. In recent years, scientific research has made a lot of explorations on the molecular regulation mechanism of hair follicle cycle growth, but few studies have been reported on the development of cashmere hair in fetal period. This study was based on the completion of 21 skin samples of mRNA and miRNA sequencing in 7 fetal periods (45 days, 55 days, 65 days, 75 days, 95 days, 115 days and 135 days) of the Inner Mongolia Cashmere goat. The target genes of miRNA associated with the development of secondary hair follicles in the cashmere goats were selected through the combination analysis of mRNA and miRNA data. Then the overexpression vector was constructed and the interaction between the miRNA and the target gene was identified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Gene System. The function and interaction relationship of chi-miR-199a-5p and TGF-beta2 were verified by RT-qPCR and western blot at the level of the fibroblasts in Inner Mongolia Cashmere goat. It provides a theoretical basis for further study of miRNA and its target genes regulating the occurrence and development of skin hair follicles. As the result shows, the expression trends of 7 genes (BAMBI, SMAD1, LTBP1, PPP2R1B, ID4, BMP8B and PITX2) and 7 miRNA (chi-miR-17-5p, chi-miR-125b-3p, chi-miR-21-5p, chi-miR-143-5p and chi-miR-106b-5p) in the skin samples for the seven stages of the fetus were shown to be consistent with the sequencing results. the results of sequencing are reliable. The correlation coefficient of TGF-beta2 and chi-miR-199a-5p in fetal 45d-135d expression is-0. 84, showing a strong negative correlation, The target relationship was preliminarily judged. The results of double luciferase vector report showed that chi-miR-199a-5p significantly decreased the expression of luciferase in TGF-beta2 3 ' UTR, It is determined that there is a reciprocal relationship between them at a specific time. We transfected chi-miR199a-5p-FAM mimics into fibroblasts cultured in vitro from Inner Mongolia cashmere goats. After transfection, the cells were harvested to extract total RNA and protein. The mRNA and protein expression levels of TGF-beta2 in fibroblasts were detected by RT-qPCR and western blot. It was verified that chi-miR-199a-5p inhibited TGF-beta2 expression at both mRNA and protein translation levels in fibroblasts. At the same time, it was again proved that the TGF-beta2 gene is a target gene of chi-miR199a-5p.",

ABCA4 gene mutations are the cause of a spectrum of ABCA4 retinopathies, and the most common juvenile macular degeneration is called Stargardt disease. ABCA4 has previously been observed almost exclusively in the retina. Therefore, studying the functional consequences of ABCA4 variants has required advanced molecular analysis techniques. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether human hair follicles may be used for molecular analysis of the ABCA4 gene splice-site variants in patients with ABCA4 retinopathies. We assessed ABCA4 expression in hair follicles and skin at mRNA and protein levels by means of real-time PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. We performed cDNA sequencing to reveal the presence of full-length ABCA4 transcripts and analyzed ABCA4 transcripts from three patients with Stargardt disease carrying different splice-site ABCA4 variants: c. 5312 + 1G > A, c. 5312 + 2T > G and c. 5836-3C > A. cDNA analysis revealed that c. 5312 + 1G > A, c. 5312 + 2T > G variants led to the skipping of exon 37, and the c. 5836-3C > A variant resulted in the insertion of 30 nucleotides into the transcript. Our results strongly argue for the use of hair follicles as a model for the molecular analysis of the pathogenicity of ABCA4 variants in patients with ABCA4 retinopathies.",

Although rubbing was found to increase the skin permeation of drugs, few reports have revealed whether rubbing enhanced either drug permeation through the stratum corneum (SC) or hair follicles (HFs) pathways, or through both. In the present study, we investigated the effects of rubbing on caffeine (CAF) distribution in the SC and HFs. The effect of rubbing direction on the skin penetration of CAF was also investigated. The skin concentration of CAF and its cumulative permeation amount were increased clearly by rubbing. More than six times higher CAF concentrations in the viable epidermis and dermis were observed 5 min after rubbing application compared with no rubbing. On the other hand, slightly increased CAF concentrations were observed in the SC, suggesting that CAF was delivered through the HF pathway by rubbing. Rubbing against the natural hair direction provided the highest skin permeation as well as skin concentrations. Changes in the morphology of the HF opening area might be related to the enhancement effect. These results may provide useful information to understand the effect of rubbing on the skin permeation of applied drugs.",

The primary aim is to compare between the efficacy of single-versus double-spin PRP preparation injection in the treatment of FPHL, while the secondary aim is to assess the relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentrations in different prepared PRP preparations (pre-and post-activation) and the obtained treatment results. 15 female patients with FPHL were subjected to intradermal injection of double-spin prepared PRP into the right (Rt) half of the scalp and single-spin prepared PRP into the left (Lt) half of the scalp, three sessions, 3 weeks apart. Evaluation of treatment response was done through comparing patients ' photographs, patients ' satisfaction and trichoscopic assessment (measurement of terminal hair density) before and after treatment. In addition, VEGF concentration was measured in different PRP samples before and after activation with calcium gluconate. Results showed clinical improvement in both sides of scalp 6 weeks after last PRP session. Meanwhile, Rt median terminal hair density measured by trichoscan following treatment was significantly higher compared to Lt median terminal hair density. Furthermore, VEGF concentration did not differ significantly in single-versus double-spin prepared PRP, or upon calcium activation. PRP is effective in treatment of FPHL. Double-spin method could yield better results than single-spin method. Adding calcium gluconate prior to PRP injection is of no value.",

On each area, 10 microl/cm2 caffeine-hydroxyethyl-cellulose-gel was applied. Samples were collected for 22 h by microdialysis. After sampling, the skin layers were separated, homogenized and caffeine was quantified by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) in all samples. Potential impact of the varnish placed next to the follicle by tension on the follicle during the drying process was monitored by a microscopic setup and could be excluded. The microdialysis and homogenization study showed a significantly reduced penetration of caffeine when the hair follicles were closed. In areas with open hair follicles caffeine was detected already in the first ten minutes after application. The reported novel combination of two methods is suitable to investigate ex vivo transfollicular penetration. Possible impact of the closure material in the control area can be ruled out by adjusting the design of the control area in future studies.",

Although thinning hair and alopecia are not recognized as severe diseases, hair loss has implications for mental health and quality of life ; therefore, a large number of studies have been carried out to develop novel hair growth agents. In the present study, we aimed to examine the potential of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), because TERT overexpression in skin activates resting hair follicle bulge stem cells, which triggers initiation of a new hair follicle growth phase and promotes hair synthesis. To this end, we screened polyphenols that activate TERT expression in keratinocytes, and identified resveratrol and fisetin as strong hTERT-augmenting compounds. These polyphenols also regulated the gene expression of cytokines such as IGF-1 and KGF, which activate the beta-catenin pathway, and TGF-beta1, which plays an important role in maintaining the niche of hair follicle stem cells, thus are thought to play roles in promoting hair growth. We additionally showed that these polyphenols, especially fisetin, promoted hair growth from the shaved dorsal skin of mice, which suggests that these polyphenols activate the transition from telogen to anagen phase. Histological studies indicated that the dorsal skin of mice treated with these polyphenols contained numerous hair follicles and was thickened compared with that in control mice. Furthermore, on the dorsal skin of mice treated with resveratrol and fisetin, a number of proliferating cells (Ki67 + cells) were observed around the hair papilla. These results suggest that resveratrol and fisetin induce a shift from telogen to anagen in the hair follicle by inducing proliferation of hair follicle bulge stem cells, thus promoting hair growth.",

Immunofluorescence study revealed positive type VII collagen expression along the epidermal and follicular basement membrane zone in the donor and recipient sites. A few grafted follicles continued to grow hair on the recipient sites. A total of 360 FUEs were grafted in nine sessions over five years, resulting in healing of most treated ulcers and reduced significantly her time for daily wound dressing. Importantly, FUE grafting using patient ' s own scalp follicles does not require any laboratory manipulation. It is safe and easy to perform.

BACKGROUND: Human dermal papilla (DP) cells and melanocytes (hMel) are central players in hair growth and pigmentation, respectively. In hair follicles (HFs), oxygen (O2) levels average 5%, being coupled with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), necessary to promote hair growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DP cell and hMel proliferation and phenotype were studied under physiological (5% O2, physoxia) or atmospheric (21% O2, normoxia) oxygen levels. hMel-DP cells interactions were studied in indirect co-culture or by directly co-culturing hMel with DP spheroids, to test whether their interaction affected the response to physoxia. RESULTS: Physoxia decreased DP cell senescence and improved their secretome and phenotype, as well as hMel proliferation, migration, and tyrosinase activity. In indirect co-cultures, physoxia affected DP cells ' alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity but their signalling did not influence hMel proliferation or tyrosinase activity. Additionally, ROS production was higher than in monocultures but a direct correlation between ROS generation and ALP activity in DP cells was not observed. In the 3D aggregates, where hMel are organized around the DP, both hMel tyrosinase and DP cells ALP activities, their main functional indicators, plus ROS production were higher in physoxia than normoxia.

    "text": "Diversity of vibrissal follicle anatomy in cetaceans. Most cetaceans are born with vibrissae but they can be lost or reduced in adulthood, especially in odontocetes. Despite this, some species of odontocetes have been found to have functioning vibrissal follicles (including the follicle itself and any remaining vibrissal hair shaft) that play a role in mechanoreception, proprioception and electroreception. This reveals a greater diversity of vibrissal function in odontocetes than in any other mammalian group. However, we know very little about vibrissal follicle form and function across the Cetacea. Here, we qualitatively describe the gross vibrissal follicle anatomy of fetuses of three species of cetaceans, including two odontocetes: Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus), harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), and one mysticete: minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), and compared our findings to previous anatomical descriptions. All three species had few, short vibrissae contained within a relatively simple, single-part follicle, lacking in muscles. However, we observed differences in vibrissal number, follicle size and shape, and innervation distribution between the species. While all three species had nerve fibers around the follicles, the vibrissal follicles of Balaenoptera acutorostrata were innervated by a deep vibrissal nerve, and the nerve fibers of the odontocetes studied were looser and more branched. For example, in Lagenorhynchus acutus, branches of nerve fibers travelled parallel to the follicle, and innervated more superficial areas, rather than just the base. Our anatomical descriptions lend support to the observation that vibrissal morphology is diverse in cetaceans, and is worth further investigation to fully explore links between form and function.",

    "text": "[Updated Molecular Regulation of Hair Growth and Pigmentation by Dermal Papilla Cells]. There is growing evidence that dermal papilla cells (DPCs) act as the organizing center to induce the cyclic hair regeneration. On one hand, DPCs secrete cytokines or growth factors to regulate the differentiation, proliferation, and migration of epithelial stem cells (EpSCs) and melanocyte stem cells (MeSCs) residing in the bulge region. On the other hand, DPCs manipulate the microenvironment (also termed as niche) for both EpSCs and MeSCs, such as the size of dermal papilla, the distance between dermal papilla and the bulge region, and the lymphatic drainage and sympathetic nerve innervation surrounding the bulge region, thereby orchestrating the cycling hair growth. Recent studies have demonstrated at least four subpopulations existing in dermal papillae, which induce the unilineage transit-amplifying epithelial cells to form the concentric multilayers of hair shafts and sheaths. In addition, emerging study has indicated that sustained psychological stress potentially leads to hyperactivation of the sympathetic nerves that innervate the bulge region. The large amount of norepinephrine released by the nerve endings forces MeSCs to rapidly and abnormally proliferate, resultantly causing the depletion of MeSC pool and the loss of hair pigment. Understanding the molecular regulation of hair growth and pigmentation by DPCs holds substantial promise for the future use of cultured DPCs in vitro to treat hair loss.",

    "text": "Nanomaterials in hair care and treatment. Hair care and treatment has evolved significantly through the years as new formulations are continuously being explored in an attempt to meet the demand in cosmetic and medicinal fields. While standard hair care procedures include hair washing, aimed at hair cleansing and maintenance, as well as hair dyeing and bleaching formulations for hair embellishment, modern hair treatments are mainly focused on circumventing hair loss conditions, strengthening hair follicle properties and treat hair infestations. In this regard, active compounds (ACs) included in hair cosmetic formulations include a vast array of hair cleansing and hair dye molecules, and typical hair treatments include anti-hair loss ACs (e. g. minoxidil and finasteride) and anti-lice ACs (e. g. permethrin). However, several challenges still persist, as conventional AC formulations exhibit sub-optimal performance and some may present toxicity issues, calling for an improved design of formulations regarding both efficacy and safety. More recently, nano-based strategies encompassing nanomaterials have emerged as promising tailored approaches to improve the performance of ACs incorporated into hair cosmetics and treatment formulations. The interest in using these nanomaterials is based on account of their ability to: (1) increase stability, safety and biocompatibility of ACs ; (2) maximize hair affinity, contact and retention, acting as versatile biointerfaces ; (3) enable the controlled release of ACs in both hair and scalp, serving as prolonged AC reservoirs ; besides offering (4) hair follicle targeting features attending to the possibility of surface tunability. This review covers the breakthrough of nanomaterials for hair cosmetics and hair treatment, focusing on organic nanomaterials (polymer-based and lipid-based nanoparticles) and inorganic nanomaterials (nanosheets, nanotubes and inorganic nanoparticles), as well as their applications, highlighting their potential as innovative multifunctional nanomaterials towards maximized hair care and treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript is focused on reviewing the nanotechnological strategies investigated for hair care and treatment so far. While conventional formulations exhibit sub-optimal performance and some may present toxicity issues, the selection of improved and suitable nanodelivery systems is of utmost relevance to ensure a proper active ingredient release in both hair and scalp, maximize hair affinity, contact and retention, and provide hair follicle targeting features, warranting stability, efficacy and safety. This innovative manuscript highlights the advantages of nanotechnology-based approaches, particularly as tunable and versatile biointerfaces, and their applications as innovative multifunctional nanomaterials towards maximized hair care and treatment.",

Here, we describe a detailed protocol for generating hair-bearing skin tissue entirely from a homogeneous population of human pluripotent stem cells in a three-dimensional in vitro culture system. Defined culture conditions are used over a 2-week period to induce differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to surface ectoderm and cranial neural crest cells, which give rise to the epidermis and dermis, respectively, in each organoid unit. After 60 d of incubation, the skin organoids produce hair follicles. By day ~ 130, the skin organoids reach full complexity and contain stratified skin layers, pigmented hair follicles, sebaceous glands, Merkel cells and sensory neurons, recapitulating the cell composition and architecture of fetal skin tissue at week 18 of gestation. Skin organoids can be maintained in culture using this protocol for up to 150 d, enabling the organoids to be used to investigate basic skin biology, model disease and, further, reconstruct or regenerate skin tissue.",

Alopecia affected approximately 16. 6% of all people in China, however, treatment options remain limited due to the side effects. Plant bioactive compound baicalin (BC) possesses hair growth-promotion activity, but poor solubility and unsuitable log P value restrict its topical application, and natural Glycyrrhizin (GL) can exactly overcome these drawbacks. Here, BC was encapsulated in GL to form GL-BC micelles for alopecia treatment. Simultaneously, tween 80 (TW) as carriers was incorporated in the GL-BC to form GL-TW-BC micelles. The topical penetration, penetration pathways, cellular uptake and the underlying mechanisms behind the hair loss reconstruction of the GL micelles were investigated. We found that the optimal GL-BC and GL-TW-BC formulations significantly improved the penetration and accumulation of BC in the porcine skin predominantly through the hair follicles pathways without causing skin irritation, which resulted in a targeted treatment. The proliferation of human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and effective cellular uptake was also enhanced. Moreover, the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, up-expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were the mechanisms for the hair recovery. Interestingly, GL and BC exhibited a synergistic treatment of alopecia. Collectively, GL-BC and GL-TW-BC can be used as promising approaches for the treatment of alopecia.",

Syndecan-1 is the prototypic member of a family of heparan sulfate-bearing cell surface proteoglycans that function in adhesion, cell-extracellular matrix interactions, migration, and proliferation. During embryogenesis, syndecan-1 expression in the epithelium is downregulated when the epithelium gives rise to motile mesenchymal cells, whereas mesenchymal syndecan-1 expression is upregulated during organ formation. In aggressive basal cell carcinomas, syndecan-1 expression is evident in the stroma. Some neoplastic cells induce stroma to meet needs for growth, and it may be the mesenchymal cells that produce and shed syndecan-1 into the stroma. The physiologic mechanism by which the hair follicle undergoes its cyclic process of involution and formation of a new active hair follicle is not well understood. Sixty scalp biopsies and a large scalp resection were evaluated for syndecan-1 expression within hair follicles in the growing (anagen), involuting (catagen), and resting (telogen) phases. Strong syndecan-1 immunoreactivity was evident in the outer root sheath (ORS) of the anagen hair follicle, but this expression diminished in intensity with the involution and resting stages in the hair follicle cycle. The diminution of syndecan-1 immunoreactivity in the ORS of involuting and resting hair follicles may be a result of terminal keratinocyte differentiation. Syndecan-1 was also present in the dermal papilla of the anagen hair follicle, where it may promote growth factor-mediated cell signaling that induces and maintains growth of the hair shaft and the inner root sheath.",

    "text": "Molecular control of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during hair follicle cycling. Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions play pivotal roles in the morphogenesis of many organs and various types of appendages. During hair follicle development, extensive interactions between two embryologically different hair follicle compartments (epidermal keratinocytes and dermal papilla fibroblasts) lead to the formation of the hair shaft-producing mini-organ that shows cyclic activity during postnatal life with periods of active growth, involution and resting. During the hair cycle, the epithelium and the mesenchyme are regulated by a distinct set of molecular signals that are unique for every distinct phase of the hair cycle. In telogen hair follicles, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are characterized by a predominance of inhibitory signals that retain the hair follicle in a quiescent state. During anagen, a large variety of growth stimulatory pathways are activated in the epithelium and in the mesenchyme, the coordination of which are essential for proper hair fiber formation. During catagen, the termination of anagen-specific signaling interactions between the epithelium and the mesenchyme leads to apoptosis in the hair follicle epithelium, while activation of selected signaling pathways promotes the transition of the dermal papilla into a quiescent state. The signaling exchange between the follicular epithelium and the mesenchyme is modulated by proteoglycans, such as versican, which may significantly enhance or reduce the biological activities of secreted growth stimulators. However, additional research will be required to bridge the gap between our current understanding of mechanisms underlying epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in hair follicles and the potential clinical application of growth modulators involved in those interactions. Further progress in this area of research will hopefully lead to the development of new drugs for the treatment of hair growth disorders.",

For example, murine hair follicles (HF) show developmentally and spatio-temporally stringently controlled expression of NTs, including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and NT-4, and their cognate receptors, tyrosine kinase A-C (TrkA-C) and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). Follicular NT and NT receptor expression exhibit significant, hair cycle-dependent fluctuations on the gene and protein level, which are mirrored by changes in nerve fiber density and neurotransmitter/neuropeptide content in the perifollicular neural networks. NT-3/TrkC and NGF/TrkA signaling stimulate HF development, while NT-3, NT-4 and BDNF inhibit the growth (anagen) of mature HF by the induction of apoptosis-driven HF regression (catagen). p75NTR stimulation inhibits HF development and stimulates catagen. Since the HF is thus both a prominent target and key peripheral source of NT, dissecting the role of NTs in the control of HF morphogenesis and cyclic remodeling provides a uniquely accessible, and easily manipulated, clinically relevant experimental model, which has many lessons to teach. Given that our most recent data also implicate NTs in human hair growth control, selective NT receptor agonists and antagonists may become innovative therapeutic tools for the management of hair growth disorders (alopecia, effluvium, hirsutism). Since, however, the same NT receptor agonists that inhibit hair growth (e. g., BDNF, NT-4) can actually stimulate epidermal keratinocyte proliferation, NT may exert differential effects on defined keratinocyte subpopulations. The studies reviewed here provide new clues to understanding the complex roles of NT in epithelial tissue biology and remodeling in vivo, and invite new applications for synthetic NT receptor ligands for the treatment of epithelial growth disorders, exploiting the HF as a lead model.",

Differential integrin expression has been used to detect cells of increased proliferative potential but further stem cell markers are urgently required for in vivo and in vitro characterization. Using LHM2, a monoclonal antibody reacting with a high molecular weight melanoma-associated proteoglycan core protein, a subset of basal keratinocytes in both the interfollicular epidermis and the hair follicle has been identified. Coexpression of melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with keratins 15 and 19 as well as beta 1 and alpha 6 integrins has been examined in adult and fetal human skin from hair bearing, nonhair bearing, and palmoplantar regions. Although melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan coexpression with a subset of beta 1 integrin bright basal keratinocytes within the epidermis suggests that melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan colocalizes with epidermal stem cells, melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expression within the hair follicle was more complex and multiple subpopulations of basal outer root sheath keratinocytes are described.

Our objectives were to evaluate the effect of CsA on follicular hair keratinocyte growth in nude mice by assessing their proliferation in vivo, and to assess the ability of CsA to prevent follicular keratinocyte apoptosis in vivo and chemotherapy-induced keratinocyte apoptosis in vitro. METHODS: Nude mice were fed various daily doses of CsA (10-100 mg/kg). Dorsal skin sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, followed by immunostaining with 4-deoxybromouridine, were examined for determination of hair follicle number and hair follicle keratinocyte proliferation. Follicular keratinocytes were isolated and examined for apoptotic status. Apoptosis was induced in vitro in a keratinocyte cell line by 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide. The antiapoptotic effects of various CsA concentrations (0. 1-5 microg/ml) were measured by annexin-V/propidium iodide binding. RESULTS: CsA caused a dose-dependent increase in the number of hair follicles but had no effect on follicular keratinocyte proliferation. Treatment with CsA decreased the number of apoptotic follicular keratinocytes. In vitro, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of the extent of early and late apoptosis of treated keratinocytes. CONCLUSION: CsA may induce hair growth by increasing the number of hair follicles and inhibiting apoptosis of follicular keratinocytes, thereby delaying hair follicle regression.",

This alopecia results from an inability to initiate the anagen phase of the hair cycle after follicle morphogenesis is complete. Thus, once the initial hair is shed it does not regrow. VDR expression in the epidermal component of the hair follicle, the keratinocyte, is critical for maintenance of the hair cycle. To determine which functional domains of the VDR are required for hair cycling, mutant VDR transgenes were targeted to the keratinocytes of VDR null mice. Keratinocyte-specific expression of a VDR transgene with a mutation in the hormone-binding domain that abolishes ligand binding restores normal hair cycling in VDR null mice, whereas a VDR transgene with a mutation in the activation function 2 domain that impairs nuclear receptor coactivator recruitment results in a partial rescue. Mutations in the nuclear receptor corepressor Hairless are also associated with alopecia in humans and mice. Hairless binds the VDR, resulting in transcriptional repression. Neither VDR mutation affects Hairless interactions or its ability to repress transcription. These studies demonstrate that the effects of the VDR on the hair follicle are ligand independent and point to novel molecular and cellular actions of this nuclear receptor.",

The mutant phenotype was characterized by sparse and wavy hair, which was most prominent at age 3-4 weeks, and was inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The swh/swh rats showed impaired gain of body weight, and their hair follicles were reduced both in number and size, associated with hypoplasia of the sebaceous glands and the subcutaneous fat tissue.

Heterozygous Inv-Cldn6 mice exhibit a distinct coat phenotype and histological analysis shows mild epidermal hyperkeratosis. Expression of K5 and K14 is aberrant, extending beyond the basal layer into the suprabasal layer where they are not co-localized suggesting that their expression is uncoupled. There is also atypical K17 and patchy K15 expression in the basal layer with no K6 expression in the interfollicular epidermis ; together with marked changes in late differentiation markers (e. g. profilaggrin/filaggrin, loricrin, transglutaminase 3) indicating that the normal epidermal differentiation program is modified. The expression compartment of various Cldns is also perturbed although overall protein levels remained comparable. Most notably induction of Cldn5 and Cldn8 was observed in the Inv-Cldn6 epidermis. Heterozygous Inv-Cldn6 animals also exhibit subtle alterations in the differentiation program of the hair follicle including a shorter anagen phase, and altered hair type distribution and length compared to the wild type ; the approximately 20% increase in zig-zag hair fibers at the expense of guard hairs and the approximately 30% shorter guard hairs contribute to coat abnormalities in the heterozygous mice. In addition, the transgenic hair follicles exhibit a decreased expression of K15 as well as some hair-specific keratins and express Cldn5 and Cldn18, which are not detectable in the wild type.

BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous gaseous lipophilic molecule generated from the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by the NO synthases (NOSs). Ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced NO production appears to stimulate epidermal melanogenesis. However, given their relative protection from UVR, it is unclear whether NO plays a similar role in hair bulb melanocytes. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the expression profiles of the NOS isoforms endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) and of phosphorylated eNOS and nitrotyrosine within the epidermal and follicular melanin units of normal human haired scalp during the hair growth cycle. METHODS: This study employed single and double immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining techniques using haired scalp from 10 healthy individuals (six women and four men). RESULTS: Melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis expressed eNOS, nNOS and nitrotyrosine. By contrast, melanogenically active melanocytes of the anagen hair bulb were wholly negative for these markers. However, other follicular melanocytes not actively involved in pigment production, including undifferentiated melanocytes located in the outer root sheath and melanocytes surviving the apoptosis-driven hair follicle (HF) regression during catagen/telogen, expressed eNOS, nNOS and nitrotyrosine. While iNOS was only weakly expressed in the basal layer of the human epidermis, it was highly expressed in keratinocytes of the inner root sheath (IRS), where it colocalized with trichohyalin, a differentiation-associated protein of the IRS that requires enzyme-catalysed conversion of arginine to citrulline. CONCLUSIONS: The NOS isoforms and nitrotyrosine are differentially expressed in different cutaneous melanocyte subpopulations. Results of this study suggest a possible role for eNOS, nNOS, iNOS and nitrotyrosine in melanocyte biology, particularly with respect to melanogenesis and melanocyte survival during HF regression. Another example of possible NO involvement in HF biology is the postsynthetic modification of trichohyalin in differentiating keratinocytes of the IRS. These results suggest that NO may influence several aspects of HF biology.",

TERT, the protein component of telomerase, serves to maintain telomere function through the de novo addition of telomere repeats to chromosome ends, and is reactivated in 90% of human cancers. In normal tissues, TERT is expressed in stem cells and in progenitor cells, but its role in these compartments is not fully understood. Here we show that conditional transgenic induction of TERT in mouse skin epithelium causes a rapid transition from telogen (the resting phase of the hair follicle cycle) to anagen (the active phase), thereby facilitating robust hair growth. TERT overexpression promotes this developmental transition by causing proliferation of quiescent, multipotent stem cells in the hair follicle bulge region. This new function for TERT does not require the telomerase RNA component, which encodes the template for telomere addition, and therefore operates through a mechanism independent of its activity in synthesizing telomere repeats. These data indicate that, in addition to its established role in extending telomeres, TERT can promote proliferation of resting stem cells through a non-canonical pathway.",

Hair follicles are an immune protected site with deficient MHC expression. Evidence is presented suggesting that alopecia areata results from loss of immune privilege with presentation of autoantigens. Alopecia areata is one of the most common human autoimmune conditions, with a lifetime risk of approximately 1. 7%. Study of alopecia areata in humans is facilitated by the accessibility of scalp for biopsy. It is possible to transfer the condition with lesional human lymphocytes in a human scalp graft/SCID mouse model.

    "text": "Role of androgen in mesenchymal epithelial interactions in human hair follicle. Human hair follicles, which are distributed in various and specific sites of the body, appear to have an inherited susceptibility for androgen-dependent growth. Beard, axillary, and frontal scalp dermal papilla cells (DPC) were recently shown to possess the characteristics of androgen target cells. These DPC show strong expression of androgen receptors, and the expression of type II 5alpha reductase is restricted to beard and frontal scalp DPC. These findings suggest that DPC mediate the signals of androgen to follicular epithelial cells in a paracrine fashion. We developed an in vitro co-culture system using DPC and keratinocytes (KC) to characterize the mode of androgen action in human hair follicles. Androgen significantly stimulated the proliferation of KC co-cultured with beard DPC, indicating that beard DPC produce androgen-dependent diffusible growth factors. Insulin-like growth factor-I was identified as one of the androgen-dependent paracrine growth factors produced by beard DPC. We also identified the inhibitory role of androgen on the growth of KC co-cultured with DPC from androgenetic alopecia (AGA) when the DPC were transfected with an expression vector encoding the androgen receptor. This growth suppression of KC was mediated by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) derived from DPC of AGA, suggesting that TGF-beta1 is a paracrine mediator for AGA.",

Epidermis is a continually renewing, stratified squamous epithelium. It is populated by keratinocytes (80%) and dendritic cells (20%): melanocytes, Langerhans and Merkel cells. In standard histology, keratinocytes are arranged in layers that represent different stages of their differentiation while melanocytes and Langerhans cells appear as clear cells respectively between the basal and the supra-basal cells of epidermis. The Merkel cells cannot be clearly identified. Dendritic processes of the dendritic cells can only be recognized by immunocytochemistry. At the dermal-epidermal junction, a PAS reactive basement membrane follows the contour of the basal cells. Dermis consists of collagenous and elastic fibers embedded into an amorphous ground substance. Fibroblasts, macrophages, mast cells and lymphocytes are its resident cells. Hypodermis is composed of adipocyte lobules defined by fibrous connective tissue septa. Hair follicle consists of 3 parts: the lower portion, from the base of the follicle including hair bulb to the insertion of the arrector pili muscle or buldge ; the isthmus, from the insertion of the arrector pili to the entrance of the sebaceous duct, and the infundibulum, from the entrance of the sebaceous duct to the follicular orifice. The lower portion is composed of the dermal hair papilla, the hair matrix, the hair, and the inner and the outer root sheaths. The hair matrix cells within hair bulb give rise to the hair and to the inner root sheath. With the electron microscope, one can obtain a more detailed view of the characteristic skin structures. Much of them can now be explained in terms of function and in many instances, in correlation with its biochemical composition. An attempt has been made in this paper to precisely give the location of molecules that are relevant in basic skin functions and understanding of auto-immune and genetic diseases.",

Several aspects of the intermediate filaments ' molecular architecture remain mysterious despite decades of study. The growth process and the final architecture may depend on the physical, chemical, and biochemical environment. Aiming at clarifying this issue, we have revisited the structure of the human hair follicle by means of X-ray microdiffraction. We conclude that the histology-based growth zones along the follicle are correlated to the fine architecture of the filaments deduced from X-ray microdiffraction. Our analysis reveals the existence of two major polymorph intermediate filament architectures. Just above the bulb, the filaments are characterized by a diameter of 100 Angstroms and a low-density core. The following zone upwards is characterized by the lateral aggregation of the filaments into a compact network of filaments, by a contraction of their diameter (to 75 Angstroms) and by the setting up of a long-range longitudinal ordering. In the upper zone, the small structural change associated with the tissue hardening likely concerns the terminal domains. The architecture of the intermediate filament in the upper zones could be specific to hard alpha-keratin whilst the other architecture found in the lower zone could be representative for intermediate filaments in a different environment.",

The flat and round dermal papilla lay at the bottom of the hair bulb in the telogen and anagen stages. In the hair follicle with accelerated growth, the dermal papilla became elongated, loosened, and closely adhered to the hair matrix. In the catagen stage the dermal papilla shrunk, and became separated from the hair matrix. A new hair bulb was regenerated when the hair follicle was transected at a low level.

Stanozolol (17beta-hydroxy-17alpha-methyl-5alpha-androst-2-eno [3, 2c] pyrazol) is a testosterone analogue with the same anabolic effect like testosterone but its ring structure makes it possible to take it orally. Therefore, stanozolol is one of the most frequently used anabolic steroids. Common verification methods for anabolic drugs exist, identifying the chemicals in tissues, like hair or blood samples. The idea of this feasibility study was to search for specific gene expression regulations induced by stanozolol to identify the possible influence of the synthetically hormone on different metabolic pathways. Finding biomarkers for anabolic drugs could be supportive of the existing methods and an additional proof for illegal drug abuse. In two separate cell cultures, human HFDPC (hair follicle dermal papilla cells) from a female and a male donor were treated with stanozolol. In the female cell culture treatment concentrations of 0 nM (control), 1 nM, 10 nM and 100 nM were chosen. Cells were taken 0 h, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h after stimulation and totalRNA was extracted. Learning from the results of the pilot experiment, the male cell culture was treated in 10 nM and 100 nM concentrations and taken after 0 h, 6 h, 24 h and 72 h. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR expression of characteristics of different target genes were analysed. Totally 13 genes were selected according to their functionality by screening the actual literature and composed to functional groups: factors of apoptosis regulation were Fas Ligand (FasL), its receptor (FasR), Caspase 8 and Bcl-2. Androgen receptor (AR) and both estrogen receptors (ERalpha, ERbeta) were summarized in the steroid receptor group. The growth factor group included the insulin like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) and growth hormone receptor (GHR). Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and keratinocyte growth factor (FGF7) were summarized in the hair cycle factor group. 5alpha-Steroidreductases (SRD5A1, SRD5A2) represented the enzyme group. Three reference genes were taken for relative quantification: ubiquitin (UBQ), glycerinaldehyde-3-phsophate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and beta-actin (ACTB). In cell culture 1 AR, FasR, FGF2 showed significant regulations within one treatment time, significant gene expressions over time were analysed for Caspase 8. In cell culture 2 AR, FasR and SRD5A2 were significantly regulated within one treatment time.

Western blotting with a GSK-3beta-specific antibody, Y174, also demonstrated GSK-3beta expression in the follicles. Moreover, GSK-3beta immunostaining with Y174 showed that GSK-3beta colocalized with hair follicle bulge markers. Contrary to GSK-3beta, GSK-3 alpha was widely expressed throughout the follicles when immunostained with a specific antibody, EP793Y. We then investigated the influence of GSK-3 inhibition. A GSK-3 inhibitor, BIO, promoted the growth of human outer root sheath cells, which could be cultured for up to four passages. The BIO-treated cells exhibited smaller and more undifferentiated morphology than control cells. Moreover, in organ culture of plucked human hair, outer root sheath cells in the middle of a hair follicle proliferated when cultured with BIO.

Chronic wounds and acute trauma constitute well-established risk factors for development of epithelial-derived skin tumors, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the most common skin cancers displaying a number of features reminiscent of hair follicle (HF)-derived cells and are dependent on deregulated Hedgehog (Hh)/GLI signaling. Here we show, in a mouse model conditionally expressing GLI1 and in a model with homozygous inactivation of Ptch1, mimicking the situation in human BCCs, that the wound environment accelerates the initiation frequency and growth of BCC-like lesions. Lineage tracing reveals that both oncogene activation and wounding induce emigration of keratinocytes residing in the lower bulge and the nonpermanent part of the HFs toward the interfollicular epidermis (IFE). However, only oncogene activation in combination with a wound environment enables the participation of such cells in the initiation of BCC-like lesions at the HF openings and in the IFE. We conclude that, in addition to the direct enhancement of BCC growth, the tumor-promoting effect of the wound environment is due to recruitment of tumor-initiating cells originating from the neighboring HFs, establishing a link between epidermal wounds and skin cancer risk.",

BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) is a common hair loss disorder characterized by cellular autoimmune reaction predominantly involving the bulbar portion of anagen hair follicles. In most cases of AA, the bulge stem cell area remains intact. Recently, a couple of molecules, such as keratin15 (K15) and CD200, have been identified as biomarkers of human bulge cells. Of note, an immunosuppressive molecule, CD200 is speculated to provide an immune privilege for bulge stem cells. OBJECTIVE: To investigate expression levels of stem cell markers, especially CD200, in two senile female cases of AA with unusual lymphocytic cell infiltrates surrounding both the bulge and the bulbar regions. Then, compare them with those in common AA cases without the bulge involvement. METHODS: Transverse sections containing the bulge levels were prepared from unaffected and affected lesions, respectively, from each AA group and immunohistochemical investigation using anti-K15 and CD200 antibodies was performed. Importantly, an approach to detect CD200 in paraffin sections was newly developed. Immunoreactivities of individual antibodies were compared between corresponding lesions in each patient group. RESULTS: In unaffected bulge lesions, K15 immunoreactivity was not different between bulge-involving AA and common AA groups, whilst that of CD200 was decreased in the former group. Both K15 and CD200 immunoreactivities were decreased in affected bulge lesions of bulge-involving AA compared to the bulge of common AA cases.

Natural mutations in the LIPH gene were shown to be responsible for hair growth defects in humans and for the rex short hair phenotype in rabbits. In this species, we identified a single nucleotide deletion in LIPH (1362delA) introducing a stop codon in the C-terminal region of the protein. We investigated the expression of LIPH between normal coat and rex rabbits during critical fetal stages of hair follicle genesis, in adults and during hair follicle cycles. Transcripts were three times less expressed in both fetal and adult stages of the rex rabbits than in normal rabbits. In addition, the hair growth cycle phases affected the regulation of the transcription level in the normal and mutant phenotypes differently. LIPH mRNA and protein levels were higher in the outer root sheath (ORS) than in the inner root sheath (IRS), with a very weak signal in the IRS of rex rabbits. In vitro transfection shows that the mutant protein has a reduced lipase activity compared to the wild type form. Our results contribute to the characterization of the LIPH mode of action and confirm the crucial role of LIPH in hair production.",

Ectodysplasin (Eda), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) family, regulates skin appendage morphogenesis via its receptor Edar and transcription factor NF-kappaB. In humans, inactivating mutations in the Eda pathway components lead to hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), a syndrome characterized by sparse hair, tooth abnormalities, and defects in several cutaneous glands. A corresponding phenotype is observed in Eda-null mice, where failure in the initiation of the first wave of hair follicle development is a hallmark of HED pathogenesis. In an attempt to discover immediate target genes of the Eda/NF-kappaB pathway, we performed microarray profiling of genes differentially expressed in embryonic skin explants after a short exposure to recombinant Fc-Eda protein. Upregulated genes included components of the Wnt, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, Tnf, and epidermal growth factor families, indicating that Eda modulates multiple signaling pathways implicated in skin appendage development. Surprisingly, we identified two ligands of the chemokine receptor cxcR3, cxcl10 and cxcl11, as new hair-specific transcriptional targets of Eda. Deficiency in cxcR3 resulted in decreased primary hair follicle density but otherwise normal hair development, indicating that chemokine signaling influences the patterning of primary hair placodes only.",

Primary cicatricial alopecia (PCA) is a group of inflammatory hair disorders that cause scarring and permanent hair loss. Previous studies have implicated PPARgamma, a transcription factor that integrates lipogenic and inflammatory signals, in the pathogenesis of PCA. However, it is unknown what triggers the inflammatory response in these disorders, whether the inflammation is a primary or secondary event in disease pathogenesis, and whether the inflammatory reaction reflects an autoimmune process. In this paper, we show that the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is impaired in the skin and hair follicles of PCA patients. Treatment of hair follicle cells with BM15766, a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, or 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), a sterol precursor, stimulates the expression of pro-inflammatory chemokine genes. Painting of mouse skin with 7-DHC or BM15766 inhibits hair growth, causes follicular plugging and induces the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the interfollicular dermis. Our results demonstrate that cholesterologenic changes within hair follicle cells trigger an innate immune response that is associated with the induction of toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) gene expression, and the recruitment of macrophages that surround the hair follicles and initiate their destruction. These findings reveal a previously unsuspected role for cholesterol precursors in PCA pathogenesis and identify a novel link between sterols and inflammation that may prove transformative in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",

Distinct hair-follicle regions had differences in their expression of ligands for CCR2 and CCR6. The isthmus expressed the chemokine CCL2 ; the infundibulum expressed the chemokine CCL20 ; and keratinocytes in the bulge produced the chemokine CCL8, which is the ligand for CCR8.

The hair follicle is a widely available and instructive miniature organ in the human body that experiences major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I dependent immune privilege (IP). There are various regulation factors that act on the generation, maintenance, and collapse of hair follicle IP. Neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are created in many organs, including skin, and display various immune regulation effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the phenotypic effect of CGRP on the hair follicle ' s IP. First, we used interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) to generate ectopic MHC antigen expression model in cultured human hair follicles as previously described. Then, we examined the effects of CGRP on the regulation of ectopic MHC antigen expression in cultured human hair follicles using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical staining techniques. IFN-gamma (75 IU/ml) induced ectopic MHC expression. CGRP down-regulated INF-gamma-induced ectopic MHC class I mRNA expression. These down-regulated effects were especially evident in 10 (-8) M. In addition, CGRP also suppressed the staining intensity related to the expression of MHC class I and MHC class I-pathway related molecules (beta2-microglobulin), but had no effect on MHC class II antigen expression. Taken together, these results indicate that CGRP might be an important regulatory factor for IP maintenance and restoration of IP via suppression of MHC class I antigen.",

Epidermal stem cells residing in different locations in the skin continuously self-renew and differentiate into distinct cell lineages to maintain skin homeostasis during postnatal life. Murine epidermal stem cells located at the bulge region are responsible for replenishing the hair lineage, while the stem cells at the isthmus regenerate interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous glands. In vitro cell culture and in vivo animal studies have implicated TGF-beta signaling in the maintenance of epidermal and hair cycle homeostasis. Here, we employed a triple transgenic animal model that utilizes a combined Cre/loxP and rtTA/TRE system to allow inducible and reversible inhibition of TGF-beta signaling in hair follicle lineages and suprabasal layer of the epidermis. Using this animal model, we have analyzed the role of TGF-beta signaling in distinct phases of the hair cycle. Transient abrogation of TGF-beta signaling does not prevent catagen progression ; however, it induces aberrant proliferation and differentiation of isthmus stem cells to epidermis and sebocyte lineages and a blockade in anagen re-entry as well as results in an incomplete hair shaft development. Moreover, ablation of TGF-beta signaling during anagen leads to increased apoptosis in the secondary hair germ and bulb matrix cells. Blocking of TGF-beta signaling in bulge stem cell cultures abolishes their colony-forming ability, suggesting that TGF-beta signaling is required for the maintenance of bulge stem cells. At the molecular level, inhibition of TGF-beta signaling results in a decrease in both Lrig1-expressing isthmus stem cells and Lrg5-expressing bulge stem cells, which may account for the phenotypes seen in our animal model. These data strongly suggest that TGF-beta signaling plays an important role in regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of distinct epithelial stem cell populations in hair follicles.",

BACKGROUND: Thuja orientalis has been traditionally used to treat patients who suffer from baldness and hair loss in East Asia. The present study sought to investigate the hair growth-promoting activity of T. orientalis hot water extract and the underlying mechanism of action. METHODS: After T. orientalis extract was topically applied to the shaved dorsal skin of telogenic C57BL/6 N mice, the histomorphometric analysis was employed to study induction of the hair follicle cycle. To determine the effect of T. orientalis extract on the telogen to anagen transition, the protein expression levels of beta-catenin and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in hair follicles were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We observed that T. orientalis extract promoted hair growth by inducing the anagen phase in telogenic C57BL/6 N mice. Specifically, the histomorphometric analysis data indicates that topical application of T. orientalis extract induced an earlier anagen phase and prolonged the mature anagen phase, in contrast to either the control or 1% minoxidil-treated group. We also observed increases in both the number and size of hair follicles of the T. orientalis extract-treated group. Moreover, the immunohistochemical analysis reveals earlier induction of beta-catenin and Shh proteins in hair follicles of the T. orientalis extract-treated group, compared to the control or 1% minoxidil-treated group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that T. orientalis extract promotes hair growth by inducing the anagen phase in resting hair follicles and might therefore be a potential hair growth-promoting agent.",

Drug delivery to hair follicles was clearly shown to be dependent on the physicochemical properties of the applied substances and vehicles as well as on the activity status, size and density of the hair follicles. Especially particulate substances were demonstrated to be proficient drug carriers into the hair follicles, whereas dependent data for transfollicular penetration into the deeper viable skin layers could only be found for non-particulate substances which then, however, received rapid access to the circulation when the follicular pathway was accessible.

BACKGROUND: Hairless (HR), a transcriptional cofactor, plays important roles in hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and cycling. Recently, we reported the new Hr mutant mouse called \" \" Hairpoor \" \" (Hr (Hp)) that causes HR overexpression through translational de-repression. The Msh homeobox 2 (Msx2) is a homolog of the Drosophila muscle segment homeobox (msh) gene, which expressed in the hair bulb, including in the germinal matrix, and its expression spreads into the upper region of the HF including the hair cortex. OBJECTIVE: Although Msx2 is regarded as an important gene in hair cycle control and hair shaft differentiation, the regulation of Msx2 expression is not well-known. METHODS: Using realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot, we investigated the relationship between HR and Msx2 in the Hr (Hp)/Hr (Hp) mouse during the HF morphogenesis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare the pattern of expression of MSX2 in Hr (Hp)/Hr (Hp) mouse skin with that in wild-type skin. Msx2 mRNA expression and promoter activity was estimated using a transient expression system to see whether HR down-regulates Msx2 expression in vitro. We also investigated whether downregulation of MSX2 by HR also affects the MSX2 regulatory pathway in the Hr (Hp)/Hr (Hp) mouse and in an in vitro system. RESULTS: We found that the expression of Msx2 was down-regulated by HR, which in turn down-regulated expression of Foxn1 and Lef1, MSX2 target genes, in vivo as well as in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our results show that HR regulates expression of genes in the MSX2 regulatory pathway, which explains abnormal HF formation in Hr (Hp)/Hr (Hp) skin. \"",

We ascertained two families from Pakistan who presented with familial trichomegaly, or extreme eyelash growth. Using a combination of whole exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping, we identified distinct pathogenic mutations within fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) that underlie the disorder. Subsequent sequencing of this gene in several additional trichomegaly families identified an additional mutation in FGF5. We further demonstrated that hair fibers from forearms of these patients were significantly longer than hairs from control individuals, with an increased proportion in the growth phase, anagen. Using hair follicle organ cultures, we show that FGF5 induces regression of the human hair follicle. We have identified FGF5 as a crucial regulator of hair growth in humans for the first time, to our knowledge, and uncovered a therapeutic target to selectively regulate eyelash growth.",

Recently, various immunosuppressant drugs have been shown to induce hair growth in normal hair as well as in alopecia areata and androgenic alopecia ; however, the responsible mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigate the influence of mycophenolate (MPA), an immunosuppressant, on the proliferation of human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and on the growth of human hair follicles following catagen induction with interferon (IFN)-gamma. IFN-gamma was found to reduce beta-catenin, an activator of hair follicle growth, and activate glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta, and enhance expression of the Wnt inhibitor DKK-1 and catagen inducer transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2. IFN-gamma inhibited expression of ALP and other dermal papillar cells (DPCs) markers such as Axin2, IGF-1, and FGF 7 and 10. MPA increased beta-catenin in IFN-gamma-treated hDPCs leading to its nuclear accumulation via inhibition of GSK3beta and reduction of DKK-1. Furthermore, MPA significantly increased expression of ALP and other DPC marker genes but inhibited expression of TGF-beta2. Therefore, we demonstrate for the first time that IFN-gamma induces catagen-like changes in hDPCs and in hair follicles via inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and that MPA stabilizes beta-catenin by inhibiting GSK3beta leading to increased beta-catenin target gene and DP signature gene expression, which may, in part, counteract IFN-gamma-induced catagen in hDPCs.",

Keratinocyte stem/progenitor cells (KSCs) reside in the bulge region of the hair follicles and may be involved in hair growth. Hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) and outer root sheath (ORS) cells were treated with conditioned medium (CM) of KSCs. Moreover, the effects of KSC-CM on hair growth were examined ex vivo and in vivo. A human growth factor chip array and RT-PCR were employed to identify enriched proteins in KSC-CM as compared with CM from keratinocytes. KSC-CM significantly increased the proliferation of HFDPCs and ORS cells, and increased the S-phase of the cell cycle in HFDPCs. KSC-CM led to the phosphorylation of ATK and ERK1/2 in both cell types. After subcutaneous injection of KSC-CM in C3H/HeN mice, a significant increase in hair growth and increased proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes ex vivo was observed. We identified six proteins enriched in KSC-CM (amphiregulin, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-5, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, Platelet-derived growth factor-AA, and vascular endothelial growth factor). A growth-factor cocktail that contains these six recombinant growth factors significantly increased the proliferation of HFDPCs and ORS cells and enhanced the hair growth of mouse models.

    "text": "Changes in the sebaceous gland in patients with male pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia). BACKGROUND: The sebaceous gland and the follicular bulge region have important role in biology of the hair. They initiate destruction of the hair follicle both in human and animal models in certain conditions. The morphometric feature of the sebaceous gland is not well understood so as the distribution of the bulge stem cells in pathological conditions of male pattern hair loss or androgenic alopecia (AGA). OBJECTIVES: The authors perform morphometric analysis of the sebaceous gland in AGA patients and also study distribution of the follicular stem cells in the bulge region in these populations. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty cases of glass slide specimen from Japanese patients with male pattern hair loss were reviewed. Among these, 23 cases of the longitudinal (vertical) sections of the scalp skin with diagnosis of AGA were found and analyzed for the morphometric characteristics. Each sebaceous gland area was measured using NIH imagej system and statistically analyzed. For the identification of the follicular bulge region, an immunohistochemistry using anticytokeratin 15 (C8/144B clone) was carried out in the cases of AGA. RESULTS: The sebaceous gland area of the AGA group was noticeably increased, while the size of each sebaceous gland remains unchanged. It has more lobules in the hair follicular unit in the AGA population. In the immunohistochemistry, the follicular stem cells are present in the bulge regions in cases of AGA. CONCLUSIONS: The overgrowth (multilobulation) of the sebaceous gland and relative preservation of the follicular stem cells suggest that the changes in the sebaceous gland could be an important factor in the pathology of AGA.",

Dun is a wild-type coat color in horses characterized by pigment dilution with a striking pattern of dark areas termed primitive markings. Here we show that pigment dilution in Dun horses is due to radially asymmetric deposition of pigment in the growing hair caused by localized expression of the T-box 3 (TBX3) transcription factor in hair follicles, which in turn determines the distribution of hair follicle melanocytes. Most domestic horses are non-dun, a more intensely pigmented phenotype caused by regulatory mutations impairing TBX3 expression in the hair follicle, resulting in a more circumferential distribution of melanocytes and pigment granules in individual hairs. We identified two different alleles (non-dun1 and non-dun2) causing non-dun color. non-dun2 is a recently derived allele, whereas the Dun and non-dun1 alleles are found in ancient horse DNA, demonstrating that this polymorphism predates horse domestication. These findings uncover a new developmental role for T-box genes and new aspects of hair follicle biology and pigmentation.",

Dermal papilla (DP) cells are required for SC activation during the adult hair cycle, but signal exchange between niche and SC precursors/transit-amplifying cell (TAC) progenitors that regulates HF morphogenetic growth is largely unknown.

The effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the development and growth of hair follicle is controversial. In the present study, 2-20 ng/ml EGF promoted the growth of mink hair follicles in vitro, whereas 200 ng/ml EGF inhibited follicle growth. Further, dermal papilla (DP) cells, a group of mesenchymal cells that govern hair follicle development and growth, were isolated and cultured in vitro. Treatment with or forced expression of EGF accelerated proliferation and induced G1/S transition in DP cells. Moreover, EGF upregulated the expression of DP mesenchymal genes, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), as well as the Notch pathway molecules including Notch1, Jagged1, Hes1 and Hes5. In addition, inhibition of Notch signaling pathway by DAPT significantly reduced the basal and EGF-enhanced proliferation rate, and also suppressed cell cycle progression. We also show that the expression of several follicle-regulatory genes, such as Survivin and Msx2, were upregulated by EGF, and was inhibited by DAPT. In summary, our study demonstrates that the concentration of EGF is critical for the switch between hair follicle growth and inhibition, and EGF promotes DP cell proliferation via Notch signaling pathway.",

Recent studies have shown that prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and its nonenzymatic metabolite, 15-deoxy-Delta (12, 14)-prostaglandin J2 (15-dPGJ2), inhibit in vitro growth of explanted human hair follicles and inhibit hair growth in mice through the GPR44 (DP2). However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we first investigated the expression of DP2 in human hair follicles and in cultured follicular cells. We found that DP2 is strongly expressed in the outer root sheath (ORS) cells and weakly expressed in the dermal papilla (DP) cells. We observed slight growth stimulation when ORS and DP cells were treated with PGD2. We also observed slight growth stimulation when DP and ORS cells were treated with low concentrations (0. 5 and 1 muM) of 15-dPGJ2. However, 5 muM 15-dPGJ2 inhibited the viability and caused apoptosis of both cell types. Exposure of cultured human hair follicles to 15-dPGJ2 resulted in significant apoptosis in follicular keratinocytes. Altogether, our data provide an evidence that 15-dPGJ2 promotes apoptosis in follicular keratinocytes and provide rationale for developing remedies for the prevention and treatment of hair loss based on DP2 antagonism.",

Three-dimensional constructs formed by cells embedded in an exogenous scaffold could not represent a faithful in vitro replica of native and functional tissues. In this work we produced an endogenous human skin equivalent by means of a tissue engineering process that induces the full morphogenesis of functional dermal and epidermal compartments. In such an organotypic context we demonstrated that-by using adult human skin cells-it is possible to generate follicle-like structures in vitro resembling what occurs in vivo in the fetal skin. Immunotypization evidences an inward-oriented differentiation of the follicular-like structures through immunopositivity for epithelial stem cell markers such as p63 and K19. Moreover we detected the presence of versican within the intricate network of the dermal compartment, suggesting its role as an inductive factor for the morphogenesis of appendage-like structures. These results support the importance of the repository and regulatory role of the endogenous extra cellular matrix in guiding tissue morphogenesis. The microenvironment provided by the endogenous human skin equivalent preserves p63 and K19 positive cells and could finally be involved in: (i) triggering the arrangement of the keratinocytes in follicle-like structures ; (ii) promoting the convolute profile of the derma-epidermal junction and (iii) improving epidermis barrier function.

The optimal treatment effect was observed at 10% WW and 1% WWP, which were better than 2% finasteride treatment. MTS assay results suggested that WW and WWP remarkably increased the proliferation of HFDPCs. Inhibitor assay of 5alpha-reductase showed that WW and WWP inhibited significantly the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotesterone, and the IC50 values of WW and WWP were higher than that of finasteride. In Conclusion, WW and WWP could act against testosterone-induced alopecia in mice, and they promoted hair growth by inhibiting 5alpha-reductase activity and HFDPCs proliferation. DPCs is the target cell of WW and WWP.",

The human hair shaft is covered with multiple scale-like cuticular layers. During the terminal differentiation stage of immature cuticular cells within the hair follicle, cysteine-rich calcium binding S100A3 protein is predominantly translated, and its arginine residues are converted to citrullines by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADI). In this study, we found several naturally occurring compounds (e. g., hinokitiol, escletin, and quercetin) elevate S100A3 citrullination in a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (SW480). Selected compounds similarly promoted cuticular differentiation within isolated human hair follicles. Their promotive activities correlated with the previously reported inhibitory activities of arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) in vitro. Microarray analysis revealed that ALOX12 inhibitor remarkably up-regulated heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HBEGF). ALOX12 inhibitor and recombinant HBEGF similarly regulated expression of PADI genes in SW480 cells. In isolated hair follicles, arachidonic acid strongly promoted S100A3 citrullination along with elevation of HBEGF. These results suggest that ALOX12 inhibition efficiently triggers hair cuticle maturation by modulating arachidonate metabolism in concert with HBEGF.",

    "text": "Stem cells from human hair follicles: first mechanical isolation for immediate autologous clinical use in androgenetic alopecia and hair loss. BACKGROUND: Hair follicles are known to contain a well-characterized niche for adult stem cells: the bulge, which contains epithelial and melanocytic stem cells. Stem cells in the hair bulge, a clearly demarcated structure within the lower permanent portion of hair follicles, can generate the interfollicular epidermis, hair follicle structures, and sebaceous glands. The bulge epithelial stem cells can also reconstitute in an artificial in vivo system to a new hair follicle. METHODS: In this study, we have developed a new method to isolate human adult stem cells by mechanical centrifugation of punch biopsy from human hair follicles without culture condition. Here, we used human follicle stem cells (HFSCs), to improve the hair density in 11 patients (38 to 61 years old) affected by AGA in stage 3-5 as determined by the Norwood-Hamilton classification scale. RESULTS: The primary outcomes were microscopic identification and counting of HFSCs. The secondary outcomes were clinical preliminary results and safety and feasibility in HFSCs-treated scalp. Each scalp tissue suspension contained about 3, 728. 5 +-664. 5 cells. The percentage of hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells CD44 + [from dermal papilla (DP)] was about 5% + 0. 7% whereas the percentage of hair follicle epithelial stem cells CD200 + (from the bulge) was about 2. 6% + 0. 3%. In total, 23 weeks after the last treatment with HFSCs mean hair count and hair density increases over baseline values. In particular, a 29% +-5% increase in hair density for the treated area and less than a 1% increase in hair density for the placebo area. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that the isolated cells are capable to improve the hair density in patients affected by androgenetic alopecia (AGA). These cells appear to be located in the bulge area of human.",

It is well known that Panax ginseng (PG) has various pharmacological effects such as anti-aging and anti-inflammation. In a previous study, the authors identified that PG extract induced hair growth by means of a mechanism similar to that of minoxidil. In the present study, the inhibitory effect of PG extract on Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1)-induced catagen-like changes in hair follicles (HFs) was investigated in addition to the underlying mechanism of action. The effects of PG extract on cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic effect, and hair growth were observed using cultured outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes and human HFs with or without DKK-1 treatment. The PG extract significantly stimulated proliferation and inhibited apoptosis, respectively, in ORS keratinocytes. PG extract treatment affected the expression of apoptosis-related genes Bcl-2 and Bax. DKK-1 inhibited hair growth, and PG extract dramatically reversed the effect of DKK-1 on ex vivo human hair organ culture. PG extract antagonizes DKK-1-induced catagen-like changes, in part, through the regulation of apoptosis-related gene expression in HFs. These findings suggested that PG extract may reduce hair loss despite the presence of DKK-1, a strong catagen inducer via apoptosis.",

    "text": "Circulating and intraprostatic sex steroid hormonal profiles in relation to male pattern baldness and chest hair density among men diagnosed with localized prostate cancers. BACKGROUND: Prospective cohort studies of circulating sex steroid hormones and prostate cancer risk have not provided a consistent association, despite evidence from animal and clinical studies. However, studies using male pattern baldness as a proxy of early-life or cumulative androgen exposure have reported significant associations with aggressive and fatal prostate cancer risk. Given that androgens underlie the development of patterned hair loss and chest hair, we assessed whether these two dermatological characteristics were associated with circulating and intraprostatic concentrations of sex steroid hormones among men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer. METHODS: We included 248 prostate cancer patients from the NCI Prostate Tissue Study, who answered surveys and provided a pre-treatment blood sample as well as fresh frozen adjacent normal prostate tissue. Male pattern baldness and chest hair density were assessed by trained nurses before surgery. General linear models estimated geometric means and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of each hormone variable by dermatological phenotype with adjustment for potential confounding variables. Subgroup analyses were performed by Gleason score (< 7 vs > = 7) and race (European American vs. African American). RESULTS: We found strong positive associations of balding status with serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and a weak association with elevated intraprostatic testosterone. Conversely, neither circulating nor intraprostatic sex hormones were statistically significantly associated with chest hair density. Age-adjusted correlation between binary balding status and three-level chest hair density was weak (r = 0. 05). There was little evidence to suggest that Gleason score or race modified these associations. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that balding status assessed at a mean age of 60 years may serve as a clinical marker for circulating sex hormone concentrations. The weak-to-null associations between balding status and intraprostatic sex hormones reaffirm differences in organ-specific sex hormone metabolism, implying that other sex steroid hormone-related factors (eg, androgen receptor) play important roles in organ-specific androgenic actions, and that other overlapping pathways may be involved in associations between the two complex conditions.",

Importantly, it remains unclear how the two subfamilies of the five-miRNA family, distinguished by a single nucleotide within the seed region, regulate their targets. By directly ligating miRNAs to their targeted mRNA regions, we identify numerous miR-200 targets involved in the regulation of focal adhesion, actin cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and Hippo/Yap signaling. The two subfamilies bind to largely distinct target sites, but many genes are coordinately regulated by both subfamilies. Using inducible and knockout mouse models, we show that the miR-200 family regulates cell adhesion and orientation in the hair germ, contributing to precise cell fate specification and hair morphogenesis.

Using an in vitro 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, it was found that the proliferation of rat vibrissae and human hair dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) was significantly enhanced by the COK leaf extract treatment. As determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of some hair growth-related factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), and transforming growth factor-beta2 were found to be higher in the cultured hDPCs exposed to COK leaf extract than those in the untreated control group. In the hair-depilated C57BL/6 mouse model, the stimulation of hair growth was demonstrated in the group of COK leaf extract treatment. Both photographical and histological observations revealed the promotion of the anagen phase in the hair growth cycle by the COK leaf extract in the C57BL/6 mice.

Organ morphogenesis is a complex process coordinated by cell specification, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and tissue polarity. A striking example is the pattern of regularly spaced, globally aligned mammalian hair follicles, which emerges through epidermal-dermal signaling and planar polarized morphogenesis. Here, using live-imaging, we discover that developing hair follicles polarize through dramatic cell rearrangements organized in a counter-rotational pattern of cell flows. Upon hair placode induction, Shh signaling specifies a radial pattern of progenitor fates that, together with planar cell polarity, induce counter-rotational rearrangements through myosin and ROCK-dependent polarized neighbour exchanges. Importantly, these cell rearrangements also establish cell fate asymmetry by repositioning radial progenitors along the anterior-posterior axis. These movements concurrently displace associated mesenchymal cells, which then signal asymmetrically to maintain polarized cell fates. Our results demonstrate how spatial patterning and tissue polarity generate an unexpected collective cell behaviour that in turn, establishes both morphological and cell fate asymmetry.",

BACKGROUND: Despite high demand for a remedy, the treatment options for female pattern hair loss (FPHL) are limited. FPHL is frequent in postmenopausal women. In ovariectomized (OVX) mice, which lack beta-estradiol (E2) and manifest hair loss mimicking FPHL, E2 supplementation has been shown to increase hair density. However, the mechanism by which E2 exhibits its biological activity remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: To identify the downstream targets of E2 in the context of FPHL pathophysiology and discover a potential therapeutic agent for the E2-dependent subtype of FPHL. METHODS: Human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) were cultured with E2, and a microarray analysis was performed to identify the genes regulated by E2. Using OVX mice, the identified gene product was intradermally administered and then quantitative image analysis of hair density was conducted. In silico analysis to link E2 and the identified gene was performed. RESULTS: Global gene expression and bioinformatics analyses revealed that the genes associated with the angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) pathway were upregulated by E2 in hDPCs. ANGPT2 was significantly downregulated in OVX mice than in sham-operated mice (P < 0. 01). Importantly, hair density was higher in OVX mice treated with ANGPT2 than in control mice (P < 0. 05). In silico analysis showed DNA sequences with high possibility of estrogen receptor binding in the promoter region of ANGPT2. CONCLUSION: The E2-ANGPT2 axis is present in hair follicles. ANGPT2 provides a strategy for the management of E2-dependent and postmenopausal subsets of FPHL.",

BACKGROUND: Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been recognized in recent years as key regulators of biological processes. However, lincRNAs in goat remain poorly characterized both across various tissues and during different developmental stages in goat (Capra hircus). RESULTS: We performed the genome-wide discovery of the lincRNAs in goat by combining the RNA-seq dataset that were generated from 28 cashmere goat skin samples and the 12 datasets of goat tissues downloaded from the NCBI database. We identified a total of 5546 potential lincRNA transcripts that overlapped 3641 lincRNA genes. These lincRNAs exhibited a tissue-specific pattern. Specifically, there are 584 lincRNAs expressed exclusively in only one tissue, and 91 were highly expressed in hair follicle (HF). In addition, 2350 protein-coding genes and 492 lincRNAs were differentially expressed in the skin of goat. The majority exhibited the remarkable differential expression during the transition of the goat skin from the May-June to August-October time point, which covered the different seasons. Fundamental biological processes, such as skin development, were significantly enriched in these genes. Furthermore, we identified several lincRNAs highly expressed in the HF, which exhibited not only the co-expression pattern with the key factors to the HF development but also the activated expression in the August to October time point. Intriguingly, one of spatiotemporal lincRNAs, linc-chig1598 could be a potential regulator of distal-less homeobox 3 expression during the secondary hair follicle growth. CONCLUSIONS: This study will facilitate future studies aimed at unravelling the function of lincRNAs in hair follicle development.",

Patterned hair loss (PHL) affects around 50% of the adult population worldwide. The negative impact that this condition exerts on people ' s life quality has boosted the appearance of over-the-counter products endowed with hair-promoting activity. Nutraceuticals enriched in polyphenols have been recently shown to promote hair growth and counteract PHL. Malus pumila Miller cv. Annurca is an apple native to Southern Italy presenting one of the highest contents of Procyanidin B2. We have recently shown that oral consumption of Annurca polyphenolic extracts (AAE) stimulates hair growth, hair number, hair weight and keratin content in healthy human subjects. Despite its activity, the analysis of the molecular mechanism behind its hair promoting effect is still partially unclear. In this work we performed an unprecedented metabolite analysis of hair follicles (HFs) in mice topically treated with AAE. The metabolomic profile, based on a high-resolution mass spectrometry approach, revealed that AAE re-programs murine HF metabolism. AAE acts by inhibiting several NADPH dependent reactions. Glutaminolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, glutathione, citrulline and nucleotide synthesis are all halted in vivo by the treatment of HFs with AAE. On the contrary, mitochondrial respiration, beta-oxidation and keratin production are stimulated by the treatment with AAE. The metabolic shift induced by AAE spares amino acids from being oxidized, ultimately keeping them available for keratin biosynthesis.",

Hair loss is a common aesthetic disorder that can be triggered by genetic, inflammatory, hormonal, and environmental factors acting on hair follicles and their life cycle. There are several types of hair loss that differ in causes, symptoms, and spatial and temporal progression. Androgenic alopecia, a common form of hair loss, is the consequence of a decreased microcirculation of the scalp as well as the toxic action of elevated dihydrotestosterone levels on the hair bulbs. In the present study, the lotions TRINOV Lozione Anticaduta Uomo and TRINOV Lozione Anticaduta Donna, containing dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), S-equol, and propionyl-l-carnitine, were tested on 30 men and 30 women (mean age of men was 46. 6 +-6. 4 years ; mean age of women was 49. 5 +-9. 0) with signs of androgenic alopecia, respectively. DGLA is a precursor of the prostaglandin PGE1, which acts by improving microcirculation ; S-equol inhibits 5alpha-reductases, thus preventing the transformation of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone ; and propionyl-l-carnitine promotes lipid metabolism, stimulating energy production. These three molecules are loaded into liposomes for their effective transdermal delivery. Daily topical applications of the lotions resulted in a hair count that significantly increased for women and marginally increased for men after 6 months of treatment. Furthermore, significant increase in anagen hair and a significant decrease in telogen hair were observed starting from 3 months in male and 1 month in female patients. Thus, the formulations under investigation were effective in attenuating androgenic alopecia-related hair loss in men and women.",

Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is a common side effect of conventional chemotherapy and represents a major problem in clinical oncology. Even months after the end of chemotherapy, many cancer patients complain of hair loss, a condition that is psychologically difficult to manage. CIA disturbs social and sexual interactions and causes anxiety and depression. Synthetic drugs protecting from CIA and endowed with hair growth stimulatory properties are prescribed with caution by oncologists. Hormones, growth factors, morphogens could unwontedly protect tumour cells or induce cancer cell proliferation and are thus considered incompatible with many chemotherapy regimens. Nutraceuticals, on the contrary, have been shown to be safe and effective treatment options for hair loss. We here show that polyphenols from Malus Pumila Miller cv Annurca are endowed with hair growth promoting activity and can be considered a safe alternative to avoid CIA. In vitro, Annurca Apple Polyphenolic Extract (AAE) protects murine Hair Follicles (HF) from taxanes induced dystrophy. Moreover, in virtue of its mechanism of action, AAE is herein proven to be compatible with chemotherapy regimens. AAE forces HFs to produce ATP using mitochondrial beta-oxidation, reducing Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) rate and nucleotides production. As consequence, DNA replication and mitosis are not stimulated, while a pool of free amino acids usually involved in catabolic reactions are spared for keratin production. Moreover, measuring the effect exerted on Poly Unsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) metabolism, we prove that AAE promotes hair-growth by increasing the intracellular levels of Prostaglandins F2alpha (PGF2alpha) and by hijacking PUFA catabolites toward beta-oxidation.",

BACKGROUND: The hair follicle represents a significant penetration route for topically applied substances. ISSUE: The percutaneous absorption of substances can be significantly increased and accelerated by the involvement of hair follicles. In addition, nanoparticles have the characteristic to penetrate deeply and effectively into the hair follicles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An optimization of drug delivery for topically applied substances is possible if the nanoparticles act solely as a carrier to transport active ingredients into the hair follicle. Once the nanocarrier has penetrated into the hair follicle, the active substance must be released there. This can be triggered by various mechanisms. RESULTS: The released drug can thus pass into the living tissue surrounding the hair follicle independently. With the help of this innovative strategy, the bioavailability of topically applied substances can be significantly improved. CONCLUSION: The transport of active ingredients into the hair follicles with the help of particles and the release of active substances there is a very effective new method for transporting active substances through the skin barrier.",

There have been many studies about the formation, storage, transport and degradation of melanosomes in epidermal melanocytes but studies of melanocytes and melanosomes in fetal hair follicles (HFs) have been limited and ambiguous. The goal of this study was to investigate the distribution of melanocytes and the degradation of melanosomes in fetal HFs. After obtaining approval and informed consent for the study, a scalp specimen from a 5 month gestational age fetus was obtained and was divided into two parts. One part was subjected to immunohistochemical staining with the melanocyte-specific marker HMB-45 and was then observed by light microscopy to detect the distribution of melanocytes in HFs. The other part underwent conventional processing for transmission electron microcopy (TEM). Subsequently, the morphology of melanosomes in HF melanocytes and their degradation in cortical keratinocytes were observed. Immunohistochemically, scattered round melanocytes lacking dendrites were mainly observed along the outer root sheath of the lower part of the HF. A few fusiform or tri-dendritic melanocytes were located at the bottom of the hair bulbs. Significantly melanized melanocytes with multiple dendrites were concentrated in the pigmented area in the center of the hair bulbs, only above the dermal papilla. Analysis by TEM revealed melanocytes containing melanosomes at all stages of development. Autophagosomes containing stage mature IV melanosomes were observed in some melanocytes. Many phagolysosomes containing numerous melanosomes were observed in the cortical keratinocytes. Some phagolysosomes were concentrically surrounded by 3-5 layers of endoplasmic reticulum. Melanosomes that had been degraded or were being degraded in phagolysosomes in keratinocytes had lost their integrity and had become an ill-defined melanosomal dust that were arranged irregularly. Partial melanin particles were released into the cytosol. Melanocytes in different regions of fetal HFs had different morphologies and were at various stages of differentiation. Fetal HF melanocytes contained not only melanosomes at different developmental stages, but autophagosomes were seen occasionally. Melanosomes were degraded into irregular pigment particles in the phagolysosomes of cortical keratinocytes. These results provide important clues to elucidate the mechanism of melanosome biodegradation.",

Current opinion views androgens as the pathogenic driver in the miniaturization of hair follicles of androgenetic alopecia by interfering with the dermal papilla. This cannot be the sole cause and therefore it is important for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes to identify additional pathways. Comparative full transcriptome profile analysis of the hair bulb region of normal and miniaturized hair follicles from vertex and occipital region in males with and without androgenetic alopecia revealed that next to the androgen receptor as well the retinoid receptor and particularly the PPAR pathway is involved in progressive hair miniaturization. We demonstrate the concurrent up-regulation of PPARGC1a in the epithelial compartment and androgen receptor in the dermal papilla of miniaturized hair. Dynamic Ppargc1a expression in the mouse hair cycle suggests a possible role in regulating hair growth and differentiation. This is supported by reduced proliferation of human dermal papilla and predominantly epithelial keratinocytes after incubation with AICAR, the agonist for AMPK signaling which activates PPARGC1a and serves as co-activator of PPARgamma.

BACKGROUND: Nestin, which was originally described as a neural crest stem cell marker, is known to be expressed in bulge follicle cells of human, canine and murine anagen hairs. However, the capacity of nestin-expressing cells to differentiate into the components of the hair follicle or the epidermis has been insufficiently investigated. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To determine whether nestin-expressing cells are capable of differentiating into keratinocytes. ANIMALS/MATERIALS: A double-transgenic mouse line Nes-Cre/CAG-CAT-EGFP, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is expressed upon Cre-based recombination driven by the nestin promoter. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The tissue distribution of EGFP + and nestin + cells in the skin of the mouse line was analysed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses. RESULTS: EGFP + cells were recognized in the outer epithelial cell layers of anagen and telogen hair follicles, but rarely seen in the interfollicular epidermis. The EGFP + cells in the outer layers of the hair follicles coexpressed keratin 14, a marker of the outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes, but not trichohyalin granules, an inner root sheath keratinocyte cell marker. Immunostaining for nestin failed to detect its expression in the majority of hair follicle epithelial cells, suggesting that the EGFP + cells in the ORS were derived from nestin-expressing progenitor cells that had become further committed along the epithelial cell lineage, where nestin is no longer expressed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: These results suggest that progenitor cells that differentiate into ORS keratinocytes are distinct from those for other hair follicle or epidermal components and provide implications for regenerative medicine and the molecular classification of hair follicle tumours.",

The undercoat fiber of the cashmere goat, from the secondary hair follicle (HF), possesses commercial value. However, very few studies have focused on the molecular details of primary and secondary HF initiation and development in goat embryos. In this study, skin samples at embryonic day 45, 55, and 65 (E45, E55, and E65) were collected and prepared for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found that the HF probably initiated from E55 to E65 by analyzing the functional pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Most key genes in canonical signaling pathways, including WNT, TGF-beta, FGF, Hedgehog, NOTCH, and other factors showed clear expression changes from E55 to E65. We, for the first time, explored alternative splicing (AS) alterations, which showed distinct patterns among these three stages. Functional pathways of AS-regulated genes showed connections to HF development. By comparing the published RNA-seq samples from the E60, E120, and newborn (NB) stages, we found the majority of WNT/beta-catenin signaling genes were important in the initiation of HF development, while other factors including FOXN1, GATA3, and DLX3 may have a consistent influence on HF development. Our investigation supported the time points of embryonic HF initiation and identified genes that have potential functions of embryonic HF initiation and development. We further explored the potential regulatory roles of AS in HF initiation, which extended our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of HF development.",

Purpose: Our aim was to evaluate whether mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage in hair bulbs could be a suitable biomarker for the detection of local exposure to ionizing radiation. Materials and methods: Mouse hair was collected 4 and 24 hours, 3 and 10 days after single whole-body exposure to 0, 0. 1, and 2 Gy radiation. Pubic hair (treated area) and scalp hair (control area) were collected from 13 prostate cancer patients before and after fractioned radiotherapy with an average total dose of 2. 7 Gy to follicles after five fractions. Unspecified lesion frequency of mtDNA was analyzed with long PCR, large mtDNA deletion levels were tested with real-time PCR. Results: Unspecified lesion frequency of mtDNA significantly increased in mouse hair 24 hours after irradiation with 2 Gy, but variance among samples was high. No increase in lesion frequency could be detected after 0. 1 Gy irradiation. In prostate cancer patients, there was no significant change in either the unspecified lesion frequency or in the proportion of 4934-bp deleted mtDNA in pubic hair after radiotherapy. The proportions of murine 3860-bp common deletion, human 4977-bp common deletion and 7455-bp deleted mtDNA were too low to be analyzed reliably.

Cantu syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder, first described by Cantu in 1982, that is characterized by congenital hypertrichosis, characteristic facial anomalies and cardiomegaly. Recent investigations have revealed that this syndrome is caused by mutations of ABCC9, which encodes a regulatory subunit of SUR2, an adenosine triphosphate-mediated potassium channel opener, expressed not only in smooth muscle but also in hair follicles. However, the abnormalities of skin and hair in patients with Cantu syndrome have not been well explored. We herein report three Japanese patients with Cantu syndrome and describe their specific skin manifestations and alterations in the histopathology of their hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Similar alterations were shared among those three patients and may be related to the function of SUR2, namely the regulation of hair follicle growth, because SUR2 is a known pharmacological target of minoxidil.",

The transcriptome profile and differential gene expression in telogen and late anagen microdissected hair follicles and the interfollicular epidermis of healthy dogs was investigated by using RNAseq. The genes with the highest expression levels in each group were identified and genes known from studies in other species to be associated with structure and function of hair follicles and epidermis were evaluated. Transcriptome profiling revealed that late anagen follicles expressed mainly keratins and telogen follicles expressed GSN and KRT15. The interfollicular epidermis expressed predominately genes encoding for proteins associated with differentiation. All sample groups express genes encoding for proteins involved in cellular growth and signal transduction. The expression pattern of skin-associated genes in dogs is similar to humans. Differences in expression compared to mice and humans include BMP2 expression mainly in telogen and high KRT17 expression in the interfollicular epidermis of dogs. Our data provide the basis for the investigation of the structure and function of canine skin or skin disease and support the use of dogs as a model for human cutaneous disease by assigning gene expression to specific tissue states.",

Accordingly, gene sequencing is recommended for the investigation of hair regeneration between 2D and 3D culture, the three groups were established including DPCs in passage 2 in 2D culture, DPCs in passage 8 in 2D culture and DPCs in passage 8 in 3D culture. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the Venn diagram of these three groups, which included 1642 known and 359 novel genes, respectively. A total of 1642 known genes were used for Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Gene, Genomic Encyclopedia (KEGG) pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses, respectively. The functions and pathways of DEGs were enriched in biological regulation, signal transduction and immune system, etc. The key module and the top 10 hub genes (IL1B, CXCL12, HGF, EGFR, APP, CCL2, PTGS2, MMP9, NGF and SPP1) were also identified using the Cytoscape application. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR results of the three groups validated that the hub genes were crucial for hair growth.

Vertebrate Hox genes are critical for the establishment of structures during the development of the main body axis. Subsequently, they play important roles either in organizing secondary axial structures such as the appendages, or during homeostasis in postnatal stages and adulthood. Here, we set up to analyze their elusive function in the ectodermal compartment, using the mouse limb bud as a model. We report that the HoxC gene cluster was co-opted to be transcribed in the distal limb ectoderm, where it is activated following the rule of temporal colinearity. These ectodermal cells subsequently produce various keratinized organs such as nails or claws. Accordingly, deletion of the HoxC cluster led to mice lacking nails (anonychia), a condition stronger than the previously reported loss of function of Hoxc13, which is the causative gene of the ectodermal dysplasia 9 (ECTD9) in human patients. We further identified two mammalian-specific ectodermal enhancers located upstream of the HoxC gene cluster, which together regulate Hoxc gene expression in the hair and nail ectodermal organs. Deletion of these regulatory elements alone or in combination revealed a strong quantitative component in the regulation of Hoxc genes in the ectoderm, suggesting that these two enhancers may have evolved along with the mammalian taxon to provide the level of HOXC proteins necessary for the full development of hair and nail.",

Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease manifesting varying degrees of hair loss. Rapidly progressive AA (RP-AA) is a severe subtype of AA and often resistant to skin-directed treatments. i. v. corticosteroid pulse therapy has been applied for RP-AA ; however, the treatment outcome can only become evaluable several months after the intervention, discomposing the patients. In this study, we attempted to develop a scoring system to predict treatment outcomes based on statistical correlations between newly identified predictors and the recovery rates calculated by digital image analysis. Thirty RP-AA patients (15 men and 15 women) who underwent pulse therapy and demonstrated total hair loss during the clinical course were included. The percentages of hair regrowth (% HR) at 6 months after the treatment were quantitatively calculated by image analysis software. The correlation between% HR and clinicopathological and immunological variables were statistically assessed. The analysis identified four confirmatory contributors including female sex (P = 0. 015), absence of previous AA history (P = 0. 02), lower peripheral blood eosinophil count (P = 0. 02) and mild to moderate cell infiltration around the hair bulb (P = 0. 034), together with a potential contributor, namely absence of atopic dermatitis in their medical history (P = 0. 08). The scoring system was developed by double counting confirmatory variables and single counting a potential variable. Importantly, the scores obtained by this system demonstrated significant correlation with% HR (r = 0. 61, P < 0. 001). The usefulness of this scoring system was further validated by assessing additional 20 cases of RP-AA. When combined with a recently published algorithm for early detection of self-healing subset, the current scoring system may help strategize the therapeutic approach for RP-AA.",

    "text": "Female Pattern Hair Loss: Why the Follicular Unit Transplantation Surgical Technique Remains a Good Option. BACKGROUND: Female pattern hair loss is a common nonscarring alopecia that can present with several patterns of decreased hair density. The condition is very bothersome to affected women, and although there are multiple nonsurgical options, surgical follicular unit transplantation remains one of the most effective options. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of the senior author ' s (C. O. U.) experience and technique of follicular unit transplantation for treatment of female pattern hair loss. RESULTS: A total of 751 patients with female pattern hair loss underwent follicular unit transplantation over the past 31 years. Average patient age was 48 years. Patients with small areas of hair loss made up 40 percent of the group (Ludwig stage I), those with medium-sized areas constituted 45 percent (Ludwig stage II), and those with large areas constituted 15 percent (Ludwig stage III). The average operative time was 3 hours 21 minutes. One hundred thirty-five patients (18 percent) underwent a second replacement, at an average period of 4 years after the procedure, because of the progressive nature of female pattern hair loss. Complications included donor-site scar widening in six patients and folliculitis in 17 patients. CONCLUSION: Follicular unit transplantation is an excellent option for treatment of female pattern hair loss patients, as there is no need to shave the recipient sites, operative times are shorter than for follicular unit excision techniques, and the incidence of complications is very low.

Hair follicle stem cells are pluripotent and have a self-renewal capacity and multi-differentiation potential in vitro. As hair follicle stem cells can be easily sampled from the skin and hair of clinical patients at a considerable quantity, these cells have potential applications in wound repair and skin tissue engineering. Effective approaches for the in vitro culture and amplification of mouse hair follicle stem cells, as well as the in vitro osteogenic differentiation potential and cell source when obtaining mouse-separated cells were examined. Serial subculture was performed in different culture systems. Cell source was detected based on the relevant surface markers derived from mouse hair follicles at the gene and protein levels, and the differential potential was determined. The proliferative ability of hair follicle-derived stem cells obtained from mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)/keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSF)-conditioned medium was the highest among all culture systems. The induced group had a stronger osteogenic differentiation potential compared with the non-induced group, indicating that the cells obtained from MEF/KSF-conditioned medium were cells derived from the hair follicle dermal papilla. Therefore, the strong osteogenic differentiation potential of the hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells was screened with MEF/KSF-conditioned culture medium following amplification, and biological characteristics similar to those of hair follicle dermal papilla cells were observed.",

Investigations of hereditary phenotypes in spontaneous mutants may help to better understand the physiological functions of the altered genes. We investigated two unrelated domestic shorthair cats with bulbous swellings of the hair shafts. The clinical, histopathological, and ultrastructural features were similar to those in mice with lanceolate hair phenotype caused by loss-of-function variants in Dsg4 encoding desmoglein 4. We sequenced the genomes from both affected cats and compared the data of each affected cat to 61 control genomes. A search for private homozygous variants in the DSG4 candidate gene revealed independent frameshift variants in each case, c. 76del or p. Ile26fsLeu * 4 in case no. 1 and c. 1777del or p. His593Thrfs * 23 in case no. 2. DSG4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein located primarily in the extracellular part of desmosomes, a complex of adhesion molecules responsible for connecting the keratin intermediate filaments of neighbouring epithelial cells. Desmosomes are essential for normal hair shaft formation. Both identified DSG4 variants in the affected cats lead to premature stop codons and truncate major parts of the open-reading frame. We assume that this leads to a complete loss of DSG4 function, resulting in an incorrect formation of the desmosomes and causing the development of defective hair shafts. Together with the knowledge on the effects of DSG4 variants in other species, our data suggest that the identified DSG4 variants cause the hair shaft dystrophy. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first report of pathogenic DSG4 variants in domestic animals.",

In this study, an immunocompetent model for wound healing was employed using a syngeneic murine cell line of mesenchymal stem cells cultured from the mouse whisker hair follicle outer root sheath (named moMSCORS). moMSCORS were isolated using an air-liquid interface method, expanded in vitro and characterized according to the MSC definition criteria-cell viability, in vitro proliferation, MSC phenotype and multi-lineage differentiations. Moreover, upon applying moMSCORS in an in vivo full-thickness wound model in the syngeneic C57BL/6 mice, the treated wounds displayed different morphology to that of the untreated wound beds. Quantitative evaluation of angiogenesis, granulation and wound closure involving clinical scoring and software-based quantification indicated a lower degree of inflammation in the treated wounds. Histological staining of treated wounds by the means of H & E, Alcian Blue, PicroSirius Red and alphaSMA immune labelling showed lower cellularity, less collagen filaments as well as thinner dermal and epidermal layers compared with the untreated wounds, indicating a general reduction of hypertrophic scars.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are the structurally similar and highly conserved type of functional proteins that play an important role in hair follicle growth and development. BMP7 was a differentially expressed gene in different patterns of Hu sheep lambskin identified using Agilent microarray. Since hair follicle is the basis of pattern formation of lambskin, and its growth and development is governed by dermal papilla cells (DPCs), to clarify the role of BMP7 and hair follicle, our study was designed to investigate the regulation between BMP7 and DPCs. Firstly, the CDS region of BMP7 was cloned by 3 ' Race and PCR in Hu sheep and performed serious of bioinformatic analysis. Then, the effects of BMP7 on DPCs were analyzed after overexpression and interference of BMP7 in dermal papilla cells by CCK8, EdU, and PI assay. Additionally, qPCR was also conducted to clarify the relationship between BMP7 and the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. A total of 1296 bp of the BMP7 CDS region sequence was sucessfully cloned in Hu sheep, encoding a signal peptide of 431 amino acids, molecular weight was 49, 316. 9 Da and the isoelectric point (Pi) was 7. 75. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of BMP7 revealed that Hu sheep had high homology with Bos taurus, Homo sapiens, and Canis lupus familiaris. Structure domain prediction showed that TGF-beta superfamily domain exist between 330th-431th amino acid, BMP7 protein is a secreted protein. In BMP7 up-regulated DPCs, DPCs proliferation rate and cell cycle were significantly higher than that of NC group (p < 0. 05). Meanwhile, the expression level of Smad3, Smad4, Samd6, and TGF-beta1 in TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway were significantly lower than that in NC group (p < 0. 05). In BMP7 down-regulated DPCs, it presented the opposite result. In conclusion, our study showed that BMP7 had a positive effect on DPCs by accelerating the proliferation and cell cycle of DPCs, and hypothesized that regulate hair follicles growth and development via TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. These findings may provide a synergistic target for the subsequent research of hair follicle growth and development.",

Skin and hair follicle stem cell biology is the focus of increasing interest, not least because the adult hair follicle has well defined dermal and epithelial populations that display distinct developmental properties. Recent evidence suggests that a number of adult cell populations have much broader stem cell capabilities than previously thought. To examine whether this applied to the hair follicle, and with a view to developing the follicle as a stem cell model system we investigated whether adult hair follicles were capable of demonstrating haematopoietic stem cell activity. To investigate haematopoietic activity in hair follicles we first used in vitro haematopoietic colony assays. This demonstrated that rodent hair follicle end bulbs as well as micro-dissected dermal papilla and dermal sheath cells actively produced cells of erythroid and myeloid lineages but that follicle epithelial cells did not. As a more stringent test, we then transplanted cultured dermal papilla or dermal sheath cells from transgenically marked donor mice into lethally irradiated recipient mice and observed multi-lineage haematopoietic reconstitution when assayed at intervals of up to one year. Colony assays from bone marrow of primary recipients revealed that over 70% of clonogenic precursors were derived from donor hair follicle cells. When bone marrow from primary mice was harvested and used to repopulate secondary myeloablated recipients, multi-lineage haematopoietic engraftment was observed. Our data show that dermal but not epidermal compartments of the adult hair follicle have much broader stem cell activities than previously described. Although the treatment for many forms of blood disorder, such as leukemia, often requires transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSC), their availability can be rate limiting.

    "text": "Plasticity of hair follicle dermal cells in wound healing and induction. The capacity of adult hair follicle dermal cells to participate in new follicle induction and regeneration, and to elicit responses from diverse epithelial partners, demonstrates a level of developmental promiscuity and influence far exceeding that of interfollicular fibroblasts. We have recently suggested that adult follicle dermal cells have extensive stem or progenitor cell activities, including an important role in skin dermal wound healing. Given that up to now tissue engineered skin equivalents have several deficiencies, including the absence of hair follicles, we investigated the capacity of follicle dermal cells to be incorporated into skin wounds ; to form hair follicles in wound environments ; and to create a hair follicle-derived skin equivalent. In our study, we implanted rat follicle dermal cells labelled with a vital dye into ear and body skin wounds. We found that they were incorporated into the new dermis in a manner similar to skin fibroblasts, but that lower follicle dermal sheath also assimilated into hair follicles. Using different combinations of follicle dermal cells and outer root sheath epithelial cells in punch biopsy wounds, we showed that new hair follicles were formed only with the inclusion of intact dermal papillae. Finally by combining follicle dermal sheath and outer root sheath cells in organotypic chambers, we created a skin equivalent with characteristic dermal and epidermal architecture and a normal basement membrane-the first skin to be produced entirely from hair follicle cells. These data support the hypothesis that follicle dermal cells may be important in wound healing and demonstrate their potential usefulness in human skin equivalents and skin substitutes. While we have made progress towards producing skin equivalents that contain follicles, we suggest that the failure of cultured dermal papilla cells to induce follicle formation in wounds illustrates the complex role the follicle dermis may play in skin. We believe that it demonstrates a genuine dichotomy of activity for follicle cells within skin.",

Here, we provide the first study of prolactin (PRL) and prolactin receptor (PRLR) expression during the nonseasonal murine hair cycle, which is, in contrast to sheep, comparable with the human scalp and report that both PRL and PRLR are stringently restricted to the hair follicle epithelium and are strongly hair cycle-dependent. In addition we show that PRL exerts functional effects on anagen hair follicles in murine skin organ culture by down-regulation of proliferation in follicular keratinocytes. In telogen follicles, PRL-like immunoreactivity was detected in outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes. During early anagen (III to IV), the developing inner root sheath (IRS) and the surrounding ORS were positive for PRL. In later anagen stages, PRL could be detected in the proximal IRS and the inner layer of the ORS. The regressing (catagen) follicle showed a strong expression of PRL in the proximal ORS. In early anagen, PRLR immunoreactivity occurred in the distal part of the ORS around the developing IRS, and subsequently to a restricted area of the more distal ORS during later anagen stages and during early catagen. The dermal papilla (DP) stayed negative for both PRL and PRLR throughout the cycle. Telogen follicles showed only a very weak PRLR staining of ORS keratinocytes. The long-form PRLR transcript was shown by real-time polymerase chain reaction to be transiently down-regulated during early anagen, whereas PRL transcripts were up-regulated during mid anagen. Addition of PRL (400 ng/ml) to anagen hair follicles in murine skin organ culture for 72 hours induced premature catagen development in vitro along with a decline in the number of proliferating hair bulb keratinocytes. These data support the intriguing concept that PRL is generated locally in the hair follicle epithelium and acts directly in an autocrine or paracrine manner to modulate the hair cycle.",

Within stratified squamous epithelia, such as the epidermis, desmogleins are generally expressed in a differentiation-specific manner. Similar to the epidermis, the hair follicle is compartmentalized into a hierarchy of cell types based on their level of differentiation. Relatively undifferentiated stem cells in the bulge can generate epidermis, sebaceous gland, and hair bulb matrix cells. The latter give rise to at least six different cell types that keratinize as they move up the hair shaft and inner root sheath. Here, we examined expression patterns of the desmoglein isotypes, desmogleins 1, 2, and 3 in the cutaneous epithelium, and discovered that desmoglein 1 and 2 expression correlated with the state of differentiation of defined populations within the hair follicle. Desmoglein 2 was highly expressed by the least differentiated cells of the cutaneous epithelium, including the hair follicle bulge of the fetus and adult, bulb matrix cells, and basal layer of the outer root sheath. In contrast, desmoglein 1 defined more differentiated cell populations, and was expressed in epidermal suprabasal cells, the inner root sheath, and the innermost layers of the outer root sheath. We found that the expression pattern of desmoglein 3 correlated with different types of keratinization. In areas of trichilemmal keratinization in the follicle, and in cysts arising from these areas, desmoglein 3 was expressed throughout all layers of the outer root sheath and cyst wall. In areas of epidermal-like keratinization, such as in the infundibulum and in epidermal inclusion cysts, desmoglein 3 expression was limited mainly to the basal layer. We conclude that desmoglein expression patterns define compartments of cells in similar states of differentiation within the cutaneous epithelium, and reveal a hierarchy of differentiation among these compartments.",

Hair follicles are of special interest because our understanding of hair follicle biology and pathophysiology has progressed significantly in recent years, and we now have a much better understanding of how genes, encoding transcription factors, growth factors, and cytokines regulate both hair follicle development and the cycles of hair follicle growth (anagen, catagen, and telogen) (Cotsarelis and Millar, 2001 ; Millar, 2002). Also important is the characterization of an increasing number of genetic mutations that affect hair growth and can result in hair loss (Cotsarelis and Millar, 2001). Gene therapy could be used to introduce genes that manipulate hair follicle growth and cycling or that replace the mutated defective gene with a normal wild-type gene. As our understanding of the polygenic basis for a number of alopecias improves, gene-based therapies might also be designed to provide more promising treatments than current palliative therapies for hair loss.

The highest hair follicle density and percentage of follicular orifices on the skin surface and infundibular surface were found on the forehead, whereas the highest average size of the follicular orifices was measured in the calf region. The highest infundibular volume and therefore a potential follicular reservoir was calculated for the forehead and for the calf region, although the calf region showed the lowest hair follicle density. The calculated follicular volume of these two skin areas was as high as the estimated reservoir of the stratum corneum. The lowest values for every other parameter were found on the forearm. The present investigation clearly contradicts former hypothesis that the amount of appendages of the total skin surface represents not more than 0. 1%.

When beta-catenin signalling is disturbed from mid-gestation onwards lineage commitment is profoundly altered in postnatal mouse epidermis. We have investigated whether adult epidermis has the capacity for beta-catenin-induced lineage conversion without prior embryonic priming. We fused N-terminally truncated, stabilised beta-catenin to the ligand-binding domain of a mutant oestrogen receptor (DeltaNbeta-cateninER). DeltaNbeta-cateninER was expressed in the epidermis of transgenic mice under the control of the keratin 14 promoter and beta-catenin activity was induced in adult epidermis by topical application of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT). Within 7 days of daily 4OHT treatment resting hair follicles were recruited into the hair growth cycle and epithelial outgrowths formed from existing hair follicles and from interfollicular epidermis. The outgrowths expressed Sonic hedgehog, Patched and markers of hair follicle differentiation, indicative of de novo follicle formation. The interfollicular epidermal differentiation program was largely unaffected but after an initial wave of sebaceous gland duplication sebocyte differentiation was inhibited. A single application of 4OHT was as effective as repeated doses in inducing new follicles and growth of existing follicles. Treatment of epidermis with 4OHT for 21 days resulted in conversion of hair follicles to benign tumours resembling trichofolliculomas. The tumours were dependent on continuous activation of beta-catenin and by 28 days after removal of the drug they had largely regressed. We conclude that interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous glands retain the ability to be reprogrammed in adult life and that continuous beta-catenin signalling is required to maintain hair follicle tumours.",

The proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides, ACTH and alpha-MSH, are the principal mediators of human skin pigmentation via their action at the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC-1R). Recent data have demonstrated the existence of a functionally active beta-endorphin/mu-opiate receptor system in both epidermal and hair follicle melanocytes, whereby beta-endorphin can regulate melanogenesis, dendricity, and proliferation in these cells. However, a role for ACTH and alpha-MSH in the regulation of the human follicular pigmentary unit has not been determined. This study was designed to examine the involvement of ACTH and the alpha-MSH/MC-1R system in human follicular melanocyte biology. To address this question we employed RT-PCR and immunohisto/cytochemistry, and a functional role for these POMC peptides was assessed in follicular melanocyte cultures. Human scalp hair follicle melanocytes synthesized and processed POMC. ACTH and alpha-MSH in association with their processing enzymes and MC-1R are expressed in human follicular melanocytes at the message level in vitro and at the protein level both in situ and in vitro. The expression of the POMC/MC-1R receptor system was confined only to subpopulations of poorly and moderately differentiated melanocytes. In addition, functional studies revealed that ACTH and alpha-MSH are able to promote follicular melanocyte differentiation by up-regulating melanogenesis, dendricity, and proliferation in less differentiated melanocyte subpopulations. Thus, these findings suggest a role for these POMC peptides in regulating human hair follicle melanocyte differentiation.",

The gene underlying the phenotype of both finnegan and defolliculated has been mapped to chromosome 11 and here we show that both mice harbor mutations in gasdermin 3 (Gsdm3), a gene of unknown function.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that gasdermins are expressed specifically in cells at advanced stages of differentiation in the upper epidermis, the differentiating inner root sheath and hair shaft and in the most mature sebocytes of the sebaceous gland and preputial, meibomium, ceruminous gland, and anal glands.

Diffuse hair loss ranks among the most frequent and psychologically most distressing adverse effects of systemic therapy with retinoids, which severely limits their therapeutic use even where clinically desired. Since the underlying mechanisms of retinoid-induced effluvium are as yet unknown, we have investigated the influence of the prototypic retinoid all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, tretinoin) on the growth of human scalp hair follicles (HF) in culture. HF in the anagen VI stage of the hair cycle were cultured in the presence of 10 (-8) or 10 (-10) M ATRA. Compared with controls, hair shaft elongation declined significantly already after 2 d in the ATRA-treated group, and approximately 80% of the ATRA-treated HF had prematurely entered catagen-like stage at day 6, compared with 30% in the control group. This corresponded to an upregulation of apoptotic and a downregulation of Ki67-positive cells in ATRA-treated HF. Since transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has been implicated as a key inducer of catagen, we next studied whether ATRA treatment had any effect on follicular expression. TGF-beta2 immunoreactivity was detected in the outer root sheath of anagen VI scalp HF. In catagen follicles, TGF-beta2 was also expressed in the regressing epithelial strand. After 4 d of ATRA treatment, TGF-beta2 was significantly upregulated in anagen HF in the dermal papilla (DP) and the dermal sheath, 7, and TGF-beta neutralizing antibody partially abrogated at RA induced hair growth inhibition. Real-time PCR confirmed a significant upregulation of TGF-beta2 transcripts in ATRA-treated hair bulbs. This study is the first to provide direct evidence that ATRA can indeed induce a catagen-like stage in human HF and suggests that this occurs, at least in part, via upregulation of TGF-beta2 in the DP.

The in loco factory for melanin formation is the hair follicle melanocyte, but it is common knowledge that melanogenesis results from a fine tuned concerted interaction between the cells of the entire dermal papilla in the anagen hair follicle. The key enzyme is tyrosinase to initiate the active pigmentation machinery. Hence, an intricate understanding from transcription of mRNA to enzyme activity, including enzyme kinetics, substrate supply, optimal pH, cAMP signaling, is a must. Moreover, the role of reactive oxygen species on enzyme regulation and functionality needs to be taken into account. So far our knowledge on the entire hair cycle relies on the murine model of the C57BL/6 mouse. Whether this data can be translated into humans still needs to be shown.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) exert their biological and therapeutical actions through the GC receptor (GR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Synthetic GC derivatives are widely prescribed for treating numerous cutaneous inflammatory and immune diseases due to their great efficacy. However, chronic treatment with GCs produces adverse side-effects including skin atrophy, delayed wound healing, and in certain cases, GC resistance. The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic actions of the GR in skin have been extensively studied ; in contrast, the role of GR as a modulator of epidermal development and homeostasis has received less attention. The ubiquitous functional inactivation of GR results in defective epidermal formation although the underlying mechanisms have not been fully characterized. The use of transcriptomic approaches both in vitro and in vivo allowed the identification of genes that are regulated by GR in developing and adult skin. A main goal to understand the role of GR in skin biology is to identify primary transcriptional targets as well as the signaling pathways mediating GR action. Furthermore, it will be important to decipher the contribution of GR in the different cellular compartments of the skin, including keratinocytes of the interfollicular epidermis and hair follicles, and their respective stem cell progenitors. Additionally, recent findings indicating that the skin acts as a true peripheral endocrine organ implies greater complexity than originally thought. The local production of GCs and other steroid hormones should be considered as a modulator of skin function under homeostatic and diseased conditions. Finally, studying GR function in skin should take into account that the mineralocorticoid receptor may also mediate GC actions and/or regulate transcription either by itself or in combination with GR. Addressing these issues should help to elucidate the mechanisms by which Gr contributes to establishment of a competent epidermal barrier and may also have implications in the context of dermatological treatments based on GC-analogs.",

Although the signaling molecules involved in the anagen and anagen-catagen transition have been studied extensively, the signaling that controls telogen is only partly understood. Here we show that fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) 18 is expressed in a hair stem cell niche throughout telogen, and that it regulates the hair cycle through the non-growth phases. When the Fgf18 gene is conditionally knocked out in keratin 5-positive epithelial cells in mice, telogen becomes very short, giving rise to a strikingly rapid succession of hair cycles. In wild-type mice, hair follicle growth during anagen is strongly suppressed by local delivery of FGF18 protein. Our results demonstrate that epithelial FGF18 signaling and its reduction in the milieu of hair stem cells are crucial for the maintenance of resting and growth phase, respectively.",

Herein, we report that recombinant human DKK-1 (rhDKK-1) injection into the hypodermis of mice during anagen caused premature onset of catagen, whereas neutralizing DKK-1 antibody delayed anagen-to-catagen transition in mice. Moreover, treatment with rhDKK-1 led to a decrease in final hair follicle length, whereas DKK-1 antibody led to an increase compared with control animals. In addition, DKK-1 and DKK-1 messenger RNA expression is most upregulated in follicular keratinocytes of late anagen in depilation-induced hair cycle progression. Moreover, we observed that rhDKK-1 blocks canonical Wnt-mediated activation of beta-catenin signaling and induces the proapoptotic protein Bax, resulting in apoptosis in outer root sheath keratinocytes.

UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: A comprehensive understanding of the equine circadian clock involves the evaluation of circadian clock gene expression. A non-invasive and effective method for detecting equine clock gene expression has yet to be established. Currently, research surrounding this area has relied on collecting tissue biopsies or blood samples that can often be costly, time consuming and uncomfortable for the animal. METHODS: Five mares were individually stabled under a light-dark (LD) cycle that mimicked the external environmental photoperiod during a time of year corresponding with the vernal equinox. Hair follicles were collected every 4 h over a 24-h period by plucking hairs from the mane. RNA was extracted and quantitative (q) PCR assays were performed to determine temporal expression patterns for the core clock genes ; ARNTL, CRY1, PER1, PER2, NR1D2 and the clock controlled gene, DBP. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA for the clock gene transcripts PER1 and PER2 and the clock controlled gene, DBP, revealed significant variation in expression over time (p <. 05, respectively). Cosinor analysis confirmed a significant 24-h temporal component for PER1 (p =. 002) and DBP (p =. 0033) and also detected rhythmicity for NR1D2 (p =. 0331). CONCLUSIONS: We show that the extraction of RNA from equine hair follicle cells can identify the circadian 24 h oscillations of specific clock genes and a clock-controlled gene and therefore provide a valuable non-invasive method for evaluating the equine peripheral circadian clock. This method will serve as a useful tool for future evaluations of equine circadian rhythms and their response to environmental changes.",

In most mammals, each hair follicle undergoes a cyclic process of growing, regressing and resting phases (anagen, catagen, telogen, respectively) called the hair cycle. Various biological factors have been reported to regulate or to synchronize with the hair cycle. Some factors involved in the extracellular matrix, which is a major component of skin tissue, are also thought to regulate the hair cycle. We have focused on an enzyme that degrades elastin, which is associated with skin elasticity. Since our previous study identified skin fibroblast elastase as neprilysin (NEP), we examined the fluctuation of NEP enzyme activity and its expression during the synchronized hair cycle of rats. NEP activity in the skin was elevated at early anagen, and decreased during catagen to telogen. The expression of NEP mRNA and protein levels was modulated similarly. Immunostaining showed changes in NEP localization throughout the hair cycle, from the follicular epithelium during early anagen to the dermal papilla during catagen. To determine whether NEP plays an important role in regulating the hair cycle, we used a specific inhibitor of NEP (NPLT). NPLT was applied topically daily to the dorsal skin of C3H mice, which had been depilated in advance. Mice treated with NPLT had significantly suppressed hair growth. These data suggest that NEP plays an important role in regulating the hair cycle by its increased expression and activity in the follicular epithelium during early anagen.",

To find clues about the mechanism by which kinase C epsilon (PKC epsilon) may impart susceptibility to ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), we compared PKC epsilon transgenic (TG) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates for (1) the effects of UVR exposures on percent of putative hair follicle stem cells (HSCs) and (2) HSCs proliferation. The percent of double HSCs (CD34 + and alpha 6-integrin or CD34 +/CD49f +) in the isolated keratinocytes were determined by flow cytometric analysis. Both single and chronic UVR treatments (1. 8 kJ/m (2)) resulted in an increase in the frequency of double positive HSCs in PKC epsilon TG mice as compared to their WT littermates. To determine the rate of proliferation of bulge region stem cells, a 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine labeling (BrdU) experiment was performed. In the WT mice, the percent of double positive HSCs retaining BrdU label was 28. 4 +-0. 6% compared to 4. 0 +-0. 06% for the TG mice, an approximately 7-fold decrease. A comparison of gene expression profiles of FACS sorted double positive HSCs showed increased expression of Pes1, Rad21, Tfdp1 and Cks1b genes in TG mice compared to WT mice. Also, PKC epsilon over expression in mice increased the clonogenicity of isolated keratinocytes, a property commonly ascribed to stem cells.",

Cancer chemotherapy is associated with serious side effects, including temporary hair loss and impairment of pigmentation. We suspect that ectopic melanin deposition occurring due to chemotherapy may add to these effects worsening the already unpleasant symptoms. We associated the ectopic occurrence of follicular melanin after chemotherapy with splenic melanosis-an interesting example of extradermal melanin localization-and we expected an increase in splenic melanin deposition after chemotherapy. Using the C57BL/6 murine model of synchronized hair cycle induced by depilation, we visualized splenic melanin by means of several histological and histochemical protocols of staining: hematoxylin and eosin, May-Grunwald-Giemsa and Fontana-Masson. Unexpectedly, the splenic deposition of melanin decreased due to application of cyclophosphamide (i. p. 120 mg/kg body weight on day 9 post depilation). The drop was abrupt and lasted for at least 5 days (day 13-18 post depilation), as compared with normal hair cycle. Moreover, in mice with normal, depilation-induced hair cycle we observed a similar drop shortly before entering catagen (day 15 post depilation), followed by a slow and partial increase in splenic melanization up to day 27 post depilation in both groups. We conclude that cyclophosphamide negatively affects splenic melanization and/or extradermal transfer of ectopic melanin from the dystrophic hair follicles, but the most powerful down-regulator of splenic melanosis is normal and dystrophic catagen-the phase of hair follicle involution and re-modelling.",

It is known that baldness caused by androgenetic alopecia is involved with androgen and the androgen receptor. Furthermore, it has been reported that testosterone secretion follows a circadian rhythm. Therefore, we hypothesized that a relationship exists between androgen-induced alopecia and biological rhythm. The mammalian circadian rhythm is controlled by several clock genes. Brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein-1 (BMAL1), one of the clock genes, is a transcription factor that plays central roles in the regulation of circadian rhythms. In this study, we investigated the influence of BMAL1 on hair follicle functions and hair growth. Mice deficient in BMAL1 expression exhibited a delay in hair regrowth after shaving. In hair follicles of mouse vibrissa, expression of Bmal1 and other clock genes was found to be rhythmic. Knockdown of BMAL1 in human follicle dermal papilla cells resulted in modulation of expression of several hair growth-related genes.

The hair follicle (HF) is a continuously remodeled mini organ that cycles between growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen). As the anagen-to-catagen transformation of microdissected human scalp HFs can be observed in organ culture, it permits the study of the unknown controls of autonomous, rhythmic tissue remodeling of the HF, which intersects developmental, chronobiological, and growth-regulatory mechanisms. The hypothesis that the peripheral clock system is involved in hair cycle control, i. e., the anagen-to-catagen transformation, was tested. Here we show that in the absence of central clock influences, isolated, organ-cultured human HFs show circadian changes in the gene and protein expression of core clock genes (CLOCK, BMAL1, and Period1) and clock-controlled genes (c-Myc, NR1D1, and CDKN1A), with Period1 expression being hair cycle dependent. Knockdown of either BMAL1 or Period1 in human anagen HFs significantly prolonged anagen. This provides evidence that peripheral core clock genes modulate human HF cycling and are an integral component of the human hair cycle clock. Specifically, our study identifies BMAL1 and Period1 as potential therapeutic targets for modulating human hair growth.",

BACKGROUND: Blond and white hair removal by laser is a complicated task with weak satisfactory results due to the deficiency in laser-absorbing chromophore. OBJECTIVE: To investigate if repetitive sessions of photodynamic therapy (PDT) using external application of liposomal Rose bengal (RB) photosensitizer followed by intense pulsed light (IPL) exposure enables removal of gray and white hair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rose bengal loaded in liposomes (LRB) was constructed, prepared in hydrogel, and was studied for some pharmaceutical properties. Penetration and selective hair follicle damage in mice skin were studied. Topical gel containing LRB was used for treating fifteen adult females who were complaining of facial white terminal hair. Unwanted facial hair was treated for three sessions at intervals of 4-6 weeks using intense pulsed light (IPL). At each session, the treatment area was pre-treated with topical LRB gel, while a control group of another 15 patients applied placebo gel before IPL treatment. Evaluations included hair regrowth, which was measured 4 weeks after each treatment session and at 6 months follow-up by counting the number of terminal hair compared with baseline pretreatment values. Treatment outcomes and complications if any were also reported. RESULTS: Average hair regrowth in the LRB group was 56% after 3 treatment cycles. After six-months follow up, average terminal hair count compared with baseline pretreatment showed 40% reduction and no recorded side effects. A significant difference (P < 0. 05) was seen compared with the control group ; the clinical results were promising.

Although numerous lasers with different wavelengths are available for laser hair removal, their use in individuals with dark-pigmented skin remains a challenge. The present study aims to develop a numerical heat diffusion model considering skin types over various wavelengths. This numerical mode uses Pennes approximation to represent heat from metabolism, blood perfusion and an external heating source. The heat diffusion model is experimentally validated by using agar-based skin tissue phantoms. Diode lasers with four different wavelengths were used with two antithetical skin models. The pulse width and beam spot size were set to 200 ms and 1 cm (2), respectively. Temperature distribution along the hair structure and skin tissue was examined to determine both thermal confinement and heat transfer to the hair follicle. Experimental results are well matched with the numerical results. The results show that for the light skin model, thermal confinement is well achieved over various wavelengths, and treatment efficacy is expected to be better at a shorter wavelength. Otherwise, for the dark skin model, thermal confinement is poorly achieved as the wavelength decreases (< 808 nm) and the temperature gap between the hair tip and the hair root is significantly large compared with the light skin model, which may lead to adverse effects. We believe that the developed numerical model will help to establish optimal laser parameters for different individuals during laser hair removal.",

Polymeric NPs were evaluated in terms of particle shape, size, zeta potential, suspension stability, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release. Lyophilized NPs were incorporated into the PLO and rheological measurements of the nanoparticles-embedded organogels were done. The fate of the NPs in the skin was traced by incorporation of a fluorescent dye into the NPs. As a result, ROX was efficiently incorporated into polymeric NPs characterized by the appropriate size (approximately 300 nm) allowing drug delivery to hair follicles. In ex vivo human skin penetration studies, horizontal skin sections revealed fluorescence deep in the hair follicles. Although the organogel has higher affinity to the lipidic follicular area than an aqueous suspension of NPs, it did not seem to improve penetration of the NPs along the hair shaft.

With wide adoption of explosive-dependent weaponry during military activities, Blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT)-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a significant medical issue. Therefore, a robust and accessible biomarker system is in demand for effective and efficient TBI diagnosis. Such systems will also be beneficial to studies of TBI pathology. Here we propose the mammalian hair follicles as a potential candidate. An Advanced Blast Simulator (ABS) was developed to generate shock waves simulating traumatic conditions on brains of rat model. Microarray analysis was performed in hair follicles to identify the gene expression profiles that are associated with shock waves. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and sub-network enrichment analysis (SNEA) were used to identify cell processes and molecular signaling cascades affected by simulated bomb blasts. Enrichment analyses indicated that genes with altered expression levels were involved in central nervous system (CNS)/peripheral nervous system (PNS) responses as well as signal transduction including Ca2 +, K +-transportation-dependent signaling, Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) signaling and Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. Many of the pathways identified as affected by shock waves in the hair follicles have been previously reported to be TBI responsive in other organs such as brain and blood. The results suggest that the hair follicle has some common TBI responsive molecular signatures to other tissues. Moreover, various TBI-associated diseases were identified as preferentially affected using a gene network approach, indicating that the hair follicle may be capable of reflecting comprehensive responses to TBI conditions. Accordingly, the present study demonstrates that the hair follicle is a potentially viable system for rapid and non-invasive TBI diagnosis.",

ANIMALS: Seven dogs of different ages, breeds and genders with a clinical and histopathological diagnosis of noninflammatory alopecia. METHODS: Each dog was treated twice weekly for a maximum of 2 months with a therapeutic laser producing the following three different wavelengths emerging simultaneously from 21 foci: 13 x 16 mW, 470 nm ; 4 x 50 mW, 685 nm ; and 4 x 200 mW, 830 nm. The fluence given was 3 J/cm (2), frequency 5 Hz, amplitude of the irradiated area was 25 cm (2) and application time was 1. 34 min.

From one dog, post-treatment biopsies of treated and untreated sites were obtained for histological evaluation of hair density and the percentage of haired and nonhaired follicles. RESULTS: At the end of the study, coat regrowth was greatly improved in six of seven animals and improved in one of seven. By morphometry, the area occupied by hair follicles was 18% in the treated sample and 11% in the untreated one (11%) ; haired follicles were (per area) 93% in the treated sample and only 9% in the control sample.

BACKGROUND: Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is a lymphocyte-mediated cicatricial alopecia mostly involving the bulge region of the hair follicle. The origin of LPP is unknown. Therapy for LPP often does not prevent disease progression. We describe histologic and immunohistologic features that aid in diagnosis and provide an explanation for disease progression in LPP. OBJECTIVE: We sought to demonstrate a decrease in the number of catagen-/telogen-phase follicles and to confirm the loss of cytokeratin 15 (CK15) expression in the stem cells of LPP-affected follicles. METHODS: In all, 144 LPP cases were retrieved ; 55 cases were stained immunohistochemically, targeting the CK15 antigen with 40 cases ultimately analyzed for CK15 expression. RESULTS: Catagen/telogen phase was significantly decreased or absent in all cases of LPP, a novel clue useful in histologic diagnostics. The loss of CK15 + stem cells in most affected follicles in LPP was also confirmed, with unaffected follicles retaining CK15 + stem cells. LIMITATIONS: Limited tissue for analysis remained in the clinical sample tissue blocks. CONCLUSION: Damaged follicles that have lost their CK15 + stem cells disappear when they enter catagen phase. CK15 + stem cell loss explains the clinical observation that LPP progresses despite immunosuppressive therapies. Finally, the absence of catagen/telogen hair follicles is a helpful diagnostic clue for LPP.",

Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) exerts positive therapeutic effects on hair thickness and density in patients with pattern hair loss. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intra-perifollicular autologous PRP and polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) injections in treating female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Twenty FPHL patients were treated with a single session of PRP injection, followed by 12 sessions of PDRN intra-perifollicular injection, along the scalp at weekly intervals. Additionally, another 20 FPHL patients were treated with 12 sessions of PDRN injection only. Meanwhile, one half of the backs of two rabbits was injected with the PRP preparation, while the other half was injected with phosphate buffered saline as a control. Tissue samples from the rabbits were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Compared with baseline values, patients treated with PRP and PDRN injections exhibited clinical improvement in mean hair counts (23. 2 +-15. 5% ; p < 0. 001) and mean hair thickness (16. 8 +-10. 8% ; p < 0. 001). In addition, patients treated with the 12 sessions of intra-perifollicular PDRN injection alone also showed clinical improvement in mean hair counts (17. 9 +-13. 2% ; p < 0. 001) and mean hair thickness (13. 5 +-10. 7% ; p < 0. 001). Comparison analyses between the two groups revealed that combined therapy with PRP and PDRN induces greater improvement in hair thickness than treatment with PDRN therapy alone (p = 0. 031), but not in hair counts (p > 0. 05). The pilot animal study revealed significant up-regulation of WNT, platelet-derived growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor expression in rabbit skin treated with the PRP preparation, compared with control skin. In conclusion, intra-perifollicular injections of autologous PRP and/or PDRN generate improvements in hair thickness and density in FPHL patients.",

Spermidine (Spd), the prototypic polyamine, has been shown to be essential for hair follicle (HF) growth. However, Spd can be readily converted into other polyamines, and is physiologically unstable. Therefore, to assess its individual functions on HFs, we used the metabolically stable Spd analog N (1)-methylspermidine (N (1)-MeSpd). N (1)-MeSpd was confirmed to be a metabolically stable compound, with a half life of 90 h. 0. 5 microM N (1)-MeSpd strongly prolonged anagen and decreased cell apoptosis in HFs in culture after 6 days, accompanied by specific stimulation of the expression of the epithelial stem cell-associated keratin, K15. N (1)-MeSpd also reduced lactate dehydrogenase activity in the culture supernatant, a parameter of cell death and cell lysis. N (1)-MeSpd diminished intracellular reactive oxygen species production in cultured keratinocytes, and reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 gene and protein expression after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. This suggests that some effects of N (1)-MeSpd may be mediated by anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. These additional properties of N (1)-MeSpd could be clinically important for the treatment of inflammatory alopecias and inflammatory scalp diseases.",

Hispidin, a metabolite of 5, 6-dehydrokawain from alpinia, inhibited the growth of cancer cells with the IC50 of 25 muM as does artepillin C, the major anti-cancer ingredient in Brazilian green propolis. Mimosine tetrapeptides (MFWY, MFYY, and MFFY) and hispidin derivatives (H1-3) also exhibited a strong anti-cancer activity with the IC50 ranging from 16 to 30 muM.

UNLABELLED: Alopecia areata is a common disorder in which autoimmune destruction of hair follicles results in patchy hair loss. Currently there is no adequate therapy, although immune modulator therapies are currently in development. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a hair cycle stimulator which shows promise in treating various forms of alopecia, although its short half-life limits its clinical use. PTH-CBD is a PTH analog which binds collagen, prolonging retention in skin. We tested effects of PTH-CBD in C3H/HeJ-engrafted mice, the animal model for alopecia areata, on hair growth and found that a significant proportion of animals had reduced hair loss (PTH-CBD: 13/21, 62% vs. CONTROL: 3/10, 30% ; P < 0. 01). Histological analysis showed no change in immune response, but there was increased number of anagen hair follicles and increased production of beta-catenin, a factor which initiates the anagen phase of the hair cycle. PTH-CBD thus shows promise as a therapy for alopecia areata, either alone or in conjunction with immune modulation therapy.",

Several clinical research studies have demonstrated that chronic cutaneous wounds can be treated with hair follicle grafts. However, the clinical outcomes of hair follicle grafting compared to split-thickness skin grafting have not been examined. This study sought to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with chronic wounds following hair follicle therapy and split-thickness skin graft therapy in a relatively large cohort of patients. Forty patients were enrolled in the study, a retrospective analysis of all patients underwent therapy with hair follicles (cohort A) and split-thickness skin grafts (cohort B) was performed. Safety, healing duration, skin quality (recipient site), scar formation (donor site) and overall postoperative outcome were analyzed. The wound sites were examined using photography at weeks 2, 8, and 12 after surgery. Five non-biased reviewers estimated the above-mentioned clinical outcomes using a five-point Likert scale. The ages and wound areas were similar between cohorts A (n = 20) and B (n = 20). Total wound closure was observed and adverse events were rare and controllable in both cohorts. The skin and scar quality were rated significantly higher in the hair follicle cohort than the split-thickness skin graft cohort (4. 40 vs 3. 45, P < 0. 05 and 4. 65 vs 3. 20, P < 0. 05 ; respectively). Hair follicle therapy resulted in a significantly higher overall score than split-thickness skin graft treatment (4. 45 vs 3. 40, P < 0. 05). This study demonstrated that hair follicles can achieve better skin/scar quality and overall clinical outcomes than split-thickness skin grafts. Hair follicles should be considered an effective surgical technique for the treatment of chronic cutaneous wounds.",

    "text": "Forearm hair density and risk of keratinocyte cancers in Australian adults. Evidence suggests that progenitor cells of keratinocyte cancers (basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)) may originate from epidermal stem cells including hair follicle stem cells. We hypothesised that, therefore, a relatively higher density of hair follicles on human skin may increase keratinocyte cancer risk. To evaluate this, we assessed density of mid-forearm hair in Australian adults who were randomly selected participants in a community-based cohort study of skin cancer. Hair density was assessed clinically against a set of four standard photographs showing grades of hair density, and incidence data on histologically confirmed BCC and SCC across a 20-year period were collected. Incidence rate ratios were calculated for categories of forearm hair density using multivariable regression analysis with adjustment for age, sex, phenotypic characteristics and markers of chronic sun exposure. Among the 715 participants (43% male, average age 61 years), 237 developed at least one BCC and 115 persons developed at least one SCC. Participants with dense forearm hair (n = 169, all male) had a higher incidence of BCC (IRR = 2. 24, 95% CI 1. 20, 4. 18, P = 0. 01) and SCC (IRR = 2. 80, 95% CI 1. 20, 6. 57, P = 0. 02) compared to individuals with sparse forearm hair after multivariable adjustment. Stratified analyses showed that among men, those with dense versus sparse hair developed SCC more commonly (IRR = 3. 01, 95% CI 1. 03, 8. 78, P = 0. 04). Women with moderate versus sparse hair density were more likely affected by BCC (IRR = 2. 29, 95% CI 1. 05, 5. 00, P = 0. 038). Thus, our study suggests that in both men and women, a higher density of body hair may be associated with increased BCC and SCC risk.",

In the present study, a dual-label nanocarrier system was implemented in which FITC-labeled BSA hydrogel nanocarriers loaded with the model drug and dye TRITC-dextran were applied topically to porcine ear skin. Follicular penetration and the distribution of both dyes corresponding to the nanocarriers and the model drug in the follicular ducts subsequent to administration to the skin were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The release of TRITC-dextran from the particles was induced by washing of the nanocarriers, which were kept in a buffer containing TRITC-labeled dextran to balance out the diffusion of the dextran during storage, thereby changing the concentration gradient. The results showed a slightly but statistically significantly deeper follicular penetration of fluorescent signals corresponding to TRITC-dextran as opposed to fluorescence corresponding to the FITC-labeled particles. The different localizations of the dyes in the cross-sections of the skin samples evidenced the release of the model drug from the labeled nanoparticles.",

BACKGROUND: Folliculotropism in melanoma is poorly characterized and standard categorization for follicular involvement by melanoma is unavailable. We propose a logical categorization system. METHODS: We conducted a search of our archives over a 24-year period for cases mentioning the terms follicle, follicular, folliculotropic, folliculocentric and melanoma. RESULTS: We identified 90 cases of melanoma with involvement of the hair follicle. Distinct patterns were identified. The invasive patterns were primary follicular, folliculotropic and invasive arising from melanoma in situ (MIS) with extensive follicular involvement. Follicular involvement by MIS was either lentiginous, nested or a combination of both. A total of 29 invasive melanomas were identified. Of these 12 had invasive melanoma around the hair follicle, 2 were primary follicular melanomas, 7 showed folliculotropism and 3 were invasive melanomas arising from MIS around the follicle. Seventeen invasive melanomas had follicles only involved by MIS (9 nested, 6 nested and lentiginous and 2 lentiginous). A total of 61 cases of MIS with follicular involvement were identified ; of these 33 were lentiginous, 10 nested and 18 both lentiginous and nested. CONCLUSION: We propose that the three distinct patterns of follicular involvement by invasive melanoma and the three distinct patterns of MIS will be valuable for logically categorizing involvement of the hair follicle by melanoma.",

BACKGROUND: Many COL4A5 splice region variants have been described in patients with X-linked Alport syndrome, but few have been confirmed by functional analysis to actually cause defective splicing. We sought to demonstrate that a novel COL4A5 splice region variant in a family with Alport syndrome is pathogenic using functional studies. We also describe an alternative method of diagnosis. METHODS: Targeted next-generation sequencing results of an individual with Alport syndrome were analyzed and the results confirmed by Sanger sequencing in family members. A splicing reporter minigene assay was used to examine the variant ' s effect on splicing in transfected cells. Plucked hair follicles from patients and controls were examined for collagen IV proteins using immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: A novel splice region mutation in COL4A5, c. 1780-6T > G, was identified and segregated with disease in this family. This variant caused frequent skipping of exon 25, resulting in a frameshift and truncation of collagen alpha5 (IV) protein. We also developed and validated a new approach to characterize the expression of collagen alpha5 (IV) protein in the basement membranes of plucked hair follicles. Using this approach we demonstrated reduced collagen alpha5 (IV) protein in affected male and female individuals in this family, supporting frequent failure of normal splicing. CONCLUSIONS: Differing normal to abnormal transcript ratios in affected individuals carrying splice region variants may contribute to variable disease severity observed in Alport families. Examination of plucked hair follicles in suspected X-linked Alport syndrome patients may offer a less invasive alternative method of diagnosis and serve as a pathogenicity test for COL4A5 variants of uncertain significance.",

BACKGROUND: Geranium sibiricum L. has been used as a medicinal plant to treat diarrhea, bacterial infection, and cancer in Bulgaria, Peru, and Korea. However, its hair growth-promoting effect was not investigated so far. This study examined the effects of Geranium sibiricum L. extract (GSE) on hair growth, using in vitro and in vivo models. METHODS: Antioxidant, proliferation and migration assay of GSE was performed with human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs). Hair-growth promoting effect was measured in animal model. Relative expression of interleukin-1, vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta 1 was determined by real time RT-PCR. Expression of Ki-67 and stem cell factor were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: GSE treatment proliferated and migrated human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) more than treatment of 10 muM minoxidil. GSE significantly stimulated the expression of Ki-67 protein and the mRNA levels of hepatocyte growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor in hDPCs. Topical application of 1, 000 ppm GSE for 3 weeks promoted more significant hair growth on shaved C57BL/6 mice than did 5% minoxidil. The histological morphology of hair follicles demonstrated an active anagen phase with the induction of stem cell factor. GSE treatment significantly reduced the number of mast cells and the expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 in mouse skin tissues. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that GSE promotes hair growth in vitro and in vivo by regulating growth factors and the cellular response.",

Alopecia areata (AA), a chronic, relapsing, hair-loss disorder, is considered to be a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. It affects approximately 1. 7% of the population, but its precise pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Despite the recent attention focused on the roles of inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases, little is known about inflammasome activation in AA. Thus, in this study, we investigated the pattern of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the outer root sheath (ORS) cells of hair follicles. We found that interleukin (IL)-1beta and caspase-1 expression was increased in hair follicle remnants and inflammatory cells of AA tissue specimens. After stimulation of ORS cells with the double-stranded (ds) RNA mimic polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly [I: C]), the activation of caspase-1 and secretion of IL-1beta were enhanced. Moreover, NLRP3 knockdown decreased this poly (I: C)-induced IL-1beta production. Finally, we found that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) translocated from the nucleus to the cytosol and was secreted into the extracellular space by inflammasome activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that ORS cells are important immunocompetent cells that induce NLRP3 inflammasomes. In addition, dsRNA-induced IL-1beta and HMGB1 secretion from ORS cells may contribute to clarifying the pathogenesis and therapeutic targets of AA.",

Little is known about the energetics of growing hair follicles, particularly in the mitochondrially abundant bulb. Here, mitochondrial and oxidative metabolism was visualized by multiphoton and light sheet microscopy in cultured bovine hair follicles and plucked human hairs. Mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi), cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and secretory granules were assessed with parameter-indicating fluorophores. In growing follicles, lower bulb epithelial cells had high viability, and mitochondria were polarized. Most epithelially generated ROS co-localized with polarized mitochondria. As the imaging plane captured more central and distal cells, DeltaPsi disappeared abruptly at a transition to a nonfluorescent core continuous with the hair shaft. Approaching the transition, DeltaPsi and ROS increased, and secretory granules disappeared. ROS and DeltaPsi were strongest in a circumferential paraxial ring at putative sites for formation of the outer cortex/cuticle of the hair shaft. By contrast, polarized mitochondria in dermal papillar fibroblasts produced minimal ROS. Plucked hairs showed a similar abrupt transition of degranulation/depolarization near sites of keratin deposition, as well as an ROS-generating paraxial ring of fire. Hair movement out of the follicle appeared to occur independently of follicular bulb bioenergetics by a tractor mechanism involving the inner and outer root sheaths.",

BACKGROUND: The scar that occurs after cleft lip surgery poses a serious cosmetic problem. One of the methods used to solve this problem in adult male patients is hair transplantation. However, satisfactory results with this method cannot always be achieved because of possible graft loss. The corrective feature of fat grafting has been reported in many studies. The authors ' aim with this report is to share their results with hair transplantation combined with fat grafting in patients with cleft lip. METHODS: This study included 20 patients who had both a scar and alopecia in the cleft lip area. The patients underwent fat grafting from the periumbilical region by means of miniature liposuction harvesting cannulas. Three months after fat injection, hair transplantation was performed with hair from the submental area and scalp using the folliculate unit extraction technique. Patients were followed for 12 months. Survival rate of transplanted hair and patient satisfaction were analyzed after the procedures. RESULTS: After this camouflaging technique with fat grafting and hair transplantation, the scar was hidden quite well. The graft survival rate was also better compared with results from similar studies. Patient and observer satisfaction results with the scar tissue were significantly improved, which was confirmed statistically. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that this combined camouflaging technique is a very effective treatment in male patients with cleft lip who have serious secondary upper lip scars. The authors present a series of patients treated with this technique, which resulted in a high level of patient satisfaction. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of focal atrichia in various types of hair loss and its histologic characteristics in female pattern hair loss. METHODS: Part 1 of the study was a review of 250 consecutive female patients seen with hair loss for the presence of focal atrichia, and part 2 examined paired biopsy specimens from haired areas versus those from areas with focal atrichia in 18 subjects with female pattern hair loss. RESULTS: Focal atrichia was seen in 46 of 104 of women with female pattern hair loss (44%), including 67% of those with the late-onset subtype versus 15% of those with the early-onset subtype, compared with in 3 of 146 of those with other hair disorders (2%). Biopsy findings of focal atrichia in female pattern hair loss showed primarily a more progressive miniaturization process than that of haired areas of the scalp.

Recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 10 (rhFGF-10) is frequently used to treat patients with skin injuries. It can also promote hair growth. However, the effective application of rhFGF-10 is limited because of its poor stability and transdermal absorption. In this study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blotting were used to identify transgenic safflowers carrying a gene encoding an oleosin-rhFGF-10 fusion protein. The size and structural integrity of oleosin-rhFGF-10 in oil bodies extracted from transgenic safflower seeds was characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting. Oil body extracts containing oleosin-rhFGF-10 were topically applied to mouse skin. The absorption of oleosin-rhFGF-10 was studied by immunohistochemistry. Its efficiency in promoting wound healing and hair regeneration were evaluated in full thickness wounds and hair growth assays. We identified a safflower line that carried the transgene and expressed a 45 kDa oleosin-rhFGF-10 protein. Oil body-bound oleosin-rhFGF-10 was absorbed by the skin with higher efficiency and speed compared with prokaryotically-expressed rhFGF-10. Oleosin-rhFGF-10 also enhanced wound closure and promoted hair growth better than rhFGF-10. The application of oleosin-rhFGF-10 in oil bodies promoted its delivery through the skin, providing a basis for improved therapeutic effects in enhancing wound healing and hair growth.",

While demonstrating efficacy, phenylephrine has several drawbacks when applied to the scalp, including the possibility cardiovascular events. We hypothesized that a high concentration of a weak alpha1 agonist would allow for: (a) rapid penetration through the stratum corneum eliciting a quick response ; (b) a low probability of cardiac adverse events owing to the low receptor binding affinity ; and (c) an efficacy of the weak alpha1 agonist similar to that of phenylephrine at the local site of application. Accordingly, we developed a novel topical solution, AB-102, containing a high concentration of a weak alpha1 agonist. Several studies were conducted to test the safety and efficacy of AB-102. In a dose escalating safety study, utilizing a wearable holter monitor, we observed no cardiac or hemodynamic adverse events.

Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), also known as anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, is characterized by the clinical manifestations of less sweat or no sweat, sparse or no hair, tooth agenesis and/or abnormal tooth morphology. The characteristics of alpaca ear hair differ from the back hair. The ectodysplasin A (EDA) signaling pathway has a regulatory effect on skin development and hair growth. The aim of the present study was to study the effects of EDA on alpaca hair growth by examining the mRNA and protein expression levels of EDA in alpaca ear and back skin by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Results indicated that EDA expression was higher in the ear skin compared with the back skin. The expression levels of let-7b in the skin of healthy alpacas varies ; the difference between let-7b expression levels of the ear and back have been reported to be > 2-fold, suggesting a role for let-7b in the development of adult alpaca skin and hair follicles. A dual-luciferase reporter vector was constructed to verify the targeting relationship between microRNA let-7b and EDA, and the results revealed that EDA was a target gene of let-7b. Alpaca skin fibroblasts were transfected with a let-7b eukaryotic expression vector to investigate the regulatory relationship between let-7b and EDA. The expression of EDA was decreased in the transfected group ; immunocytochemical results demonstrated that the EDA protein was abundantly expressed in the fibroblast cytoplasm. EDA protein expression was weaker in the transfected cells than in the untransfected cells. These results suggested that EDA may serve a role in alpaca hair growth and is probably a target gene of let-7b ; let-7b downregulated EDA mRNA and protein expressions, which suggested that let-7b may regulate alpaca hair growth.

This interesting phenomenon is termed as wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN). We hypothesized that M2 macrophages are crucially involved in WIHN. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the contribution of M2 macrophages to WIHN. METHOD: We established a mouse model of WIHN. A full thickness skin excision was implemented on the back of C57BL/6 (B6) mice. Newly developing hair follicles were detected by a whole-mount assay. WIHN took place 2 weeks after wounding. RESULTS: At first, flow cytometry revealed increased infiltration of CD11b +/CD206 + M2 macrophages at the 2nd and 3rd week after wounding. Immunohistochemistry also showed the existence of CD206 + M2 macrophages in the vicinity of regenerated hair follicles. Secondly, the productions of growth factors were confirmed by culturing M2 macrophages isolated from the skin in a comparison with CD11b + spleen cells. Array for 84 genes revealed increased expressions of various growth factors including Igf1 and Fgf2. Thirdly, we verified the effect of the growth factors on WIHN. WIHN was increased by 2 folds in mice treated with Fgf2 (p = 0. 05) or by 1. 5 folds with Igf1 (p = 0. 05). Finally, we used B6. Tg (ITGAM-DTR) mice in which macrophages are ablated by diphtheria toxin. We depleted macrophages at one to 2 weeks after wounding when M2 macrophages were dominant.

PATIENTS/METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 65 male patients with androgenetic alopecia who underwent follicular unit transplantation. Before the donor strip harvesting procedure, we counted the follicular unit density and calculated the percentage of each follicular unit. And then, we compared them to actual harvesting grafts. RESULT: The number of actual harvested transplanted hairs (3162. 22 +-958. 30) were less than estimated transplanted hairs (3319. 25 +-1007. 86). Both the number and percentage of actual harvested 1-hair follicular unit were more than estimated 1-hair follicular unit. In contrast, the number and percentage of actual harvested 3-hair follicular unit was less than estimated 3-hair follicular unit. The follicular unit density was lower in older patients. Those received more than one session of hair transplantation tended to have lower follicular and hair density (P = 0. 007 and 0. 01, respectively). The scalp laxity was lower in older patients and those received multiple sessions of hair transplantation. CONCLUSION: The actual harvested grafts yield more 1-hair follicular units and less 3-hair follicular units than estimation.

Several enzymes exhibit retinol dehydrogenase activities in vitro ; however, their physiological relevance for retinoic acid biosynthesis in vivo remains unclear. Here, we present evidence that two murine epidermal retinol dehydrogenases, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 16C member 5 (SDR16C5) and SDR16C6, contribute to retinoic acid biosynthesis in living cells and are also essential for the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde in vivo Mice with targeted knockout of the more catalytically active SDR16C6 enzyme have no obvious phenotype, possibly due to functional redundancy, because Sdr16c5 and Sdr16c6 exhibit an overlapping expression pattern during later developmental stages and in adulthood. Mice that lack both enzymes are viable and fertile but display accelerated hair growth after shaving and also enlarged meibomian glands, consistent with a nearly 80% reduction in the retinol dehydrogenase activities of skin membrane fractions from the Sdr16c5/Sdr16c6 double-knockout mice. The up-regulation of hair-follicle stem cell genes is consistent with reduced retinoic acid signaling in the skin of the double-knockout mice.

Hair regeneration has long captured researchers ' attention because alopecia is a common condition and current therapeutic approaches have significant limitations. Dermal papilla (DP) cells serve as a signaling center in hair follicles and regulate hair formation and cycling by paracrine secretion. Secreted EVs are important signaling mediators for intercellular communication, and DP-derived extracellular vesicles (DP-EVs) may play an important role in hair regeneration. However, the instability of EVs in vivo and their low long-term retention after transplantation hinder their use in clinical applications. Methods: Human DP-EVs were encapsulated in partially oxidized sodium alginate (OSA) hydrogels, yielding OSA-encapsulated EVs (OSA-EVs), which act as a sustained-release system to increase the potential therapeutic effect of DP-EVs. The ability of the OSA-EVs to protect protein was assessed. The hair regeneration capacity of OSA-EVs, as well as the underlying mechanism, was explored in hair organ culture and a mouse model of depilation. Results: The OSA-EVs were approximately 100 mum in diameter, and as the hydrogel degraded, DP-EVs were gradually released. In addition, the hydrogel markedly increased the stability of vesicular proteins and increased the retention of EVs in vitro and in vivo. The OSA-EVs significantly facilitated proliferation of hair matrix cells, prolonged anagen phase in cultured human hairs, and accelerated the regrowth of back hair in mice after depilation. These effects may be due to upregulation of hair growth-promoting signaling molecules such as Wnt3a and beta-catenin, and downregulation of inhibitory molecule BMP2. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that OSA hydrogels promote the therapeutic effects of DP-EVs, and indicate that our novel OSA-EVs could be used to treat alopecia.",

Dermal papilla (DP) cells are the ultimate reservoir of cells with the potential of hair regeneration in hair loss patients. Here, we analyzed the role of macrophage-derived Wnts (3a and 7b) and macrophage extracellular vesicles (MAC-EVs) in promoting hair growth. We studied the proliferation, migration, and expression of growth factors of human-DP cells in the presence or absence of MAC-EVs. Additionally, we tested the effect of MAC-EV treatment on hair growth in a mouse model and human hair follicles. Data from western blot and flow cytometry showed that MAC-EVs were enriched with Wnt3a and Wnt7b, and more than 95% were associated with their membrane. The results suggest that Wnt proteins in MAC-EVs activate the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways, which leads to activation of transcription factors (Axin2 and Lef1). The MAC-EVs significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration, and levels of hair-inductive markers of DP cells. Additionally, MAC-EVs phosphorylated AKT and increased the levels of the survival protein Bcl-2. The DP cells treated with MAC-EVs showed increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). Treatment of Balb/c mice with MAC-EVs promoted hair follicle (HF) growth in vivo and also increased hair shaft size in a short period in human HFs. Our findings suggest that MAC-EV treatment could be clinically used as a promising novel anagen inducer in the treatment of hair loss.",

    "text": "The local hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in cultured human dermal papilla cells. BACKGROUND: Stress is an important cause of skin disease, including hair loss. The hormonal response to stress is due to the HPA axis, which comprises hormones such as corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol. Many reports have shown that CRF, a crucial stress hormone, inhibits hair growth and induces hair loss. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of CRF on human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) as well as hair follicles and to investigate whether the HPA axis was established in cultured human DPCs. RESULTS: CRF inhibited hair shaft elongation and induced early catagen transition in human hair follicles. Hair follicle cells, both human DPCs and human ORSCs, expressed CRF and its receptors and responded to CRF. CRF inhibited the proliferation of human DPCs through cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Anagen-related cytokine levels were downregulated in CRF-treated human DPCs. Interestingly, increases in proopiomelanocortin (POMC), ACTH, and cortisol were induced by CRF in human DPCs, and antagonists for the CRF receptor blocked the effects of this hormone. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that stress can cause hair loss by acting through stress hormones. Additionally, these results suggested that a fully functional HPA axis exists in human DPCs and that CRF directly affects human DPCs as well as human hair follicles under stress conditions.",

OBJECTIVE: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), a common alopecia, is often accompanied by abnormal expression of multiple miRNAs. This study aims to investigate abnormally expressed miRNAs in patients with AGA and their specific molecular mechanism. METHODS: miRNA microarray profiling and qRT-PCR validation were used to screen and verify abnormally expressed miRNAs in patients with AGA. Human hair follicles (HFs) were treated with different concentrations of dihydrotestosterone (DHT, 10-5, 10-6, 10-7 and 10-8 mol/L) for 10 days. The effects of DHT on HF growth, proliferation, and miRNA expression in cultured HFs were investigated using immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR. Moreover, human dermal papilla cells (HDPCs) were treated/transfected with a Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activator and/or miR-133b mimic, and then the CCK-8 assay was used to evaluate HDPC proliferation. qRT-PCR and Western blotting were used to measure the expression of Versican, ALP and beta-catenin RESULTS: miRNA microarray profiling identified 43 miRNAs that were significantly differentially expressed in AGA patients, and qRT-PCR verified that 8 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed. The expression of miR-133b was abnormally high in AGA patients. DHT (10-5 mol/L) inhibited human HF growth and upregulated miR-133b expression, and DHT (10-7 mol/L) induced human HF growth and downregulated miR-133b expression. HDPC proliferation was inhibited, and the expression of beta-catenin was downregulated in the miR-133b mimic-transfected group compared with the control group (P < 0. 05). Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activator treatment significantly promoted HDPC proliferation and upregulated the expression of beta-catenin (P < 0. 05). In addition, the proliferation of HDPCs was not significantly different between the group cotreated with a Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activator and miR-133b mimic, and the control group (P > 0. 05), but the expression of Versican and ALP was suppressed in the cotreatment group (P < 0. 05) CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that patients with androgenic alopecia have specific miRNA expression profiles and that the abnormal expression of miR-133b may inactivate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and ultimately regulate hair growth.",

Human skin and hair follicles are recognized sites of microbial colonization. These microbiota help regulate host immune mechanisms via an interplay between microbes and immune cells, influencing homeostasis and inflammation. Bacteria affect immune responses by controlling the local inflammatory milieu, the breakdown of which can result in chronic inflammatory disorders. Follicular microbiome shifts described in some inflammatory cutaneous diseases suggest a link between their development or perpetuation and dysbiosis. Though the hair follicle infundibulum is an area of intense immunological interactions, bulb and bulge regions represent immune-privileged niches. Immune privilege maintenance seems essential for hair growth and regeneration, as collapse and inflammation characterize inflammatory hair disorders like alopecia areata and primary cicatricial alopecia. Current research largely focuses on immunological aberrations. However, studies suggest that external stimuli and interactions across the follicular epithelium can have profound effects on the local immune system, homeostasis, and cycling. Herein, we review hair follicle bacterial colonization, its possible effects on the underlying tissue, and links to the pathogenesis of alopecia, beyond the pure investigation of specific species abundance.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophilic folliculitis is an inflammatory condition of hair follicles. In some neutrophilic folliculitis, such as in patients with acne and hidradenitis suppurativa, follicular hyperkeratosis is also observed. Neutrophilic folliculitis is often induced and/or exacerbated by a high-fat diet (HFD). However, the molecular mechanisms by which an HFD affects neutrophilic folliculitis are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to elucidate how an HFD promotes the development of neutrophilic folliculitis. METHODS: Mice were fed an HFD, and their skin was subjected to histologic, RNA sequencing, and imaging mass spectrometry analyses. To examine the effect of an HFD on neutrophil accumulation around the hair follicles, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used as an irritant to the skin. RESULTS: Histologic analysis revealed follicular hyperkeratosis in the skin of HFD-fed mice. RNA sequencing analysis showed that genes related to keratinization, especially in upper hair follicular keratinocytes, were significantly upregulated in HFD-fed mice. Application of PMA to the skin induced neutrophilic folliculitis in HFD-fed mice but not in mice fed a normal diet. Accumulation of neutrophils in the skin and around hair follicles was dependent on CXCR2 signaling, and CXCL1 (a CXCR2 ligand) was produced mainly by hair follicular keratinocytes. Imaging mass spectrometry analysis revealed an increase in fatty acids in the skin of HFD-fed mice. Application of these fatty acids to the skin induced follicular hyperkeratosis and caused PMA-induced neutrophilic folliculitis even in mice fed a normal diet. CONCLUSION: An HFD can facilitate the development of neutrophilic folliculitis with the induction of hyperkeratosis of hair follicles and increased neutrophil infiltration around the hair follicles via CXCR2 signaling.",

BACKGROUND: Hair follicle undergoes a growth cycle under the regulation of dermal papilla cells. Due to their enormous roles, these fibroblast cells have been used in various in vitro studies as a screening model to evaluate the effect of hair growth regulating agents. OBJECTIVE: In the current study, we aim to check the hair growth potential effect of Argan press cake (APC) extracted using 50 or 80% aqueous ethanol on human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) and to determine the molecular mechanism. METHODS: APC were applied to HFDPCs, then cell proliferation assays, mitochondrial biogenesis assay, and oxidative stress assay were assessed. DNA microarray was performed from the cells treated with our samples and minoxidil. Validation of the results was done using Quantitative Real-Time PCR with primers for hair-growth related genes. GC/MS analysis was used to determine the compounds contained in APC 50 and 80%. RESULTS: APC enhanced cell proliferation along with the stimulation of the ATP content. Additionally, APC had an anti-oxidant activity against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress preventing dermal papilla cell senescence. Consistent with this, global gene profiling analysis showed an activation of hair growth-related pathway, and a downregulation of inflammation-and oxidative stress-related genes by APC extracts. GC/MS analysis revealed that these extracts contained pure fatty acids, derived sugar chains, and pure compounds including tocopherols, squalene, and spinasterol. CONCLUSION: Taken together, here we showed that APC extracts had an effect on stimulating hair growth while inhibiting the inflammation and the oxidative stress of HFDPCs and thus can potentially contribute to an anti-hair loss drug development.",

Background: Inner Mongolian cashmere goats have hair of excellent quality and high economic value, and the skin hair follicle traits of cashmere goats have a direct and important effect on cashmere yield and quality. Circular RNA has been studied in a variety of tissues and cells. Result: In this study, high-throughput sequencing was used to obtain the expression profiles of circular RNA (circRNA) in the hair follicles of Inner Mongolian cashmere goats at different embryonic stages (45, 55, 65, and 75 days). A total of 21, 784 circRNAs were identified. At the same time, the differentially expressed circRNA in the six comparison groups formed in the four stages were: d75vsd45, 59 upregulated and 33 downregulated DE circRNAs ; d75vsd55, 61 upregulated and 102 downregulated DE circRNAs ; d75vsd65, 32 upregulated and 33 downregulated DE circRNAs ; d65vsd55, 67 upregulated and 169 downregulated DE circRNAs ; d65vsd45, 96 upregulated and 63 downregulated DE circRNAs ; and d55vsd45, 76 upregulated and 42 downregulated DE circRNAs. Six DE circRNA were randomly selected to verify the reliability of the sequencing results by quantitative RT-PCR. Subsequently, the circRNA corresponding host genes were analyzed by the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. The results showed that the biological processes related to hair follicle growth and development enriched by GO mainly included hair follicle morphogenesis and cell development, and the signaling pathways related to hair follicle development included the Notch signaling pathway and NF-kappaB signaling pathway. We combined the DE circRNA of d75vsd45 with miRNA and mRNA databases (unpublished) to construct the regulatory network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA, and formed a total of 102 pairs of circRNA-miRNA and 126 pairs of miRNA-mRNA interactions. The binding relationship of circRNA3236-chi-miR-27b-3p and circRNA3236-chi-miR-16b-3p was further verified by dual-luciferase reporter assays, and the results showed that circRNA3236 and chi-miR-27b-3p, and circRNA3236 and chi-miR-16b-3p have a targeted binding relationship. Conclusion: To summarize, we established the expression profiling of circRNA in the fetal skin hair follicles of cashmere goats, and found that the host gene of circRNA may be involved in the development of hair follicles of cashmere goats. The regulatory network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA was constructed and preliminarily verified using DE circRNAs.",

While many studies have focused on SC self-renewal and differentiation, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism regulating SC elimination and compensation upon loss. Here, we report that Caspase-9 deletion in hair follicle SCs (HFSCs) attenuates the apoptotic cascade, resulting in significant temporal delays. Surprisingly, Casp9-deficient HFSCs accumulate high levels of cleaved caspase-3 and are improperly cleared due to an essential caspase-3/caspase-9 feedforward loop. These SCs are retained in an apoptotic-engaged state, serving as mitogenic signaling centers by continuously releasing Wnt3 and instructing proliferation. Investigating the underlying mechanism, we reveal a caspase-3/Dusp8/p38 module responsible for Wnt3 induction, which operates in both normal and Casp9-deleted HFSCs. Notably, Casp9-deleted mice display accelerated wound repair and de novo hair follicle regeneration. Taken together, we demonstrate that apoptotic cells represent a dynamic SC niche, from which emanating signals drive SC proliferation and tissue regeneration.",

We designed cholesterol-and phospholipid-free multilamellar niosomes (MLNs) structured by glyceryl monooleate (GMO) and poloxamer 407 (F127), and evaluated their capacity for transdermal drug delivery. The optimized MLNs had a mean size of 97. 88 +-63. 25 nm and an encapsulation efficiency of 82. 68% +-2. 14%. Notably, the MLNs exhibited a remarkable sustained cargo release. Compared with the tincture, lower transdermal flux but higher skin deposition of aconitine in vitro were achieved in the MLN group (p < 0. 05). We further found that MLNs improved the permeability of the stratum corneum. Additionally, both water-soluble rhodamine B-and liposoluble coumarin 6-labeled MLNs were found to penetrate deeply into the skin through the hair follicles and could be internalized by fibroblasts (CCC-ESF-1). The MLNs possessed greater wettability, and the study focused on delivery to deeper hair follicles and up to the outer hair sheath, which showed advantages for treating diseases of hair follicles, and was potentially superior to the hydrophobic PLGA nanoparticles (diameter: 637. 87 +-22. 77 nm) which mainly accumulated in superficial hair follicles. Hair follicles were therefore demonstrated to be an important way to enhance skin permeability, and MLNs are a promising alternative for topical and transdermal drug delivery.",

However, the number and depth of available literature were far from enough to fully elucidate the prominent role of dWAT in modulating the hair growth cycle.

As the largest subgroup of intermediate filament proteins, keratins are divided into two types of subfamily. Currently, the molecular mechanism of keratins in several animals has been reported but is limited in yak. Here, 53 different kinds of keratins were identified in the yak genome, including 23 type I and 30 type II keratins. Bioinformatics analysis in this study revealed that multiple phosphorylation sites were identified among all the family members. And the subcellular localization of these proteins was predicted to be in the nucleus, cytoskeleton, and cytoplasm. All keratin family proteins were unstable and the scores of instability coefficient were higher than 40. Phylogenetic analysis showed that high consistency results of the sequence conservation and grouping were found in the genomes of yak, sheep, cattle, mouse, rat, and human. Based on the expression patterns obtained from the transcriptome data, keratin genes (KRTs) were grouped into five clusters, and results also showed that KRTs were highly activated in skin tissues during the hair cycle in yak. Among the five clusters, Cluster II contained the most KRTs, which was the main expression pattern of the yak hair follicle cycle, followed by Cluster III. These results indicated the transition period from telogen to anagen and catagen to telogen were highly dynamic in yak. Gene expression correlation analysis showed that KRTs exhibited a strong correlation (mainly positive correlation) throughout the hair follicle development cycle. And the identification of hub KRTs in specific modules related to hair follicle development in this study was performed using the Weight Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA). Specific modules that include KRTs were darkgreen (KRT40), darkgrey (KRT5), turquoise (KRT1, KRT2, KRT10), bisque4 (KRT4), thistle2 (KRT9, KRT39), and yellowgreen (KRT24). The interaction network showed that these genes were found to be related to the regulation of cell cycle, melanogenesis, hair follicle development, keratinocyte proliferation.

Low threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) are important for environmental exploration, social interaction, and tactile discrimination. Whisker hair follicles are mechanical sensory organs in non-primate mammals that are functionally equivalent to human fingertips. Several functional types of LTMRs have been identified in rodent whisker hair follicles, including rapidly adapting (RA), slow adapting type 1 (SA1), and slowly adapting type 2 (SA2) LTMRs. Properties of these LTMRs have not been fully characterized. In the present study, we have used pressure-clamped single-fiber recording technique to record impulses of RA, SA1, and SA2 LTMRs in mouse whisker hair follicles, and tested effects of 5-HT, Cd2 +, tetraethylammonium (TEA), 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and Ba2 + on the LTMR impulses. We show that 5-HT at 2 mM suppresses SA1 impulses but has no effects on RA and SA2 impulses. Cd2 + at 100 muM suppresses both SA1 and SA2 impulses but has no effects on RA impulses. TEA at 10 mM has no effects on RA and SA1 impulses but increased SA2 impulses. However, TEA at 1 mM and 200 muM decreases SA2 impulses. 4-AP at 1 mM suppresses both SA1 and SA2 impulses but has no effects on RA impulses. Ba2 + at 5 mM increases both RA and SA1 impulses but suppresses SA2 impulses.

To examine the effects of EF-2001, we used minoxidil as the positive control.

In the in vivo experiment, the topical application of 200 microL EF-2001 on the dorsal surface of C57BL/6 male mice led to hair growth. Changes in hair regrowth were examined by visual comparison and hematoxylin and eosin staining of skin sections. We also determined the expression levels of marker genes (Wnt) and growth factors (fibroblast growth factor, insulin growth factor 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor) in the skin tissues of the back of each mouse using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

A subpopulation of Yanshan cashmere goats with crimped fibre has emerged in a closed population in recent years, but little is known about differences in cashmere production performance, skin characteristics, and fibre-style-related genes between goats with different cashmere fibre styles. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate fibre characteristics, cashmere yield, hair follicle traits, and fibre-style-related genes in cashmere goats with the two cashmere fleece styles-non-crimped and crimped. Based on the cashmere fibre type, 80 six-month-old female Yanshan cashmere goats were used in this study: 40 goats with non-crimped fleece (NCF) and 40 with crimped fleece (CF). The growth performance and cashmere production of the goats were recorded. Skin samples were collected to determine hair follicle traits and gene sequencing. The results indicated that there were no differences in initial live weight, final live weight, average daily feed intake, and average daily gain between the two groups of goats (P > 0. 05). The total yield of cashmere and the stretched length of fibre of the CF goats were higher (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively) and fibre diameter was lower (P < 0. 05) than that of the NCF goats. There were no between-group differences in the density and activity of primary and secondary hair follicles, secondary-to-primary fibre ratio, depth of primary follicles, or epidermal thickness. However, the depth of secondary follicles and dermal thickness were higher (P < 0. 05) in NCF goats than in CF goats. There were mutations in the KRT5, KAP8, KRT8, KRT74, KRT34, KRT1, KRT71, KRT6A, KAP6, KRT81, and KRT83 genes, four of which caused amino acid changes. The allele and genotype frequencies of base mutations in the KRT5, KAP8, KRT34, KRT1, KRT6A, KRT81, and KRT83 genes were different in the NCF and CF goats (P < 0. 05). The distribution and content of the secondary structure elements and tertiary structures of proteins differed between the wide-type and mutated KRT1 and KRT6A proteins. KRT1, KRT6A, KRT71, and TGFalpha mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in CF goats than in NCF goats (P < 0. 05). It is concluded that cashmere goats that have fleece with crimped fibres produce a greater yield of fleece with finer diameter fibres than those with conventional straight cashmere fibres. These differences in fibre properties may be associated with mutations in the genes coding for KRT1 and KRT6A.",

Here, correlations between marker gene expression in DSC cells and treatment outcomes were assessed to predict therapeutic efficacy. Overall, 32 DSC cell lines were used to evaluate correlations between marker gene expression and treatment outcomes. Correlations between vascular pericyte and preadipocyte marker expression and treatment outcomes were inconsistent. As smooth muscle cell markers, MYOCD correlated negatively with treatment outcomes and SRF consistently demonstrated an inverse correlation. Additionally, CALD1 correlated negatively and ACTA2 correlated inversely with treatment outcomes. DSC cell lines were divided into good and moderate/poor responders to further investigate the correlations. SRF and CALD1 were lower in a good responder compared with a moderate responder. Next, DSC cells were differentiated toward dermal papilla cells. Dermal papilla markers SOX2 and LEF1 before differentiation had moderate positive and inverse correlations with the treatment outcome, respectively.

A series of experimental bioassays has shown that the dermal papilla of the adult rodent vibrissa hair follicle retains unique inductive properties. In view of the many phenotypic and functional differences between specific hair follicle types, and the growing interest in hair follicle biology and disease, it remains important to establish that the human hair follicle dermal papilla has equivalent capabilities. In this study we tested the ability of human hair follicle papillae to induce hair growth when implanted into transected, athymic mouse vibrissa follicles. The implanted papillae that interacted with mouse follicle epithelium created new fibre-producing follicle end bulbs. The origin of the papillae in the recombinant structures was confirmed using laser capture microdissection and human specific gender determination by PCR. The demonstration that intact adult human dermal papillae can induce hair growth has implications for molecular analysis of basic hair growth mechanisms, particularly since the study involved common epithelial-mesenchymal signalling and recognition properties across species.

We have previously shown that the ubiquitously expressed lysosomal cysteine protease, cathepsin L (CTSL), is essential for skin and hair follicle homeostasis. Here we examine the effect of CTSL deficiency on hair follicle development and cycling in ctsl (-/-) mice by light and electron microscopy, Ki67/terminal dUTP nick-end labeling, and trichohyalin immunofluorescence. Hair follicle morphogenesis in ctsl (-/-) mice was associated with several abnormalities. Defective terminal differentiation of keratinocytes occurred during the formation of the hair canal, resulting in disruption of hair shaft outgrowth. Both proliferation and apoptosis levels in keratinocytes and melanocytes were higher in ctsl (-/-) than in ctsl (+/+) hair follicles. The development of the hair follicle pigmentary unit was disrupted by vacuolation of differentiating melanocytes. Hair cycling was also abnormal in ctsl (-/-) mice. Final stages of hair follicle morphogenesis and the induction of hair follicle cycling were retarded. Thereafter, these follicles exhibited a truncated resting phase (telogen) and a premature entry into the first growth phase. Further abnormalities of telogen development included the defective anchoring of club hairs in the skin, which resulted in their abnormal shedding. Melanocyte vacuolation was again apparent during the hair cycle-associated reconstruction of the hair pigmentary unit. A hallmark of these ctsl (-/-) mice was the severe disruption in the exiting of hair shafts to the skin surface. This was mostly because of a failure of the inner root sheath (keratinocyte layer next to the hair shaft) to fully desquamate. These changes resulted in a massive dilation of the hair canal and the abnormal routing of sebaceous gland products to the skin surface. In summary, this study suggests novel roles for cathepsin proteases in skin, hair, and pigment biology. Principal target tissues that may contain protein substrate (s) for this cysteine protease include the developing hair cone, inner root sheath, anchoring apparatus of the telogen club, and organelles of lysosomal origin (eg, melanosomes).",

Disruption of the c-Kit/stem cell factor (SCF) signaling pathway interferes with the survival, migration, and differentiation of melanocytes during generation of the hair follicle pigmentary unit. We examined c-Kit, SCF, and S100 (a marker for precursor melanocytic cells) expression, as well as melanoblast/melanocyte ultrastructure, in perinatal C57BL/6 mouse skin. Before the onset of hair bulb melanogenesis (i. e., stages 0-4 of hair follicle morphogenesis), strong c-Kit immunoreactivity (IR) was seen in selected non-melanogenic cells in the developing hair placode and hair plug. Many of these cells were S100-IR and were ultrastructurally identified as melanoblasts with migratory appearance. During the subsequent stages (5 and 6), increasingly dendritic c-Kit-IR cells successively invaded the hair bulb, while S100-IR gradually disappeared from these cells. Towards the completion of hair follicle morphogenesis (stages 7 and 8), several distinct follicular melanocytic cell populations could be defined and consisted broadly of (a) undifferentiated, non-pigmented c-Kit-negative melanoblasts in the outer root sheath and bulge and (b) highly differentiated melanocytes adjacent to the hair follicle dermal papilla above Auber ' s line. Widespread epithelial SCF-IR was seen throughout hair follicle morphogenesis. These findings suggest that melanoblasts express c-Kit as a prerequisite for migration into the SCF-supplying hair follicle epithelium.

BACKGROUND: Cornified cell envelope (CCE) formation is an important step in the final stage of keratinization, in which CCE precursor proteins including involucrin and loricrin are cross-linked by keratinocyte transglutaminases (TGases) to the inner surface of the plasma membrane of cornified cells, while the outer surface is coated with material derived from secreted lamellar granules. OBJECTIVES: Skin samples from human fetuses of a series of estimated gestational age (EGA) (49-163 days) were studied for the prescence of precursor proteins. Methods TGase activity was studied by in situ TGase activity assay, and ultrastructural features of CCE formation were observed at each stage of hair follicle development. We used immunofluorescent labelling to investigate the time and site of expression of CCE precursor proteins involucrin and loricrin, TGases 1, 2 and 3, and a 25-kDa lamellar granule-associated protein (LGP) in developing human hair follicles. RESULTS: In the hair germ (65-84 days EGA) (corresponding to the stages 1-2 of murine hair follicle morphogenesis), only TGase 2 was observed in the entire hair germ, where in situ TGase activity was weakly positive, although thickening of cell membrane was not seen ultrastructurally. In the hair peg (85-104 days EGA) (corresponding to the stage 3 of murine hair follicle morphogenesis), loricrin and TGase 2 were seen in cells of the upper part of the hair peg while TGase 1, 3 and LGP were observed in the inner cells of the hair peg. In situ TGase activity was weakly positive in the upper part and inner cells of the hair peg. In the bulbous hair peg (105-135 days EGA) (corresponding to the stages 4-6 of murine hair follicle morphogenesis) and differentiated lanugo hair follicle (> 135 days EGA) (corresponding to the stages 7-8 of murine hair follicle morphogenesis), immunoreactivities of involucrin, loricrin, TGase 1, 2, 3, in situ TGase activity and LGP were detected in the inner root sheath cells, hair canals and inner cells of the outer root sheath in the region of the isthmus. Ultrastructurally, thickening of cell membrane was already seen in the inner root sheath cells of the bulbous hair peg and electron-dense, thick CCE was observed in the hair cuticle and hair canal of differentiated lanugo hair follicle. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that, in terms of CCE formation, certain portions of the developing human hair follicle have already been determined in differentiation of the hair canal and cuticle at the hair peg stage.",

Human hair follicles progress independently through the anagen, catagen, telogen and latency phases that correspond to growth arrest and hair shedding before initiation of a new anagen phase. Hair follicles are self-renewing and contain reservoirs of multi-potent stem cells. Identification of the messenger molecules and pathways operating in the growth and cycling of hair follicles, have provided substantial data. However, only a limited number of these signals is well understood. The specific response of hair follicle cells to these signals is correlated with the expression of their corresponding receptors. What regulates these responses ? In this review, we will focus on the hair cycle and its control mechanisms. We will provide some elements in answer to these questions and present some of the markers of hair follicle cells, and hormonal and vascular growth factors, which may regulate respectively hair follicle cell metabolism and cycle, and the neuropeptide impact on hair follicle response and hair growth. The results of our study show the modifications in various expression patterns of receptors in dermal papilla cells, and demonstrate the cross-interaction between these different components. In conclusion, we present an accumulation of evidence suggesting that the regulation of hair growth requires a combination of hormonal, vascular and neuropeptide approaches that will provide further insight in defining new treatments for hair loss.",

The effects of estrogen have predominantly been studied in females ; however, recent studies demonstrate that estrogen also is critical for males. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative functional importance of estrogen receptor alpha and estrogen receptor beta in the regulation of the hair follicle cycling and epidermal thickness in male mice. Seven month old transgenic male mice, lacking estrogen receptor alpha (ERKO), estrogen receptor beta (BERKO), or both receptors (DERKO), were orchidectomized and treated for 3 week with 17beta-estradiol or vehicle. Orchidectomy induced a synchronized anagen phase of the hair follicles, which was inhibited by 17beta-estradiol treatment in wild-type and BERKO mice, but not in ERKO and DERKO mice. Furthermore, 17beta-estradiol treatment increased the thickness of epidermis in wild-type and BERKO mice, but not in ERKO and DERKO. This study demonstrates that estrogen is of importance for the regulation of hair follicle cycling and epidermal thickness in male mice. The effect on hair follicle cycling is caused by an estrogen receptor alpha mediated inhibition of telogen-anagen transition and the effect of estrogen to increase epidermal thickness is associated with an estrogen receptor alpha mediated increase in the proliferative rate of the keratinocytes in the basal cell layer of the epidermis.",

The biologic relevance of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis in the control of hair cycling, however, has remained unknown. We studied the expression and biologic role of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) during the induced adult hair follicle cycle in wild-type, TSP-1 deficient, and TSP-1 overexpressing transgenic mice. TSP-1 expression was absent from hair bulb and dermal papilla cells during early to mid-anagen but was highly upregulated throughout the catagen involution phase. In TSP-1 deficient mice, the follicle growth phase was significantly prolonged, associated with increased perifollicular vascularization and vascular proliferation. Conversely, hair follicle growth was delayed in K14/TSP-1 transgenic mice that expressed high levels of TSP-1 in outer root sheath keratinocytes, associated with reduced perifollicular vascularization. These effects were most probably mediated via its antiangiogenic effects because TSP-1 did not affect the growth of cultured murine vibrissae in the absence of a functional vascular system. These results identify a critical role of TSP-1 in the induction of anagen follicle involution, with potential implications for the therapeutic modulation of hair follicle growth.",

After 24-48 h, hair bulb melanocytes expressing Fas undergo apoptosis. The number of apoptotic follicular melanocytes is significantly reduced (p < 0. 01) in cyclophosphamide-treated Fas knockout mice compared to wild-type controls, suggesting that Fas signaling contributes to chemotherapy-induced melanocyte death. After 3-5 d, surviving hair bulb melanocytes express c-kit receptor, proliferate, and appear to migrate up the outer root sheath. Tyrosinase-positive and melanogenically active cells then appear in the epidermis. By Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, expression levels of the c-kit ligand, stem cell factor, in skin and epidermis are strongly increased after cyclophosphamide treatment. Cyclophosphamide-induced migration of the hair follicle melanocytes into epidermis is completely abrogated by administration of c-kit neutralizing antibody.

Furthermore, such multipotent stem cells may represent the ultimate epidermal stem cell. Another example of epithelial stem cell and transit amplifying cell plasticity, was the demonstration that adult corneal epithelium, under the influence of embryonic skin dermis could form an epidermis as well as hair follicles. With regards to the location of follicular epithelial stem cells, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural data was presented, indicating that cells with stem cell attributes were localized to the prominent bulge region of developing human fetal hair follicles.

During hair follicle morphogenesis, melanocyte precursors migrate into developing hair follicles and give rise to differentiated melanocytes that actively produce and transport pigment into the keratinocytes that form the hair shaft ; however, patterns of melanocyte proliferation and differentiation during formation of the hair pigmentation unit remain to be elucidated. Using multicolor confocal microscopy and double immunofluorescence of melanogenic proteins (tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2, tyrosinase) and the proliferative marker Ki67, we have studied melanocyte development in C57BL/6 mouse embryonic hair follicles. Proliferating melanocyte precursors (tyrosinase-related protein-2/Ki67 + cells) are seen in the hair follicles at stages 1-2 of morphogenesis, as follicular invagination begins. In stage 3-4 hair follicles, the majority of intrafollicular melanocytes remain tyrosinase-related protein-2 + and Ki67 +, whereas some located adjacent to the forming dermal papilla begin to express tyrosinase-related protein-1, an early marker of differentiation. Melanin granules appear in stage 5 hair follicles coincident with tyrosinase expression in nonproliferating tyrosinase-related protein-2 +/tyrosinase-related protein-1 + melanocytes. Stage 6-8 hair follicles, those actively producing hair, show nonproliferating tyrosinase-related protein-2 + melanocytes in the bulge area, tyrosinase-related protein-2 +/tyrosinase-related protein-1 + melanocytes in the outer root sheath, and tyrosinase-related protein-2 +/tyrosinase-related protein-1 +/tyrosinase + melanocytes above the dermal papilla. These data suggest that melanocyte precursor cells proliferate extensively at the onset of follicle development.

We found that epimorphin was produced by follicular mesenchymal cells and bound selectively to follicular epithelial cells, and that treatment with recombinant epimorphin could stimulate procession of hair follicles from telogen (resting stage) to anagen (growing stage). Based on analyses of epimorphin proteolytic digests that suggested a smaller peptide might be able to substitute for the full-length epimorphin molecule, we determined that pep7, a 10-amino acid peptide, was capable of inducing telogen-to-anagen transition both in the culture assay and in the mouse. That pep7 showed maximal activity only when modified with specific sulfhydryl-reactive reagents suggested that a particular structural conformation of the peptide was essential for activity ; molecular dynamics studies were pursued to investigate the active peptide structure.

The adult hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) and dermal sheath (DS) cells are developmentally active cell populations with a proven role in adult hair follicle-cycling activity and unique inductive powers. In stem cell biology, the hair follicle epithelium has recently been the subject of a great deal of investigation, but up to now, the follicle dermis has been largely overlooked as a source of stem cells. Following the sporadic appearance of muscle, lipid and bone-type cells in discretely isolated follicle DP and DS cell primary cultures, we demonstrated that cultured papilla and sheath cell lines were capable of being directed to lipid and bone differentiation. Subsequently, for the first time, we produced clonal DP and DS lines that had extended proliferative capabilities. Dye exclusion has been reported to be an identifying feature of stem cells ; therefore, clonal papilla and sheath lines with differing capacity to exclude rhodamine 123 were cultured in medium known to induce adipocyte and osteocyte differentiation. Both DS-and DP-derived clones showed the capacity to make lipid and to produce calcified material ; however, different clones had varied behaviour and there was no obvious correlation between their stem cell capabilities and dye exclusion or selected gene expression markers. As a highly accessible source, capable of being discretely isolated, the follicle has important potentially as a stem cell source for tissue engineering and cell therapy purposes. It will also be interesting to compare follicle dermal stem cell properties with the broader stem cell capabilities discovered in skin dermis and investigate whether, as we believe, the follicle is a key dermal stem cell niche. Finally, the discovery of stem cells in the dermis may have implications for certain pathologies in which abnormal differentiation occurs in the skin.",

Previous work had shown that most members of the complex human hair keratin family were expressed in terminal scalp hairs. An exception to this rule was the type I hair keratin hHa7, which was only detected in some but not all vellus hairs of the human scalp (Langbein et al, 1999). Here we show that hHa7 exhibits constitutive expression in medullary cells of all types of male and female sexual hairs. Medullated beard, axillary, and pubic hairs arise during puberty from small, unmedullated vellus hairs under the influence of circulating androgens. This suggested an androgen-controlled expression of the hHa7 gene. Further evidence for this assumption was provided by the demonstration of androgen receptor (AR) expression in the nuclei of medullary cells of beard hairs. Moreover, homology search for the semipalindromic androgen receptor-binding element (ARE) consensus sequence GG (A)/(T) ACAnnnTGTTCT in the proximal hHa7 promoter revealed three putative ARE motifs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the specific binding of AR to all three hHa7 AREs. Their function as AR-responsive elements, either individually or in concert within the hHa7 promoter, could be further confirmed by transfection studies with or without an AR expression vector in PtK2 and prostate PC3-Arwt cells, respectively in the presence or absence of a synthetic androgen. Our study detected hHa7 as the first gene in hair follicle trichocytes whose expression appears to be directly regulated by androgens. As such, hHa7 represents a marker for androgen action on hair follicles and might be a suitable tool for investigations of androgen-dependent hair disorders.",

The pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, are important mediators of human skin pigmentation via action at the melanocortin-1 receptor. Recent data suggests that such a regulatory role also exists for the endogenous opiate, beta-endorphin (beta-END). A role for this beta-END in the regulation of follicular pigmentation, however, has not been determined. This study was designed to examine the involvement of the beta-END/mu-opiate receptor system in human follicular melanocyte biology. We employed RT-PCR, and immunohisto/cytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy using beta-END and mu-opiate receptor specific antibodies and a functional role for beta-END was assessed by direct stimulation with the peptide. This study has demonstrated that human hair follicle melanocytes (HFM) express mRNA for the mu-opiate receptor and POMC. Furthermore, beta-END and its high affinity mu-opiate receptor are expressed at the protein level in glycoprotein100-positive follicular melanocytes and as a function of their anatomic location and differentiation status during the hair growth cycle. Functional studies revealed that beta-END is a modifier of HFM phenotype via its ability to upregulate melanogenesis, dendricity, and proliferation. These findings suggest a new regulatory role for beta-END in human HFM biology, providing a new research direction into the fundamental regulation of human hair pigmentation.",

    "text": "The role of BMP signalling in the control of ID3 expression in the hair follicle. Both the production of the hair shaft in anagen and the initiation of a new hair cycle at telogen are the result of reciprocal interactions between the dermal papilla and the overlying epithelial cells. Secreted factors, such as those of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, play a crucial role in moderating these interactions. Analysis of hair follicles in different stages of the hair cycle showed that BMP signalling was only active during anagen and again during telogen. During catagen, no BMP signalling occurred in the dermal papilla. ID3, a gene expressed in the dermal papilla of both vibrissa and pelage follicles, is a BMP target, and as such, we found that ID3 was expressed from the earliest stages of morphogenesis. During the hair cycle, ID3 was only expressed in the dermal papilla at middle anagen and telogen. To test the significance of ID3 expression in the dermal papilla, we cultured dermal papilla cells and found that ID3 expression fell significantly after a single passage. ID3 expression was returned to in vivo levels in low-and high-passage cells by culturing to high confluence or by the addition of BMP4. These studies reinforce the requirement for active BMP signalling and cell-cell contacts in the dermal papilla during specific stages in the hair cycle.",

Minoxidil induces new hair growth in approximately one-third of patients with androgenetic alopecia after 1 year of treatment. With several conflicting reports in the literature based on small-scale studies, the current study aimed to clarify whether organ culture of human scalp anagen VI hair follicles is a suitable in vitro test system for reproducing, and experimentally dissecting, the recognized in vivo hair-growth-promoting capacity of minoxidil. Hair shaft elongation was studied in terminal anagen VI hair follicles microdissected from the occipital scalp of 36 healthy adults. A total of 2300 hair follicles, approximately 65 per individual, were tested using modifications of a basic organ culture protocol. It is shown here that minoxidil does not significantly increase hair shaft elongation or the duration of anagen VI in ex vivo culture despite several enhancements on the conventional methodology. This disparity to what is seen clinically in minoxidil responders may be explained by the following: (i) use of occipital (rather than frontotemporal or vertex) hair follicles ; (ii) use of, already maximally growing, anagen VI hair follicles ; (iii) a predominance of hair follicles from minoxidil unresponsive-donors ; (iv) use of minoxidil rather than its sulfate metabolite ; and/or (v) use of a suboptimal minoxidil dosage. This disparity questions the usefulness of standard human hair follicle organ culture in minoxidil research. Unexpectedly, minoxidil even inhibited hair shaft elongation in the absence of insulin, which may indicate that the actual hair-growth-modulatory effects of minoxidil depend on the concomitant local presence/absence of other growth modulators.",

Cell adhesion assays showed that QBRICK was active in mediating cell-substratum adhesion through integrins containing alphav or alpha8 chain, but not integrin alpha5beta1. Immunohistochemistry showed that QBRICK colocalized with alphav-containing integrins in the interfollicular region, but with the alpha8-containing integrin at the tip region of developing hair follicles.

De novo hair follicle formation in embryonic skin and new hair growth in adult skin are initiated when specialized mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP) cells send cues to multipotent epithelial stem cells. Subsequently, DP cells are enveloped by epithelial stem cell progeny and other cell types to form a niche orchestrating hair growth. Understanding the general biological principles that govern the mesenchymal-epithelial interactions within the DP niche, however, has been hampered so far by the lack of systematic approaches to dissect the complete molecular make-up of this complex tissue. Here, we take a novel multicolor labeling approach, using cell type-specific transgenic expression of red and green fluorescent proteins in combination with immunolabeling of specific antigens, to isolate pure populations of DP and four of its surrounding cell types: dermal fibroblasts, melanocytes, and two different populations of epithelial progenitors (matrix and outer root sheath cells). By defining their transcriptional profiles, we develop molecular signatures characteristic for the DP and its niche. Validating the functional importance of these signatures is a group of genes linked to hair disorders that have been largely unexplored. Additionally, the DP signature reveals novel signaling and transcription regulators that distinguish them from other cell types. The mesenchymal-epithelial signatures include key factors previously implicated in ectodermal-neural fate determination, as well as a myriad of regulators of bone morphogenetic protein signaling. These findings establish a foundation for future functional analyses of the roles of these genes in hair development. Overall, our strategy illustrates how knowledge of the genes uniquely expressed by each cell type residing in a complex niche can reveal important new insights into the biology of the tissue and its associated disease states.",

Seventy percent of Smad4 (co/co) ; K5-Cre mice developed spontaneous tumors within 12 months of birth. c-Myc and cyclin D1 were up-regulated whereas p21 and p27 expressions were decreased, which correlated with the epidermal hyperplasia in Smad4 mutants.

In microdissected human scalp anagen hair bulbs, mRNA for NGF, pro-NGF, p75NTR, and TrkA was transcribed. Immunohistomorphometry and in situ hybridization detected strong NGF and pro-NGF expression in terminally differentiating inner root sheath keratinocytes, whereas TrkA was co-expressed with p75NTR in basal and suprabasal outer root sheath keratinocytes. During spontaneous catagen development of organ-cultured human anagen hair follicles, p75NTR mRNA levels rose, and p75NTR and pro-NGF immunoreactivity increased dramatically in involuting compartments primarily devoid of TrkA expression. Here, TUNEL (+) apoptotic cells showed prominent p75NTR expression. Joint pro-NGF/NGF administration inhibited hair shaft elongation and accelerated catagen development in culture, which was antagonized by co-administration of p75NTR-blocking antibodies. In addition, mRNA and protein expression of transforming growth factor-beta2 increased early during spontaneous catagen development, and its neutralization blocked pro-NGF/NGF-dependent hair growth inhibition.

BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein (HSP) is a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding, assembly, and transport and in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. HSP27 protein is expressed in murine hair follicle (HF) and in human skin during fetal development. In this investigation we hypothesized that HSP27 protein is expressed in the human scalp skin and its expression in HF changes with the transitions form anagen--> catagen--> telogen stages. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, the immunoreactivity of HSP27 protein was examined in human scalp skin by immunofluorescent method. A total of 50 normal human scalp skin biopsy specimens were examined (healthy women, age 53-57 years). In each case, 50 HF were analyzed (35, 10, and 5 follicles in anagen, catagen, and telogen, respectively). RESULTS: HSP27 protein expression was prominent in human scalp anagen, and weak in both catagen and telogen HFs. Within HF, HSP27 protein immunoreactivity was prominent in the outer root sheath, inner root sheath, precorteocytes, and corteocytes of the hair shaft. In addition, HSP27 protein expression was prominent in the epidermis, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and arrector pili muscles. LIMITATIONS: Only some types of heat shock proteins are known to date. Also, our knowledge about the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions among these protein and other molecular chaperones is still incomplete. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation reports, for the first time, the expression patterns of HSP27 in human scalp skin and HF. The differential expression of HSP27 during HF cycling suggests its possible roles in human HF biology.",

BACKGROUND: Premature desquamation of the inner root sheath (IRS) is described as a defining histologic feature of follicular degeneration syndrome/central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA). However, IRS abnormalities have been noted in other types of alopecia. DESIGN: We evaluated the IRS in terminal hair follicles with transverse sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Ziehl-Neelsen stains in 22 non-scarring (7 areata and 15 androgenetic) and 21 scarring (13 CCCA, 2 lichen planopilaris, 2 lupus erythematosus, 1 folliculitis decalvans and 3 end stage) alopecia cases. In addition, we evaluated 15 normal controls with longitudinal sections to establish the level of IRS desquamation. RESULTS: The IRS was present in 99. 5 +/-0. 01% (mean +/-standard error) of normal follicles at the level of the arrector pili muscle/sebaceous gland/sweat gland coil (L2) and variably present at higher levels. The IRS was present at L2 in 97. 9 +/-1. 5% of alopecia areata, 87. 4 +/-5. 3% of androgenetic alopecia, 59. 3 +/-7. 0% of CCCA and 49. 4 +/-11. 3% of other scarring alopecia follicles. CONCLUSIONS: Premature desquamation of the IRS was identified in CCCA ; however, it was also noted in other scarring alopecia cases.

Transthyretin helps internalize thyroxine and retinol-binding protein into cells by binding to megalin, which is a multi-ligand receptor expressed on the luminal surface of various epithelia. We investigated the expression of transthyretin and its receptor megalin in the human skin ; however, their expression pattern in the hair follicle is still to be elucidated. This study addresses this issue and tests the hypothesis that \" \" the expression of transthyretin and megalin undergoes hair follicle cycle-dependent changes. \" \" A total of 50 normal human scalp skin biopsies were examined (healthy females, 53-62 years) using immunofluorescence staining methods and real-time PCR.

    "text": "Improved hair restoration method for burns. BACKGROUND: Extracted partial longitudinal follicular units can be used as complete follicular units to regenerate completely differentiated hair growth. The partial follicular units that remained in the dermis in the donor area can survive and produce hairs. This technique enables us to multiply hair follicles in vivo, while preserving the donor area and therefore is suitable in persons, who have a relative small donor area compared to the recipient area, as in scalp burns. OBJECTIVES: With this study, we try to determine if partial longitudinal follicular unit transplantation (PL-FUT) can be used for facial and/or scalp burns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four burn victims (age 22-39 years, mean 27. 75 years) were treated in the face (eyebrows, and beard) and/or on the scalp with PL-FUT. The grafts were harvested with hollow wave-tipped needles with an inner diameter of 0. 6mm from the occipital area of the scalp. The suitable longitudinal partial follicular units were impregnated with a preservative medium, and implanted into the recipient area. Hair growth in the donor area as well as the recipient area was observed before treatment, and at intervals of 1 week, 3 months and 1 year after the treatment. RESULTS: After evaluation of the donor area, sometimes a few little white spots were visible, but almost all hair follicles in the donor site re-produce hairs after 2 years. All treated patients had satisfactory or very satisfactory cosmetic results in the treated area. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal partial follicular unit transplantation (LP-FUT) may represent the first reliable patient-friendly method to generate two hair follicles from one hair follicle with consistent results and preservation of the donor area. Therefore, this method is very suitable for people with facial and/or scalp burns.",

Since there are no data regarding cannabinoid receptors in hair follicles of domestic animals, we investigated the presence and localization of CB1 receptor in dog hair follicles. By using a goat anti-CB1 polyclonal antibody, we observed CB1 receptor in the proximal part of both primary and secondary hair follicles. Staining was localized in the inner root sheath cells. We suppose that the endo-cannabinoid system is involved in the molecular mechanisms regulating hair follicle activity in dog.

BACKGROUND: Mammalian hair development and tooth development are controlled by a series of reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Similar growth factors and transcription factors, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), sonic hedgehog homolog (SHH), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt10a, were reported to be involved in both of these interactions. Dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and phosphophoryn (PP) are the two major non-collagenous proteins secreted by odontoblasts that participate in dentin mineralization during tooth development. Because of striking similarities between tooth development and hair follicle development, we investigated whether DSP and/or PP proteins may also play a role in hair follicle development. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined the presence and location of DSP/PP proteins during hair follicle development. METHODS: Rat PP proteins were detected using immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent staining. DSP-PP mRNAs were detected by in situ hybridization with riboprobes. LacZ expression was detected in mouse tissues using a DSP-PP promoter-driven LUC in transgenic mice. RESULTS: We found that PP proteins and DSP-PP mRNAs are present in rat hair follicles. We also demonstrate that an 8 kb DSP-PP promoter is able to drive lacZ expression in hair follicles. CONCLUSION: We have firmly established the presence of DSP/PP in mouse and rat hair follicles by immunohistochemical/immunofluorescent staining, in situ hybridization with riboprobes and transgenic mice studies. The expression of DSP/PP in hair follicles is the first demonstration that major mineralization proteins likely may also contribute to soft tissue development.

A 50% increase in hair length and a 30% increase in the number of papilla cells were explained by the changes in the telogen/anagen hair follicle phases.

Clinical observations have demonstrated that estrogen raises the telogen/anagen ratio and inhibits hair shaft elongation of female scalp hair follicles. In spite of these clinical insights, the properties of estrogen on hair follicles are poorly dissected. In the present study, we show that estrogen induced apoptosis of precortex cells and caused premature catagen by up-regulation of TGF beta2. Immediately after the premature catagen, the expression of anagen chalone BMP4 increased. The up-regulation of BMP4 may further function to prevent anagen transition and maintain telogen. Interestingly, the hair follicle stem cell niche was not destructed during these drastic structural changes caused by estrogen. Additionally, dermal papilla cells, the estrogen target cells in hair follicles, kept their signature gene expressions as well as their hair inductive potential after estrogen treatment. Retention of the characteristics of both hair follicle stem cells and dermal papilla cells determined the reversibility of the hair cycle suppression.

    "text": "Dopamine is a novel, direct inducer of catagen in human scalp hair follicles in vitro. BACKGROUND: Although there are clinical reports of hair loss associated with levodopa and dopamine agonists, it is unclear whether dopamine exerts any direct effects on the human hair follicle (HF). OBJECTIVES: Given the widespread use of dopamine agonists and antagonists in clinical medicine, we sought to determine whether dopamine exerts direct effects on human HF growth and/or pigmentation in vitro, and whether human HFs express dopamine receptors (DRs). METHODS: Microdissected human scalp HFs from women were treated in serum-free organ culture for 7 days with dopamine (10-1000 nmol L), and the effects on hair shaft production, HF cycling (i. e. anagen-catagen transition), hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and HF pigmentation were measured by quantitative (immuno-) histomorphometry. RESULTS: Dopamine had no consistent effect on hair shaft production, but did promote HF regression (catagen). It was also associated with significantly reduced proliferation of HF matrix keratinocytes (P < 0 01) and reduced intrafollicular melanin production. Dopamine receptor transcripts were identified in HFs and skin. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that dopamine is an inhibitor of human hair growth, via the promotion of catagen induction, at least in vitro. This may offer a rational explanation for the induction of telogen effluvium in some women treated with dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine. Moreover, dopaminergic agonists deserve further exploration as novel inhibitors of unwanted human hair growth (hirsutism, hypertrichosis).",

    "text": "Characterization of hairless (Hr) and FGF5 genes provides insights into the molecular basis of hair loss in cetaceans. BACKGROUND: Hair is one of the main distinguishing characteristics of mammals and it has many important biological functions. Cetaceans originated from terrestrial mammals and they have evolved a series of adaptations to aquatic environments, which are of evolutionary significance. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their aquatic adaptations have not been well explored. This study provided insights into the evolution of hair loss during the transition from land to water by investigating and comparing two essential regulators of hair follicle development and hair follicle cycling, i. e., the Hairless (Hr) and FGF5 genes, in representative cetaceans and their terrestrial relatives. RESULTS: The full open reading frame sequences of the Hr and FGF5 genes were characterized in seven cetaceans. The sequence characteristics and evolutionary analyses suggested the functional loss of the Hr gene in cetaceans, which supports the loss of hair during their full adaptation to aquatic habitats. By contrast, positive selection for the FGF5 gene was found in cetaceans where a series of positively selected amino acid residues were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the molecular basis of the hair loss in cetaceans. Our investigation of Hr and FGF5, two indispensable regulators of the hair cycle, provide some new insights into the molecular basis of hair loss in cetaceans. The results suggest that positive selection for the FGF5 gene might have promoted the termination of hair growth and early entry into the catagen stage of hair follicle cycling. Consequently, the hair follicle cycle was disrupted and the hair was lost completely due to the loss of the Hr gene function in cetaceans. This suggests that cetaceans have evolved an effective and complex mechanism for hair loss.",

Adipose-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells are heterogeneous in nature, containing a number of different cell types. Recent studies indicate that CD34 may be a specific marker for adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs). Using their participation in hair morphogenesis as a model, the multi-differentiation potential of adult stem cells was investigated. In addition, adipose tissue or adipogenic lineage cells appear to be associated with the hair follicle cycle. The purpose of this study was to test the potential of CD34 + cells enriched from fat tissue in hair morphogenesis. To investigate this, unsorted SVF, CD34 + and CD34-cells sorted from the SVF of green fluorescence protein (GFP) transgenic mice were mixed with fetal mouse keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts of gestational day 17. 5 (E17. 5) and then subcutaneously injected into nude mice. The results showed that in the reconstituted skin tissue, larger tissue blocks with more developed hair follicles were observed in the CD34 + cell group compared with the other two groups. Histological and immunofluorescent staining analyses revealed that only CD34 + cells may participate in hair morphogenesis by their integration into dermal sheath structures. However, no involvement in other skin appendages was observed. In addition, differentiation into endothelial cells and participation in blood vessel formation were also observed in both CD34 + and SVF cells, but not in CD34-cells. As expected, participation in adipogenesis was observed in all groups. Our results suggest that CD34 + cells may represent the ADMSCs which possess stronger multiple differentiation potential during reconstituted skin development.",

PURPOSE: To determine putative limbal epithelial stem cell marker expression in human limbal dermoids compared to stem cell niches in normal limbus and hair follicles of normal human dermis. METHODS: Human limbal dermoids (n = 7), normal skin (n = 2) and normal limbal (n = 7) tissue were examined. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin embedded specimens using automated and manual immunostaining with primary antibodies to CK15, CK14, Cadherin-P (CDH3), Wnt-3, Wnt-4, Wnt-5a, Dickkopf (DKK)-3, Sox-2, Sox-10, Sox-13, PEDF, NGFR p75 and beta-catenin. RESULTS: Positive immunostaining was found for CK15, CK14, CDH3, NGFR p75, PEDF, Sox-2, Sox-10 and Wnt 4 in the basal dermoid epithelium, limbus and hair follicles. Suprabasal epithelium was immunostained with PEDF, Sox-2 and Wnt-4 in these tissues. The sebaceous and sweat glands, vascular endothelium and nerves of the limbal dermoid immunostained with PEDF and Sox-2. Sebaceous and sweat glands stained for Sox-10. DKK-3 immunostaining occurred in the dermoids ' suprabasal epithelium and vascular endothelium but not in the limbus or hair follicle.

    "text": "Valproic acid promotes human hair growth in in vitro culture model. BACKGROUND: beta-Catenin, the transducer of Wnt signaling, is critical for the development and growth of hair follicles. In the absence of Wnt signals, cytoplasmic beta-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 and then degraded. Therefore, inhibition of GSK-3 may enhance hair growth via beta-catenin stabilization. Valproic acid is an anticonvulsant and a mood-stabilizing drug that has been used for decades. Recently, valproic acid was reported to inhibit GSK-3beta in neuronal cells, but its effect on human hair follicles remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of VPA on human hair growth. METHODS: We investigated the effect of VPA on cultured human dermal papilla cells and outer root sheath cells and on an in vitro culture of human hair follicles, which were obtained from scalp skin samples of healthy volunteers. Anagen induction by valproic acid was evaluated using C57BL/6 mice model. RESULTS: Valproic acid not only enhanced the viability of human dermal papilla cells and outer root sheath cells but also promoted elongation of the hair shaft and reduced catagen transition of human hair follicles in organ culture model. Valproic acid treatment of human dermal papilla cells led to increased beta-catenin levels and nuclear accumulation and inhibition of GSK-3beta by phosphorylation. In addition, valproic acid treatment accelerated the induction of anagen hair in 7-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. CONCLUSIONS: Valproic acid enhanced human hair growth by increasing beta-catenin and therefore may serve as an alternative therapeutic option for alopecia.",

    "text": "Discovery of cashmere goat (Capra hircus) microRNAs in skin and hair follicles by Solexa sequencing. BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a large family of endogenous, non-coding RNAs, about 22 nucleotides long, which regulate gene expression through sequence-specific base pairing with target mRNAs. Extensive studies have shown that miRNA expression in the skin changes remarkably during distinct stages of the hair cycle in humans, mice, goats and sheep. RESULTS: In this study, the skin tissues were harvested from the three stages of hair follicle cycling (anagen, catagen and telogen) in a fibre-producing goat breed. In total, 63, 109, 004 raw reads were obtained by Solexa sequencing and 61, 125, 752 clean reads remained for the small RNA digitalisation analysis. This resulted in the identification of 399 conserved miRNAs ; among these, 326 miRNAs were expressed in all three follicular cycling stages, whereas 3, 12 and 11 miRNAs were specifically expressed in anagen, catagen, and telogen, respectively. We also identified 172 potential novel miRNAs by Mireap, 36 miRNAs were expressed in all three cycling stages, whereas 23, 29 and 44 miRNAs were specifically expressed in anagen, catagen, and telogen, respectively. The expression level of five arbitrarily selected miRNAs was analyzed by quantitative PCR, and the results indicated that the expression patterns were consistent with the Solexa sequencing results. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analyses indicated that five major biological pathways (Metabolic pathways, Pathways in cancer, MAPK signalling pathway, Endocytosis and Focal adhesion) accounted for 23. 08% of target genes among 278 biological functions, indicating that these pathways are likely to play significant roles during hair cycling. CONCLUSIONS: During all hair cycle stages of cashmere goats, a large number of conserved and novel miRNAs were identified through a high-throughput sequencing approach. This study enriches the Capra hircus miRNA databases and provides a comprehensive miRNA transcriptome profile in the skin of goats during the hair follicle cycle.",

    "text": "Age-induced hair greying-the multiple effects of oxidative stress. An obvious sign of ageing is hair greying, or the loss of pigment production and deposition within the hair shafts. Numerous mechanisms, acting at different levels and follicular locations, contribute to hair greying, ranging from melanocyte stem cells defects to follicular melanocyte death. One key issue that is in common to these processes is oxidative damage. At the hair follicle stem cells niche, oxidative stress, accelerated by B-cell lymphoma 2 gene (BCL-2) depletion, leads to selective apoptosis and diminution of melanocyte stem cells, reducing the repopulation of newly formed anagen follicles. Melanotic bulbar melanocytes express high levels of BCL-2 to enable survival from melanogenesis-and ultraviolet A (UVA)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) attacks. With ageing, the bulbar melanocyte expression of anti-oxidant proteins such as BCL-2, and possibly TRP-2, is reduced, and the dedicated enzymatic anti-oxidant defence system throughout the follicle weakens, resulting in enhanced oxidative stress. A marked reduction in catalase expression and activity results in millimolar accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, contributing to bulbar melanocyte malfunction and death. Interestingly, amelanotic melanocytes at the outer root sheath (ORS) are somewhat less affected by these processes and survive for longer time even within the white, ageing hair follicles. Better understanding of the overtime susceptibility of melanocytes to oxidative stress at the different follicular locations might yield clues to possible therapies for the prevention and reversal of hair greying.",

It is clear that the dermal papilla cell (DPC), which is located at the bottom of the hair follicle, is a special mesenchymal component, and it plays a leading role in regulating hair follicle development and periodic regeneration. Recent studies showed that the Wnt signaling pathway through beta-catenin (canonical Wnt signaling pathway) is an essential component in maintaining the hair-inducing activity of the dermal papilla and growth of hair papilla cells. However, the intrinsic pathways and regulating mechanism are largely unknown. In the previous work, we constructed a cDNA subtractive library of DPC and first found that the TCF4 gene, as a key factor of Wnt signaling pathway, was expressed as the upregulated gene of the hair follicle in low-passage DPC. This study was to explore the role of TCF4 in regulating the proliferation and secretory activity of DPC. We constructed a pcDNA3. 0-TCF4 expression vector and transfected it into DPC to achieve stable expression by bangosome 2000. Furthermore, we used the method of chemosynthesis to synthesize three pairs of TCF4 siRNA and transfected them into DPC. Meanwhile, we compared the transfection group and non-transfection group.

Investigations on carrier-based drug delivery systems for higher selectivity in hair therapy have clearly evolved from dye release and model studies to highly sophisticated approaches, many of which specifically tackle hair indications and the delivery of hair-relevant molecules. Here, we group recent hair disease-oriented work into efforts towards (i) improved delivery of conventional drugs, (ii) delivery of novel drug classes, for example biomolecules and (iii) targeted delivery on the cellular/molecular level. Considering the solid foundation of experimental work, it does not take a large step outside the current box of thinking to follow the idea of using large carriers (> 500 nm, unlikely to penetrate as a whole) for follicular penetration, retention and protection of sensitive compounds. Yet, reports on particles < 200 nm being internalized by keratinocytes and dendritic cells at sites of barrier disruption (e. g., hair follicles) combined with recent advances in nanodermatology add interesting new facets to the possibilities carrier technologies could offer, for example, unprecedented levels of selectivity. The authors provide thought-provoking ideas on how smart delivery technologies and advances in our molecular understanding of hair pathophysiology could result in a whole new era of hair therapeutics. As the field still largely remains in preclinical investigation, determined efforts towards production of medical grade material and truly translational work are needed to demonstrate surplus value of carrier systems for clinical applications.",

The use of herbal mixtures in the hair growth market has increased dramatically over the last decade. In this study, we investigated the hair growth-promoting activity of CARI ONE, a mixture of medicinal plants and mushrooms, in telogenic 6-week-old C57BL/6N mice. CARI ONE promoted hair growth through stimulation of the telogen to anagen transition. Histomorphometry analysis data indicated that topical application of CARI ONE induced an earlier anagen phase and prolonged the mature anagen phase, and also increased the number and size of hair follicles (HFs) as compared to either the control or 1% minoxidil-treated group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed an earlier induction of beta-catenin and Trp-1 protein in the HFs of the CARI ONE-treated group compared to that in the control group or 1% minoxidil-treated group. In vitro, CARI ONE promoted the proliferation of dermal papilla cells and resulted in increased melanin content in B16F10 cells in a dose-dependent manner without affecting cell viability. These results suggest that CARI ONE promotes hair growth through induction of the anagen phase in resting HFs.",

    "text": "Age-dependent changes in damage processes of hair cuticle. BACKGROUND: Human hair cuticle is always exposed to various stresses and then gradually lost in daily life. There are two typical patterns of cuticle damage: type L, where the cell membrane complex, the structure located between cuticle cells, is split and the cuticle lifts up, and type E, where the fragile substructure of the cuticle cell (endocuticle) is damaged so that its rugged residue is exposed. We previously reported that type L damage preferentially occurs in the case of Japanese females in their 20s to 40s. AIMS: This study aims to elucidate the age-dependent change of cuticle and its effect on hair properties. METHODS: Hair fibers collected from Japanese females (ranging from 10 to 70 years old) were evaluated in the aspects of inclination for each type of damage, resistance of cuticle against grooming stresses and content of fatty acid 18-MEA on hair surface. RESULTS: It was revealed that the dominant damage pattern shifts from type L to E with aging. Furthermore, the cuticle becomes gradually less resistant to daily grooming stress. The dominance of type E damage accelerates cuticle loss. Reduction of 18-MEA on weathered hair is accelerated with aging on elder hair. CONCLUSIONS: It has been reported that various age-dependent changes of whole hair shaft, such as diameter, density, elasticity, etc., occur in the age range of 40s and 50s. In this study, it was revealed that cuticle becomes more fragile and the hair surface properties deteriorate in the same age range.",

AIMS: Recently, immature adipocyte lineage cells have been suggested as a potential hair-growth stimulator. Diverse studies have been attempted to find methods for the preconditioning of immature adipocyte lineage cells. The present study investigates the effect of conditioned medium (CM) from vitamin D3 (Vd3) pre-activated preadipocytes on hair-growth ability. MAIN METHODS: To test the effect of CM from Vd3 pre-activated preadipocytes on hair-growth efficiency in mice, we compared the differences in hair regenerated after injecting CM from mouse preadipocytes pre-activated with or without Vd3. Next, to determine the regulating factors, the VEGF level was measured by ELISA and angiogenesis level was evaluated by IHC. Finally, the signaling mechanism was investigated by inhibitor kinase assay and western blotting. KEY FINDINGS: The CM from Vd3 pre-activated preadipocyte injection markedly promoted the ability of hair regeneration in mice. The VEGF levels were increased by Vd3 treatment in vitro and the CM from Vd3 pre-activated preadipocytes significantly increased the angiogenesis in vivo, suggesting the involvement of angiognensis in the hair regeneration induced by CM from pre-activated preadipocytes. In signaling study, Vd3-enhanced VEGF production was reduced by an ERK1/2 inhibitor and the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased by treatment with Vd3. SIGNIFICANCE: This has been the first report on CM from Vd3 pre-activated preadipocyte displaying stimulatory effects on hair growth via the enhancement of angiogenesis in a hairless-induced C57BL/6 mice.",

Mammals use tactile end-organs to perform sensory tasks such as environmental exploration, social interaction, and tactile discrimination. However, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tactile transduction in tactile end-organs remain poorly understood. The patch-clamp recording technique may be the most valuable approach for detecting and studying tactile transduction in tactile end-organs, but it is technically challenging because tactile transduction elements in an end-organ are normally inaccessible by patch-clamp recording electrodes. Here we describe an in situ patch-clamp recording protocol for the study of tactile transduction in Merkel cells of rat whisker hair follicles, one of the most sensitive tactile end-organs in mammals. This technique offers an opportunity to explore the identities and properties of ion channels that are involved in tactile transduction in whisker hair follicles, and it may also lend a useful tool for researchers to study other tactile end-organs. The experimental protocol describes procedures for 1) tissue dissection and whisker hair follicle preparation, 2) device setup and steps for performing patch-clamp recordings from Merkel cells in a whisker hair follicle, 3) methods of delivering mechanical stimuli, and 4) intra-follicle microinjection for receptor knockdown in whisker hair follicles. The main procedures in this protocol, from tissue preparation to whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, can be completed in a few hours.",

Each wavelength was selected by choosing four peak wavelengths from an action spectrum in the range 580 to 860 nm. The laser treatment was performed on alternating days over a 2-week period. The energy density was set to 1. 27 J/cm (2) for the first four treatments and 1. 91 J/cm (2) for the last four treatments. At the end of the experiment, both photographic and histological examinations were performed to evaluate the effect of laser wavelength on hair growth.

Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in dermal papilla cells was observed after oleuropein treatment. Topical application of oleuropein (0. 4 mg/mouse/day) to C57BL/6N mice accelerated the hair-growth induction and increased the size of hair follicles in telogenic mouse skin.

Ten cashmere goats of one-year old (5 males, 5 females) were included in this study. The density and activity of SF were observed and measured by making paraffin sections, the ultra-structural features of SF were studied under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by making ultra-thin sections, and the expression of Hoxc13 was investigated through the immunohistochemistry method. The average diameter of SF had the smallest value in the anagen stage, and significant difference (P < 0. 05) was found between the anagen stage and other stages. The density of SF increased gradually through the different growing stages, and significant difference was found between the anagen and procatagen stages (P < 0. 05). With an increase in time (months), the percentage of SF activity increased, and significant difference in the percentage of SF activity was found between the telogen and anagen stages (P < 0. 05). At the telogen stage, the layers of connective tissue sheath (CTS) of SF were unclear, hemidesmosomes between the outer root sheath (ORS) and basement membrane disappeared, and dead cells were found at the top of the SF. The rudiments of new SF were found in the proanagen stage, CTS was thickened, and the cells of ORS were stretched out like fingers. At the anagen stage, the structure of SF was integral, and the inner root sheath (IRS) consisted of three concentric layers (Helen, Huxley, and Cuticle layers). The cells of Huxley ' s layer degenerated gradually, and pseudopodia were formed on the cells of ORS in the procatagen stage. At the catagen stage, the ORS was separated from the IRS, and IRS disappeared. Huxley ' s layer was absent in the inactive SF while, the ORS was present in the active SF.

To investigate the effects of different parameter settings of electrical stimuli on hair growth by examining changes in human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) in vitro and by observing molecular changes in animal tissue.

In animal model, different parameter settings of AC were applied to the shaved dorsal skin of rabbit for 8 weeks. Expression of hair-related genes in the skin of rabbit was examined by RT-PCR. At low voltage power (3. 5 V) and low frequency (1 or 2 MHz) with AC, in vitro proliferation of hDPCs was successfully induced.

Humans are social animals that communicate disproportionately via potent genetic signals imbued in the skin and hair, including racial, ethnic, health, gender, and age status. For the vast majority of us, age-related hair pigment loss becomes the inescapable signal of our disappearing youth. The hair follicle (HF) pigmentary unit is a wonderful tissue for studying mechanisms generally regulating aging, often before this becomes evident elsewhere in the body. Given that follicular melanocytes (unlike those in the epidermis) are regulated by the hair growth cycle, this cycle is likely to impact the process of aging in the HF pigmentary unit. The formal identification of melanocyte stem cells in the mouse skin has spurred a flurry of reports on the potential involvement of melanocyte stem cell depletion in hair graying (i. e., canities). Caution is recommended, however, against simple extrapolation of murine data to humans. Regardless, hair graying in both species is likely to involve an age-related imbalance in the tissue ' s oxidative stress handling that will impact not only melanogenesis but also melanocyte stem cell and melanocyte homeostasis and survival. There is some emerging evidence that the HF pigmentary unit may have regenerative potential, even after it has begun to produce white hair fibers. It may therefore be feasible to develop strategies to modulate some aging-associated changes to maintain melanin production for longer.",

Female Pattern Hair Loss or female androgenetic alopecia is the main cause of hair loss in adult women and has a major impact on patients ' quality of life. It evolves from the progressive miniaturization of follicles that lead to a subsequent decrease of the hair density, leading to a non-scarring diffuse alopecia, with characteristic clinical, dermoscopic and histological patterns. In spite of the high frequency of the disease and the relevance of its psychological impact, its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood, being influenced by genetic, hormonal and environmental factors. In addition, response to treatment is variable. In this article, authors discuss the main clinical, epidemiological and pathophysiological aspects of female pattern hair loss.",

OBJECTIVES: The objective of the current study was to catalog hair shaft abnormalities in individuals with ectodermal dysplasia (ED) syndromes using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and to compare the findings with those in unaffected controls. This is the second of a two-part study, the first of which used light microscopy as the modality and was previously published. METHODS: Scanning electron microscopy was performed in a blinded manner on hair shafts from 65 subjects with seven types of ED syndromes and 41 unaffected control subjects. Assessment was performed along the length of the shaft and in cross section. SETTING: Hair donations were collected at the 28th Annual National Family Conference held by the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasia. Control subjects were recruited from a private dermatology practice and an academic children ' s hospital outpatient dermatology clinic. RESULTS: SEM identified various pathologic hair shaft abnormalities in each type of ED and in control patients. When hairs with all types of ED were grouped together and compared with those of control patients, the difference in the presence of small diameter and shallow and deep grooves was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). When the EDs were separated according to subtype, statistically significant findings were also seen. CONCLUSION: SEM is a possible adjuvant tool in the diagnosis of ED syndromes. There are significant differences, with high specificity, between the hairs of individuals with ED and those of control subjects and between subtypes.",

BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCis) has been reported to involve the hair follicle epithelium. Deep follicular invasion is often cited as a cause of treatment failure. OBJECTIVE: We sought to define the frequency and the depth of hair follicle invasion by SCCis. METHODS: The study included both a retrospective review of intraoperative pathology specimens from 42 SCCis cases treated with Mohs micrographic surgery and a prospective evaluation of serially sectioned SCCis tissue from 12 additional patients. Pathology specimens were analyzed for follicular invasion of SCCis. RESULTS: SCCis invasion of the superficial hair follicle infundibulum was observed in 61. 3% to 87. 5% of cases in the 2 cohorts, whereas invasion of the isthmus and lower follicle was observed in only 8. 3% to 12. 5% of cases. In most tumors the depth of follicular invasion was comparable with the thickness of the surrounding epidermis. The maximum observed depth of follicular invasion was 0. 82 mm. LIMITATIONS: The study was performed on a limited number of cases referred for surgery at a single institution. CONCLUSIONS: Although SCCis invasion of the upper hair follicle infundibulum is common, deep invasion below the level of the surrounding epidermis is rare. This may have implications for optimal therapy of this condition.",

    "text": "Nanocarriers for optimizing the balance between interfollicular permeation and follicular uptake of topically applied clobetasol to minimize adverse effects. The treatment of various hair disorders has become a central focus of good dermatologic patient care as it affects men and women all over the world. For many inflammatory-based scalp diseases, glucocorticoids are an essential part of treatment, even though they are known to cause systemic as well as local adverse effects when applied topically. Therefore, efficient targeting and avoidance of these side effects are of utmost importance. Optimizing the balance between drug release, interfollicular permeation, and follicular uptake may allow minimizing these adverse events and simultaneously improve drug delivery, given that one succeeds in targeting a sustained release formulation to the hair follicle. To test this hypothesis, three types of polymeric nanocarriers (nanospheres, nanocapsules, lipid-core nanocapsules) for the potent glucocorticoid clobetasol propionate (CP) were prepared. They all exhibited a sustained release of drug, as was desired. The particles were formulated as a dispersion and hydrogel and (partially) labeled with Rhodamin B for quantification purposes. Follicular uptake was investigated using the Differential Stripping method and was found highest for nanocapsules in dispersion after application of massage. Moreover, the active ingredient (CP) as well as the nanocarrier (Rhodamin B labeled polymer) recovered in the hair follicle were measured simultaneously, revealing an equivalent uptake of both. In contrast, only negligible amounts of CP could be detected in the hair follicle when applied as free drug in solution or hydrogel, regardless of any massage. Skin permeation experiments using heat-separated human epidermis mounted in Franz Diffusion cells revealed equivalent reduced transdermal permeability for all nanocarriers in comparison to application of the free drug. Combining these results, nanocapsules formulated as an aqueous dispersion and applied by massage appeare to be a good candidate to maximize follicular targeting and minimize drug penetration into the interfollicular epidermis. We conclude that such nanotechnology-based formulations provide a viable strategy for more efficient drug delivery to the hair follicle. Moreover, they present a way to minimize adverse effects of potent glucocorticoids by releasing the drug in a controlled manner and simultaneously decreasing interfollicular permeation, offering an advantage over conventional formulations for inflammatory-based skin/scalp diseases.",

Furthermore, noninvasive visualization of the sebaceous glands could offer crucial insight into the pathophysiology of follicle-related diseases and dry or seborrheic skin, in particular by combining in vivo imaging with other phenotyping, genotyping, and microbial analyses. The available imaging techniques are limited in their ability for deep tissue in vivo imaging of hair follicles and lipid-rich sebaceous glands in their entirety without biopsy. We developed a noninvasive, painless, and risk-free volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography method for deep tissue three-dimensional visualization of whole hair follicles and surrounding structures with high spatial resolution below 80 mum. Herein we demonstrate on-the-fly assessment of key morphometric parameters of follicles and lipid content as well as functional oxygenation parameters of the associated capillary bed.

Mice and human patients with impaired vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling have normal developmental hair growth but display aberrant post-morphogenic hair cycle progression associated with alopecia. In addition, VDR-/-mice exhibit impaired cutaneous wound healing. We undertook experiments to determine whether the stress-inducible regulator of energy homeostasis, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (Ddit4), is involved in these processes. By analyzing hair cycle activation in vivo, we show that VDR-/-mice at day 14 exhibit increased Ddit4 expression within follicular stress compartments. At day 29, degenerating VDR-/-follicular keratinocytes, but not bulge stem cells, continue to exhibit an increase in Ddit4 expression. At day 47, when normal follicles and epidermis are quiescent and enriched for Ddit4, VDR-/-skin lacks Ddit4 expression. In a skin wound healing assay, the re-epithelialized epidermis in wildtype (WT) but not VDR-/-animals harbor a population of Ddit4-and Krt10-positive cells. Our study suggests that VDR regulates Ddit4 expression during epidermal homeostasis and the wound healing process, while elevated Ddit4 represents an early growth-arresting stress response within VDR-/-follicles.",

INTRODUCTION: Diode lasers are often considered as the gold standard preference for hair removal due to the deep penetration and ef-fective targeting of the hair follicle. A wide variety of diode lasers are available, which can differ in terms of their parameters (such as fluence, pulse duration, repetition rate, scanner, and cooling). OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and ef cacy of hair removal with an 810 nm novel scanning diode laser, up to six months after last treatment. METHODS: A scanning 810 nm diode laser was used for axillary hair removal of 14 female patients who received 3 treatments, 4-6 weeks apart. Follow-up on hair count was conducted 3 and 6 months after last treatment and compared to baseline hair count. RESULTS: No unexpected or signi cant adverse events were recorded. An average hair count reduction of 72. 8% after 3 months and 67. 6% 6 months after the last treatment is demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: The examined 810 nm diode laser was proven to be safe and effective for hair removal. Results were sustained for 6 months after last treatment. Longer follow-up data are followed for further substantiation of the clinical effect.

Nanoemulsions have been widely applied to dermal and transdermal drug delivery. However, whether and to what depth the integral nanoemulsions can permeate into the skin is not fully understood. In this study, an environment-responsive dye, P4, was loaded into nanoemulsions to track the transdermal translocation of the nanocarriers, while coumarin-6 was embedded to represent the cargoes. Particle size has great effects on the transdermal transportation of nanoemulsions. Integral nanoemulsions with particle size of 80 nm can diffuse into but not penetrate the viable epidermis. Instead, these nanoemulsions can efficiently fill the whole hair follicle canals and reach as deep as 588 mum underneath the dermal surfaces. The cargos are released from the nanoemulsions and diffuse into the surrounding dermal tissues. On the contrary, big nanoemulsions, with mean particle size of 500 nm, cannot penetrate the stratum corneum and can only migrate along the hair follicle canals. Nanoemulsions with median size, e. g. 200 nm, show moderate transdermal permeation effects among the three-size nanoemulsions. In addition, colocalization between nanoemulsions and immunofluorescence labeled antigen-presenting cells was observed in the epidermis and the hair follicles, implying possible capture of nanoemulsions by these cells. In conclusion, nanoemulsions are advantageous for transdermal delivery and potential in transcutaneous immunization.",

Our results show that while in hair follicles the donor component was not detected in any patient, thus being a reliable source of biological material for forensic identification, mixed chimerism was detected in urine samples from all patient, and no correlation was found between the time elapsed from the transplant and the percentage of chimerism. These results certainly have practical implications if the urine is being considered as a source of DNA for identification purposes in HSTC patients. Moreover, taking into consideration that chimerism was found not only in patients with leukocyturia (given the hematopoietic origin of leukocytes, this was expected), but also in those without observable leukocytes in the sediment, we conclude that an alternative source or sources of donor DNA must be implicated.",

Genotoxicity-induced hair loss from chemotherapy and radiotherapy is often encountered in cancer treatment, and there is a lack of effective treatment. In growing hair follicles (HF), quiescent stem cells (SC) are maintained in the bulge region, and hair bulbs at the base contain rapidly dividing, yet genotoxicity-sensitive transit-amplifying cells (TAC) that maintain hair growth. How genotoxicity-induced HF injury is repaired remains unclear. We report here that HFs mobilize ectopic progenitors from distinct TAC compartments for regeneration in adaptation to the severity of dystrophy induced by ionizing radiation (IR). Specifically, after low-dose IR, keratin 5 + basal hair bulb progenitors, rather than bulge SCs, were quickly activated to replenish matrix cells and regenerated all concentric layers of HFs, demonstrating their plasticity. After high-dose IR, when both matrix and hair bulb cells were depleted, the surviving outer root sheath cells rapidly acquired an SC-like state and fueled HF regeneration. Their progeny then homed back to SC niche and supported new cycles of HF growth. We also revealed that IR induced HF dystrophy and hair loss and suppressed WNT signaling in a p53-and dose-dependent manner. Augmenting WNT signaling attenuated the suppressive effect of p53 and enhanced ectopic progenitor proliferation after genotoxic injury, thereby preventing both IR-and cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia. Hence, targeted activation of TAC-derived progenitor cells, rather than quiescent bulge SCs, for anagen HF repair can be a potential approach to prevent hair loss from chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Microneedling is a minimally invasive dermatological procedure in which fine needles are rolled over the skin to puncture the stratum corneum. This therapy is used to induce collagen formation, neovascularization and growth factor production of treated areas. It has been used in a wide range of dermatologic conditions, including androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and alopecia areata, among others. While there are a limited number of studies examining this therapy in the use of hair loss, microneedling has been successfully paired with other hair growth promoting therapies, such as minoxidil, platelet-rich plasma and topical steroids, and shown to stimulate hair follicle growth. It is thought that microneedling facilitates penetration of such first-line medications, and this is one mechanism by which it promotes hair growth. To date, the area most studied and with the most success has been microneedling treatment of AGA. While the current evidence does not allow one to conclude superiority of microneedling over existing standard therapies for hair loss, microneedling shows some promise in improving hair growth, especially in combination with existing techniques.

Barrier function of hair follicles (HFs) is of great interest because they might be an entry port for allergens/pathogens, but could on the other hand be used for drug delivery or vaccination.

We show that there is a TJ barrier in the outermost living layer bordering to the environment from the infundibulum to the lower central part and between Henle ' s and Huxles layer of anagen HFs. In club hair typical for catagen and telogen HFs a TJ barrier is found surrounding the club. This demonstrates that there is a continuous TJ barrier along interfollicular epidermis and HFs in different phases of HF cycle. However, interestingly, in cell culture experiments we can show that barrier is less tight in HF keratinocytes compared to interfollicular keratinocytes. Knock-down of the TJ protein claudin-1, which we demonstrate here to be less expressed in HFs of lesional atopic dermatitis skin, results in impaired barrier function, decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of hair keratinocytes.

Purpose: To describe and evaluate the eyelash transplantation with strip composite eyebrow graft to improve eyelid anatomy in tarsoconjunctival flap eyelid reconstruction procedure. Methods: Twenty two patients with eyelid tumors managed by local excision and reconstruction using tarsoconjunctival flap reconstruction procedure were included. Eyelash graft was performed during flap division by harvesting a graft from the eyebrow and creating a recipient pocket in the receptor eyelid. Patients had a 1-year follow up. Eyelash orientation and follicle survival rate were recorded. Demographic variables were analyzed with descriptive statistics. For eyelash follicles survival rate assessment, we evaluated the number of follicles found in the first postoperative day with the follicles found at the end of the study using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Humans differ in many respects from other primates, but perhaps no derived human feature is more striking than our naked skin. Long purported to be adaptive, humans ' unique external appearance is characterized by changes in both the patterning of hair follicles and eccrine sweat glands, producing decreased hair cover and increased sweat gland density. Despite the conspicuousness of these features and their potential evolutionary importance, there is a lack of clarity regarding how they evolved within the primate lineage. We thus collected and quantified the density of hair follicles and eccrine sweat glands from five regions of the skin in three species of primates: macaque, chimpanzee and human. Although human hair cover is greatly attenuated relative to that of our close relatives, we find that humans have a chimpanzee-like hair density that is significantly lower than that of macaques. In contrast, eccrine gland density is on average 10-fold higher in humans compared to chimpanzees and macaques, whose density is strikingly similar. Our findings suggest that a decrease in hair density in the ancestors of humans and apes was followed by an increase in eccrine gland density and a reduction in fur cover in humans. This work answers long-standing questions about the traits that make human skin unique and substantiates a model in which the evolution of expanded eccrine gland density was exclusive to the human lineage.",

A high and thick dermis without adipocytes was observed. Hair follicles and sebaceous and sweat glands were located in the proximal part of the skin while a thick layer of connective tissue, lacking adipose cells, separated these structures by subcutis. RT-PCR evidenced the transcripts for both molecules. By immunohistochemistry, Lep and LepR were observed in the epidermis and hair follicles. Based on the absence of intradermal adipose tissue and the presence of both Lep and LepR in the epidermis and in the hair follicle epithelium, it can be posited that in bovine skin Lep participates to the control of epidermis growth and hair follicle cycle through a paracrine and autocrine mechanisms.",

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a dimeric glycoprotein that induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells as well as regulation of capillary formation around hair follicles which affects the growth and development of hair follicles. cgVEGF164 is a major splice variant of the cashmere goat VEGF-A gene, but its regulation on hair follicles is rarely known. In order to investigate the role of cgVEGF164 on the growth of murine hair follicles, we produced keratin 14 promoter-driven cgVEGF164 transgenic mice via pronuclear microinjection. Firstly, the diameter and density of hair follicles of transgenic mice were compared with non-transgenic control mice in paraffin sections stained by hematoxylin-eosin (H & E). Then, protein expression levels and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT1 and LEF1 were examined by Western blot. There are five positive individuals among the neonatal mice (positive rate is 8. 5%). Compared with non-transgenic control mice, the diameter and density of hair follicles in transgenic mice are both obviously increased. The expression levels of P-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, P-AKT1/AKT1 and P-LEF1/LEF1 are significantly higher in transgenic mice than those in non-transgenic control mice. Based on these results, we conclude that cgVEGF164 as a growth factor can improve the growth of hair follicles which might be mediated by increasing the levels of ERK1/2, AKT1, and LEF1 protein phosphorylation.",

Background: Hypopigmented macules are seen in a variety of disorders and the diagnosis rests on clinicopathological correlation. However, some cases are difficult to classify and pose a diagnostic challenge. Aim: To describe the clinical and histopathological features of patients with hypopigmented macules and follicular spongiosis on histopathology. Materials and Methods: We undertook a retrospective analysis of clinical and histopathological findings in 12 patients who presented with clinically nondiagnostic hypopigmented macules and showed follicular spongiosis on skin biopsy, at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India between January 2015 and October 2016. The findings were compared with 12 patients with \" \" unclassified \" \" hypopigmented macules, who did not show follicular spongiosis on skin biopsy. Results: A total of 12 patients with hypopigmented macules showed spongiosis affecting the follicular epithelium on histopathology. There were eight men and four women, most in their second decade (mean age 19. 1 +-8. 05 years), presenting with hypopigmented macules most commonly on the upper limbs, for a mean duration of 6. 33 +-5. 10 months. Clinically evident lesional hair loss was seen in all patients, and follicular prominences in seven (58%) patients. Histological features suggestive of other diagnosis, namely leprosy, mycosis fungoides or sarcoidosis were not seen in any biopsy. Alcian blue stain revealed an minimal amount of mucin in one biopsy. Clinically apparent hair loss and follicular prominences were found to be statistically significantly associated with histological evidence of follicular spongiosis (P < 0. 001 and 0. 003, respectively). Limitations: Our study is limited by its retrospective design and small sample size. Conclusions: Patients with hypopigmented macules and follicular spongiosis on histopathology may represent a distinct clinicopathological entity that is associated with lesional hair loss and follicular prominences. It is probably a variant of an endogenous dermatitis similar to pityriasis alba. \"",

(Asteraceae) (EP) has been widely used for the treatment of skin disease in Asian traditional medicine. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the potency of EP in promoting hair growth in vivo and in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6N mice were divided into four groups (n = 4) as follows: control (topical treatment of normal saline), topical 3% minoxidil to the dorsal skin of mice for 14 days, and low (1 mg/day) and high (10 mg/day) doses of EP orally administered once a day for 14 days. Dorsal hairs of C57BL/6N mice were depilated to synchronize anagen induction. Hair growth activity was evaluated by gross and microscopic observations. Sections of dorsal skin were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. We also treated the various concentrations of EP (5, 10 and 50 mug/mL) for 24 h on the human dermal papilla cells (HDPs) and examined the effects of EP on the expression of FGF-7 and mTOR signalling. RESULTS: EP enhanced the induction of anagen in the dorsal skin of mice, characterized by the appearance of inner root sheath along with hair shaft, the emergence of hair shaft through the epidermis. EP increased the expression of FGF-7, while decreased the level of FGF-5 in C57/BL6 mice. EP also increased the expression of FGF-7, activated the mTOR signalling in HDPs. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that EP has a potency to enhance the growth of hair follicle, promoting hair growth through regulation of FGF-7 and FGF-5.",

The role of innate immunocytes such as mast cells, gammadelta T cells, NK cells and macrophages (MACs) in hair growth control under physiological and pathological conditions has recently begun to be re-explored. Here, we revisit the role of resident perifollicular macrophages (pfMACs) located in the hair follicle (HF) mesenchyme (CTS). Substantial, stringently timed fluctuations in the number and localization of pfMACs were first observed long ago during murine HF morphogenesis and cycling. This already suggested some involvement of these innate immunocytes, with a recognized role in tissue remodelling and in hair growth control. The relatively recent demonstration of a Wnt signalling-driven crosstalk between these immunocytes and HF epithelial stem cells in telogen HFs, which promotes anagen induction, has reinvigorated interest in the role that pfMAC plays in hair biology. Besides the apoptosis-associated secretion of stem cell-activating Wnts and the differential secretion of HF-targeting growth factors such as FGF-5 and FGF5s from pfMACs, we also explore how MAC polarization, and thus function, may be influenced by the local metabolic and immune environment. Moreover, we examine how pfMACs may contribute to hair cycle-associated angiogenesis, vascular remodelling, HF immune privilege and immunopathology. On this basis, we discuss why targeting pfMACs may be relevant in the management of hair growth disorders. Finally, we argue that studying pfMACs offers an excellent, clinically relevant model system for characterizing and experimentally manipulating MAC interactions with an easily accessible mammalian, continuously remodelled (mini-) organ under both physiological and pathological conditions.",

Tissue homeostasis requires the balance of growth by cell production and regression through cell loss. In the hair cycle, during follicle regression, the niche traverses the skin through an unknown mechanism to reach the stem cell reservoir and trigger new growth. Here, we identify the dermal sheath that lines the follicle as the key driver of tissue regression and niche relocation through the smooth muscle contractile machinery that generates centripetal constriction force. We reveal that the calcium-calmodulin-myosin light chain kinase pathway controls sheath contraction. When this pathway is blocked, sheath contraction is inhibited, impeding follicle regression and niche relocation. Thus, our study identifies the dermal sheath as smooth muscle that drives follicle regression for reuniting niche and stem cells in order to regenerate tissue structure during homeostasis.",

One limitation of HPF is the small sample volume of < 200 microm thickness and about 2000 microm across. A wool follicle is a rare intact organ in a single sample about 200 microm thick. Within each follicle, specialized cells derived from multiple cell lineages assemble, mature and cornify to make a wool fibre, which contains 95% keratin and associated proteins. In addition to their complex structure, large density changes occur during wool fibre development. Limited water movement and accessibility of fixatives are some issues that negatively affect the preservation of the follicle ultrastructure via conventional chemical processing.

BACKGROUND: Human hair is highly responsive to stress, and human scalp hair follicles (HFs) contain a peripheral neuroendocrine equivalent of the systemic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is supposed to be aggravated by stress. We used corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which triggers the HPA axis, to induce a stress response in human ex vivo male AGA HFs. Caffeine is known to reverse testosterone-mediated hair growth inhibition in the same hair organ culture model. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether caffeine would antagonize CRH-mediated stress in these HFs. METHODS: HFs from balding vertex area scalp biopsies of men affected by AGA were incubated with CRH (10-7 mol L-1) with or without caffeine (0 001% or 0 005%). RESULTS: Compared to controls, CRH significantly enhanced the expression of catagen-inducing transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta2) (P < 0 001), CRH receptors 1 and 2 (CRH-R1/2) (P < 0 01), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (P < 0 001) and melanocortin receptor 2 (MC-R2) (P < 0 001), and additional stress-associated parameters, substance P and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). CRH inhibited matrix keratinocyte proliferation and expression of anagen-promoting insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and the pro-proliferative nerve growth factor receptor NGF-tyrosine kinase receptor A (TrkA). Caffeine significantly counteracted all described stress effects and additionally enhanced inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3-R), for the first time detected in human HFs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first evidence in ex vivo human AGA HFs that the stress mediator CRH induces not only a complex intrafollicular HPA response, but also a non-HPA-related stress response. Moreover, we show that these effects can be effectively antagonized by caffeine. Thus, these data strongly support the hypothesis that stress can impair human hair physiology and induce hair loss, and that caffeine may effectively counteract stress-induced hair damage and possibly prevent stress-induced hair loss.",

In this study, we focus on providing a better understanding of HFs in general and how they behave in vitro. The first part of the review presents skin morphology with an emphasis on HFs and hair loss. The remainder of the paper evaluates cells, materials, and methods of in vitro growth of HFs. Lastly, in vitro models and assays for evaluating the effects of active compounds on alopecia and hair growth are presented, with the final emphasis on applications of in vitro HFs in hair transplantation.

BACKGROUND: Eyelashes play an important role in the perception of beauty and protection of eyeballs. The outcome of eyelash restoration varies and mainly depends on the surgeon ' s technique and no standard procedure exists. AIMS: To evaluate the effect of modified single-hair follicular unit grafting to esthetically restore eyelashes and provide a potential alternative of standard procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 34 patients with sparse or partially absent eyelashes who underwent modified procedure were included. Single-hair grafts were harvested from the donor site (post-auricular, nape, frontal hairline area). Grafts were transplanted with 23 gauge needle and fine forceps in the modified procedure. The patients were followed for a mean of 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: All patients were satisfied with the result 12 months after the surgery. An average of 46. 5 grafts (34-68) were transplanted in each upper eyelid. The mean graft survival rate after 1 year was 87. 2% (84%-92%). Of the 34 patients, three patients received a second session to achieve a denser appearance. No significant complication as trichiasis, infection, scarring, or eyeball injury occurred. CONCLUSION: This modified single-hair follicular unit grafting is a good alternative for esthetic eyelash restoration with good cosmetic results, relative easy maintenance, lack of complications, and long-term patient satisfaction.",

BACKGROUND: Paradoxical hypertrichosis (PH) is an uncommon, poorly understood adverse effect associated with laser or intense pulsed light treatment for hair removal. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine PH prevalence and associated risk factors. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating hair removal with lasers or intense pulsed light. Primary outcome was PH prevalence. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were used to investigate associations among treatment modality, patients ' characteristics, and PH. RESULTS: Included were 9733 patients in two randomized controlled trials and 20 cohort studies (three prospective and 17 retrospective). Pooled PH prevalence was 3% (95% confidence interval 1-6 ; I2 = 97%). Paradoxical hypertrichosis was associated with a face or neck anatomic location, and occurred in only 0. 08% of non-facial/neck cases. Treatment modality and interval between treatments had no effect on the PH rate. There were insufficient data to determine the association between sex and skin type to PH. In three out of four studies, PH gradually improved with continued therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Based primarily on cohort studies, PH occurs in 3% of patients undergoing hair removal with lasers or intense pulsed light, yet rarely outside the facial/neck areas. Treatment modality does not seem to be a contributing factor. Continuation of treatment in areas with PH may be the most appropriate treatment.",

The Yangtze River Delta white goat is a unique goat species that can produce superior-quality brush hair. The formation of this brush hair is controlled by a series of critical genes and related signaling pathways. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), are ubiquitous endogenous non-coding RNAs that regulate many biological and physiological processes in mammals. However, little is known about the potential regulatory role of circRNAs on superior-quality brush hair formation in Yangtze River Delta white goat. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to only detect circRNAs in the neck skin tissue of normal-quality goats (NHQs) and superior-quality goats (HQs). A total of 61 803 circRNAs were identified and 32 of them were differentially expressed in the NHQ group vs. the HQ group. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the source gene of differentially expressed circRNAs (DE-circRNAs) was enriched mostly in platelet activation and the focal adhesion signal pathway. Action mechanism analysis revealed that DE-circRNAs could sponge to many identified miRNAs, including miR-31, miR-125b, miR-let-7a and miR-149-5p, which have important roles in goat hair follicle stem cell growth, hair follicle development and morphogenesis. Altogether, our findings provide a valuable basis for studying circRNAs involved in superior-quality brush hair traits and meanwhile advance our understanding of circRNA complex regulation mechanisms in Yangtze River Delta white goat skin hair follicle development.",

BACKGROUND: Eccrine sweat glands (ESGs) and hair follicles (HFs) are the prominent skin appendages regulating human body temperature. C57BL/6 mice and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats are the most commonly used model animals for studying ESGs and HFs. Previous studies have shown the distribution of ESGs and HFs in volar hindfeet of C57BL/6 mice, but there are few or no reports on the distribution of ESGs and HFs in volar forefeet of C57BL/6 mice and volar feet of SD rats. Here, we investigated the differential distribution and genetic determination of ESGs and HFs in the volar skin of C57BL/6 mice and SD rats through gross observation, iodine-starch sweat test, double staining with Nile Blue A and Oil Red O, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, double immunofluorescence staining of LIM Homeobox 2 (LHX2)/Na +-K +-ATPase alpha1 (NKA) or LHX2/Na +-K +-2Cl-cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), and qRT-PCR detection of ESG-related gene Engrailed 1 (En1) and HF-related gene LHX2. RESULTS: The results showed ESGs but no HFs in the footpads of C57BL/6 mice and SD rats, both ESGs and HFs in the inter-footpads (IFPs) of C57BL/6 mice, and neither ESGs nor HFs in the IFPs of SD rats. The relative quantitative change in En1 was consistent with the differential distribution of ESGs, and the relative quantitative change of LHX2 was consistent with the differential distribution of HFs. CONCLUSION: C57BL/6 mice and SD rats had their own characteristics in the distribution of ESGs and HFs in the volar skin, and researchers should choose mice or rats, and even forefeet or hindfeet as their research object according to different purposes. The study provides a basis for selection of optimal animal models to study development, wound healing and regeneration of skin appendages.",

We identified a cadherin family member, desmoglein 4, which is expressed in the suprabasal epidermis and hair follicle. The essential role of desmoglein 4 in skin was established by identifying mutations in families with inherited hypotrichosis, as well as in the lanceolate hair mouse. We also show that DSG4 is an autoantigen in pemphigus vulgaris. Characterization of the phenotype of naturally occurring mutant mice revealed disruption of desmosomal adhesion and perturbations in keratinocyte behavior.

Using different markers, we were able to identify two distinct epithelial stem cell reservoirs, located in the upper and lower thirds of the anagen hair follicle outer root sheath. These two reservoirs fuse during the regression phase and individualize again in the new forming anagen hair follicle. Using a set of antibodies specific of melanocyte lineage and melanogenesis, pigmentation unit turnover was followed throughout the entire hair cycle. In the terminal anagen hair, active melanocytes were localized on top of the dermal papilla, while amelanotic melanocytes were identified in the upper third of the outer root sheath (ORS). Those amelanotic melanocytes located in upper ORS probably represented a melanocyte reservoir for successive hair generation, since at the induction of anagen phase, some melanocytes were committed to cell division and melanogenesis was turned on, but only in the nascent hair bulb, close to the dermal papilla.",

    "text": "Effect of minoxidil on proliferation and apoptosis in dermal papilla cells of human hair follicle. BACKGROUND: Minoxidil has been widely used to treat androgenetic alopecia, but little is known about its pharmacological activity or about the identity of its target cells in hair follicles. We hypothesized that minoxidil has direct effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) of human hair follicle. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the mechanism of topical minoxidil action in terms of stimulating hair growth. METHODS: We evaluated cell proliferations in cultured DPCs by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and measured the expressions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt, Bcl-2, and Bax by Western blot. We also measured elongation of hair follicles in organ culture. RESULTS: Minoxidil significantly increased the proliferation of DPCs. The levels of ERK phosphorylation and of phosphorylated Akt increased significantly 1 h post-treatment ; percentage increase of ERK phosphorylation was 287% at 0. 1 microM and 351% at 1. 0 microM of minoxidil, and that of Akt phosphorylation was 168% at 0. 1 microM and 257% at 1. 0 microM of minoxidil. 1. 0 microM of minoxidil increased Bcl-2 expression over 150%, while 1. 0 microM of minoxidil decreased Bax expression by more than 50%. Moreover, a significant elongation of individual hair follicles in organ culture was observed after adding minoxidil. CONCLUSION: Minoxidil promotes the survival of human DPCs by activating both ERK and Akt and by preventing cell death by increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. We suggest that minoxidil stimulates the growth of human hairs by prolonging anagen through these proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on DPCs.",

The terminal differentiation (TD) program of keratinocytes of the human hair follicle (HF) occurs with specific temporal and spatial features in the various layers of the inner root sheath (IRS) and in the innermost layer of the outer root sheath (companion layer). This process is characterized by complex nuclear and cytoplasmic morphological changes, accompanied by profound modifications in intercellular junctions. As no correlation exists between the structure and the molecular composition of desmosomes during TD of the IRS/companion unit, the aim of our study was to investigate by transmission electron microscopy the remodeling of desmosomes in keratinizing cells of these compartments. By immunogold post embedding technique, we studied in anagen HFs the modulation of the synthesis of desmocollin 1 (Dsc1), a transmembrane glycoprotein specifically synthesized in the IRS and in the companion layer. Dsc1 immunoreactivity was actually confined to these compartments and tended to increase just before the level of TD, particularly in the Henle ' s layer and in the IRS cuticle.

In the whole IRS, concomitantly with TD, there was an abrupt and almost complete disappearance of Dsc1 synthesis. An asymmetric distribution of Dsc1 was noticed (i) between cells at different stages of differentiation and (ii) between cells belonging to layers with different spatial/temporal features of TD.

In general concurrence with recent studies, bioinformatic analysis of the chromosome 17q21. 2 DNA sequence found in the EBI/Genebank database shows the presence of 27 type I keratin genes and five keratin pseudogenes present on 8 contiguous Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) sequences. This constitutes the 970 kb type I keratin gene domain. Inserted into this domain is a 350 kb region harboring 32 previously characterized keratin-associated protein genes. Of the 27 keratin genes found in this region, six have not been characterized in detail. This study reports the isolation of cDNA sequences for these keratin genes, termed K25irs1-K25irs4, Ka35, and Ka36, as well as cDNA sequences for the previously reported hair keratins hHa3-I, hHa7, and hHa8. RT-PCR analysis of 14 epithelial tissues using primers for the six novel keratins, as well as for keratins 23 and 24, shows that the six novel keratins appear to be hair follicle associated. Previous expression data, coupled with evolutionary analysis studies point to K25irs1-K25irs4 probably being inner root sheath specific keratins. Ka35 and Ka36 are, based on their exon-intron structure and expression characteristics, hair keratins. In contrast, K23 and K24 appear to be epithelial keratins associated with simple/glandular or stratified, non-cornified epithelia, respectively. A literature analysis coupled with the data presented here confirms that all of the 27 keratin genes found on this domain have been characterized at the transcriptional level.

    "text": "Aberrantly differentiated cells in benign pilomatrixoma reflect the normal hair follicle: immunohistochemical analysis of Ca-binding S100A2, S100A3 and S100A6 proteins. BACKGROUND: Pilomatrixoma is a common benign cutaneous tumour containing differentiated hair matrix cells. This tumour is mainly composed of basophilic, transitional, shadow and squamoid cells. Although some S100 proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific manner in the hair follicle (e. g. S100A2 in the outer root sheath, S100A3 in the cortex and cuticle, and S100A6 in the inner root sheath), little information is available concerning their distribution in the aberrantly differentiated tissues of pilomatrixoma. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the disordered epithelial elements of pilomatrixoma by localizing S100A2, S100A3 and S100A6 proteins. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and dual-immunofluorescence microscopy were performed on 22 pilomatrixoma specimens using antibodies specific to the three proteins. RESULTS: Tissue-specific distribution of the S100 proteins investigated was preserved in the morphologically disordered tumour tissues. Anti-S100A2 antibody stained squamoid cells and putative outer root sheath cells ; basophilic and potential hair matrix cells were occasionally stained. S100A3 staining was found in transitional cells and putative cortical cells, and was strong in both dispersed cells and hair-like structures surrounding cells which were presumably cuticular cells. Anti-S100A6 antibody labelled some S100A3-negative transitional cell strands, potentially inner root sheath cells. CONCLUSIONS: The epithelial elements of pilomatrixoma can be characterized using S100 proteins as biochemical markers. Our results show that pilomatrixomas retain a certain degree of differentiation indicative of distinct hair-forming cells.",

Serotonin (5-HT) has been a candidate for neurotransmitters in cutaneous type I mechanoreceptors (i. e., Merkel cell-nerve endings). Although recent electrophysiological studies have suggested the presence of the 5-HT2 and 3 receptors in the Merkel cell-nerve endings, the histological localization of these receptors are obscure. We thus immunohistochemically examined the presence of 5-HT1, 2, 3 receptors in Merkel cell-nerve endings in sinus hair follicles of the rat whisker pad. We also studied the immunohistochemical localization of the 5-HT transporter to confirm the site of 5-HT secretion. For this purpose, we used antibodies for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT3 receptors, and for the 5-HT transporter, as well as antibodies for cytokeratin 20 (as a marker of Merkel cells) and neurofilament H (a marker of type I sensory nerve terminals). The immuno-stained sections were analyzed under a laser-scanning microscope. It was found that the sensory nerve terminals in the Merkel cell-nerve endings showed strong positive immunoreactions of 5-HT1A and 1B receptors but not 5-HT2A, 2C, and 3 receptors. Furthermore, both the Merkel cells and related axon terminals showed strong immunoreactions of the 5-HT transporter. These findings support the idea that 5-HT molecules are released from the Merkel cells during mechanical reception and indirectly regulate neural actions of sensory neurons via 5-HT1 receptors. The localization of the 5-HT transporter found in this study also suggests a possibility that axon terminals in the Merkel cell-nerve endings also release 5-HT.",

It is a given fact that hair follicles play an important role in the penetration process of topically applied drugs and cosmetics. Since exact knowledge of the potential follicular reservoir is essential for understanding and calculating the penetration process, this knowledge may indeed help to optimize the development of topically applied drugs and cosmetic products. We know that variability in skin properties exists among the human population, but it is the deciphering and quantification of these differences that may help to explain racial disparities in dermatological disorders and provide a basic approach for treatment and prevention. Data pertaining to structural and functional differences within ethnic skin types (reviewed in this paper) support the assumption that hair follicles in the various skin types are not equal. Thus, the need to investigate follicular morphology in non-Caucasian skin types becomes more than apparent. The aim of the present study was to determine the potential reservoir of vellus hair follicles in non-Caucasian skin types in order to estimate their contribution to the penetration of topically applied substances. Cyanoacrylate skin surface biopsies were taken from seven body sites of Asians and African-Americans. To determine the follicular reservoir, the samples were evaluated under the light microscope. Follicular parameters were measured with the help of a digital imaging software program. In the evaluation and comparison of the results with those of Caucasians, significant differences were detected. Compared with Whites, follicular density on the forehead is significantly lower in Asians and African-Americans. Smaller values were detected for volume, surface, follicular orifice and hair shaft diameter on the thigh and in calf regions in Asians and African-Americans. Furthermore, the follicular reservoir, characterized by follicular volume, is generally higher in Caucasians. In comparison to African-Americans, larger follicular volumes on the forehead, back and on the upper arm were determined in Asians. The fairly similar density in these sites revealed that Asians have a higher follicular reservoir in these sites. Due to significant ethnic differences in the follicular reservoir, particularly on the calf and forehead, prospective skin absorption experiments need to be performed on different skin types in order to be representative. Likewise, the development of topically applied drugs should take place under adequate consideration of ethnic differences in skin physiology.",

Dermal papilla (DP) at the hair follicle base is important for hair growth. Recent studies demonstrated that mouse vibrissa DP cells can be cultured in the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), but lose expression of versican and their follicle-inducing activity during the culture, and that activation of the Wnt signal, which is inhibited by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), in the DP cells promotes hair growth activity. We therefore investigated the influence of a GSK-3 inhibitor, (2 ' Z, 3 ' E)-6-bromoindirubin-3 '-oxime (BIO), on the growth of human DP cells and mouse vibrissa follicles in culture. We first demonstrated that, similarly to mouse DP cells, human DP cells were able to be cultured up to 15 passages in the presence of FGF-2, and lost the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). When human DP cells later than ten passages were treated with BIO, the expression of ALP as well as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), another DP marker, was significantly elevated. Nuclear and perinuclear translocation of beta-catenin was also observed. We then cultured mouse vibrissa follicles. In the presence of BIO, the follicles could be maintained for at least 3 days without detectable regression of the hair bulbs. The morphology and ALP expression were well preserved. BIO successfully retrieved the expression of DP marker molecules, such as ALP and IGF-1 in cultured human DP cells, and maintained mouse hair bulbs.

BACKGROUND: A handpiece with a 35 x 22-mm treatment window that uses vacuum technology has been designed for the diode laser system. Vacuum suction stretches the skin and brings the hair follicle closer to the surface with the intent to damage the hair follicle at a lower surface fluence. The objective of this study was to compare the degree of follicular thermal damage between the sapphire-cooled smaller handpiece at a higher fluence versus the larger vacuum-assisted handpiece at a lower fluence. METHODS: Five male patients with Fitzpatrick skin types I-IV were enrolled in the study. Three test spots on the right back were treated with the vacuum-assisted laser handpiece at a setting of 10-12 J/cm2, and 61-ms pulse duration. Three test spots on the left back were treated with the sapphire-cooled handpiece with a setting of 30-34 J/cm2 and a pulse duration of 14-16 ms. A punch biopsy was obtained from one treated area for each handpiece type. The biopsies were sectioned horizontally and examined for the degree of thermal damage to the hair follicle at the level of the isthmus and the bulb. Immediate treatment response, pain score, and total treatment time were recorded. RESULTS: Biopsies from the skin treated with the sapphire-cooled handpiece and the vacuum-assisted handpiece showed the mean hair follicle diameter was 258. 3 microm (SE [standard error] 41. 7) and 225. 1 microm (SE 17. 1), respectively. The mean thermal damage diameter to hair diameter ratio was 0. 91 (SE 0. 10) and 0. 72 (SE 0. 12), respectively. The mean immediate treatment response, the mean pain severity, and the mean total treatment time were all lower for the vacuum-assisted handpiece. CONCLUSION: Treatment with the vacuum-assisted handpiece is faster and has a tendency to be more comfortable. Thermal damage to the hair follicle was greater with the sapphire-cooled handpiece.",

A recent trend in stable isotopic analysis involves the reconstruction of short-term variations in diet using hair segments. However, bulk hair samples typically contain a growth cycle error, which may conceal or confound the most recently incorporated isotopic information. It is assumed that, at any given time, ~ 85-90% of scalp hairs are actively growing, while the remaining 10-15% have transitioned into a resting or inactive phase, which lasts up to 4 months before hairs are shed. This study uses growth phase to determine the effects of age, sex, and health status on carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios of hair analyzed in sequential segments. For this study, we selected archaeological hair samples from 10 individuals from Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt. Isotopic analyses of actively growing hair segments were compared to those for mixed growth phase segments from each individual. These data demonstrate the presence of growth cycle error and show that an understanding of structural-functional relationships is essential for interpreting normal versus pathological changes in hair follicle and fiber production. In situations where diet change and mobility produce variations in an individual ' s isotopic composition, elimination of positional-temporal error in sequential segment hair analyses can facilitate greater understanding of intraindividual metabolic reactions and changes in hair growth cycles. Phase identification may aid in determining the presence of pathological conditions in individuals, especially in those lacking skeletal indications, and provide a more precise estimation of seasonal dietary patterns, access to changing food resources, and metabolic equilibration to a new locality.",

Here, we identified Wnt signaling as a key pathway that couples the behavior of the two stem cells. EpSCs and McSCs coordinately activate Wnt signaling at the onset of hair follicle regeneration within the sHG. Using genetic mouse models that specifically target either EpSCs or McSCs, we show that Wnt activation in McSCs drives their differentiation into pigment-producing melanocytes, while EpSC Wnt signaling not only dictates hair follicle formation but also regulates McSC proliferation during hair regeneration. Our data define a role for Wnt signaling in the regulation of McSCs and also illustrate a mechanism for regeneration of complex organs through collaboration between heterotypic stem cell populations.",

Genes involved in the planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling pathway, which is capable of polarizing cells within the planar plane of an epithelium, can control the orientation and differentiation of hair follicles, underlining their involvement in skin pattern formation. Here, we summarize recent progress that has been made to understand the PCP signalling pathway and its function in mammalian skin, including its role in hair follicle morphogenesis, ciliogenesis and wound healing.

Hair follicle and fibre characteristics of Peruvian alpaca and llama and Bolivian llama were analysed in three experimental studies. The first experiment was designed to determine the age at which all the secondary follicles reach maturity, as well as to compare the skin follicular structure and activity among these different types of Peruvian camelids. It is concluded that the South American camelids investigated in this study gained a complete and mature skin follicle apparatus at an early age, and hence producers should practise an early first shearing. A second Peruvian experiment investigated comparative fibre cuticular structure on twenty Peruvian domestic camelids comprising huacaya, suri and llama (woolly) ' chacos ' genotypes. The results showed that the number of cuticular scales per 100 mum fibre length proved to be strongly affected by both the fleece type and the fibre diameter. The suri fleece was clearly differentiated from those of both huacaya and llama by possessing the highest percentage of fibres with a number of scales less than eight, the lowest percentage of fibres with more than nine scales, along with the lowest percentage of fibres with a diameter of more than 35 mum. It is concluded that, with the exception of the scale height, the cuticular parameters investigated in this study can be utilised in textile fibre analyses for distinguishing among these three types of fleece, as well as in selection projects designed to produce homogeneous fibres from Peruvian domestic camelids. A further study was conducted to determine the age at which the hair follicles in Bolivian llamas reach maturity as well as for comparing the skin follicular structure and activity between the two distinct genotypes. Thirty-one llama kids were chosen. They were born between January and April 1998 and were of different sex and of ' Q ' aras ' (or Carguera) or ' T ' amphullis ' type. Skin biopsies were taken from the right mid-costal region at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 months of age in order to monitor four follicular parameters. In this experiment, secondary to primary (S/P) data show that the Bolivian llama population analysed possessed a complete and mature skin follicle apparatus at birth that remained essentially constant throughout the investigation period.

P-cadherin is a key component of epithelial adherens junctions, and it is prominently expressed in the hair follicle (HF) matrix. Loss-of-function mutations in CDH3, which encodes P-cadherin, result in hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD), an autosomal recessive disorder featuring sparse and short hair. Here, we attempted to recapitulate some aspects of HJMD in vitro by transfecting normal, organ-cultured human scalp HFs with lipofectamine and CDH3-specific or scrambled control siRNAs. As in HJMD patients, P-cadherin silencing inhibited hair shaft growth, prematurely induced HF regression (catagen), and inhibited hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation. In situ, membrane beta-catenin expression and transcription of the beta-catenin target gene, axin2, were significantly reduced, whereas glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) and phospho-beta-catenin immunoreactivity were increased. These effects were partially reversed by inhibiting GSK3beta. P-cadherin silencing reduced the expression of the anagen-promoting growth factor, IGF-1, whereas that of transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFbeta2 ; catagen promoter) was enhanced. Neutralizing TGFbeta antagonized the catagen-promoting effects of P-cadherin silencing. In summary, we introduce human HFs as an attractive preclinical model for studying the functions of P-cadherin in human epithelial biology and pathology. This model demonstrates that cadherins can be successfully knocked down in an intact human organ in vitro, and shows that P-cadherin is needed for anagen maintenance by regulating canonical Wnt signaling and suppressing TGFbeta2.",

The expression pattern of involucrin in human scalp skin and hair follicle cycle stages is not fully explored. This study addresses this issue and tests the hypothesis that \" \" the expression of involucrin undergoes hair follicle cycle-dependent changes \" \". A total of 50 normal human scalp skin biopsies were examined (healthy females, 51-62 years) using immunofluorescence staining methods and real-time PCR analysis. In each case, 50 hair follicles were analyzed (35, 10 and 5 follicles in anagen, catagen and telogen, respectively). Involucrin was prominently expressed in the human scalp skin and hair follicles, on both gene and protein levels. The protein expression showed hair follicle cycle-associated changes i. e. a very strong expression during early and mature anagen, intermediate to strong expression during catagen and prominent decline in the telogen phase. The expression value of involucrin in both anagen and catagen was statistically significantly higher than that of telogen hair follicles (p < 0. 001). This study provides the first morphologic indication that involucrin is differentially expressed in the human scalp skin and hair follicles and reports that involucrin expression pattern undergoes hair cycle-dependent changes. The clinical ramifications of these findings are open for further investigations. \"",

Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) have the potential to induce differentiation of epithelial stem cells into hair, and Wnt signaling is deeply involved in the initiation process. The functional limitation of expanded adult DPCs has been a difficult challenge for cell-based hair regrowth therapy. We previously reported that 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D (3) (VD (3)) upregulates expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, both features of hair-inducing human DPCs (hDPCs). In this study, we further examined the effects and signaling pathways associated with VD (3) actions on DPCs. VD (3) suppressed hDPC proliferation in a dose-dependent, noncytotoxic manner. Among the Wnt-related genes investigated, Wnt10b expression was significantly upregulated by VD (3) in hDPCs. Wnt10b upregulation, as well as upregulation of ALPL (ALP, liver/bone/kidney) and TGF-beta2, by VD (3) was specific in hDPCs and not detected in human dermal fibroblasts. Screening of paracrine or endocrine factors in the skin indicated that all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) upregulated Wnt10b gene expression, although synergistic upregulation (combined atRA and VD (3)) was not seen. RNA interference with vitamin D receptor (VDR) revealed that VD (3) upregulation of Wnt10b, ALPL, and TGF-beta2 was mediated through the genomic VDR pathway. In a rat model of de novo hair regeneration by murine DPC transplantation, pretreatment with VD (3) significantly enhanced hair folliculogenesis. Specifically, a greater number of outgrowing hair shafts and higher maturation of regenerated follicles were observed. Together, these data suggest that VD (3) may promote functional differentiation of DPCs and be useful in preserving the hair follicle-inductive capacity of cultured DPCs for hair regeneration therapies.",

Adult stem cells reside in specialized niches where they receive environmental cues to maintain tissue homeostasis. In mammals, the stem cell niche within hair follicles is home to epithelial hair follicle stem cells and melanocyte stem cells, which sustain cyclical bouts of hair regeneration and pigmentation. To generate pigmented hairs, synchrony is achieved such that upon initiation of a new hair cycle, stem cells of each type activate lineage commitment. Dissecting the inter-stem-cell crosstalk governing this intricate coordination has been difficult, because mutations affecting one lineage often affect the other. Here we identify transcription factor NFIB as an unanticipated coordinator of stem cell behaviour. Hair follicle stem-cell-specific conditional targeting of Nfib in mice uncouples stem cell synchrony. Remarkably, this happens not by perturbing hair cycle and follicle architecture, but rather by promoting melanocyte stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The early production of melanin is restricted to melanocyte stem cells at the niche base. Melanocyte stem cells more distant from the dermal papilla are unscathed, thereby preventing hair greying typical of melanocyte stem cell differentiation mutants. Furthermore, we pinpoint KIT-ligand as a dermal papilla signal promoting melanocyte stem cell differentiation. Additionally, through chromatin-immunoprecipitation with high-throughput-sequencing and transcriptional profiling, we identify endothelin 2 (Edn2) as an NFIB target aberrantly activated in NFIB-deficient hair follicle stem cells. Ectopically induced Edn2 recapitulates NFIB-deficient phenotypes in wild-type mice. Conversely, endothelin receptor antagonists and/or KIT blocking antibodies prevent precocious melanocyte stem cell differentiation in the NFIB-deficient niche. Our findings reveal how melanocyte and hair follicle stem cell behaviours maintain reliance upon cooperative factors within the niche, and how this can be uncoupled in injury, stress and disease states.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of 6-gingerol, the main active component of ginger, on hair shaft elongation in vitro and hair growth in vivo. METHODS: Firstly, Hair follicles were co-cultured with 3 different concentration of 6-gingerol for 5 days and hair elongation in three groups was measured. Secondly, The proliferative effect of 6-gingerol on DPCs was measured using MTT assay. Thirdly, the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in DPCs were measured using Western blotting. In vivo study, the influence of 6-gingerol on hair growth in C57BL/6 rats was measured through topical application of 6-gingerol on the dorsal skin of each animal. RESULTS: The length of hair shaft in 20 microg/ml 6-Gingerol group (0. 50 +/-0. 08 mm) is less than 0 microg/ml (0. 66 +/-0. 19) mm and 10 microg/ml (0. 64 +/-0. 03) mm 6-Gingerol group (P < 0. 05). In cell culture, compared to 0 microg/ml and 5 microg/ml 6-Gingerol, 10 microg/ml 6-Gingerol can significantly inhibited the proliferation of DPCs (P < 0. 05). Along with the growth inhibition of DPCs by 6-gingerol, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased obviously. In vivo study, the hair length and density decreased a lot after using 1 mg/ml 6-gingerol. CONCLUSIONS: 6-Gingerol can suppress human hair shaft elongation because it has pro-apoptotic effects on DPCs via increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. It might inhibit hair growth by prolonging the telogen stage in vivo.",

Chrysanthemum zawadskii has been proven to possess hair growth activity and has been used as treatment for hair loss. The aim of this study was to provide a novel explanation of the mechanism by which Chrysanthemum zawadskii extracts (CZe) promote hair growth and to characterize the affected hair follicle (HF) regions and the progression of growth. The n-butanol and water fractions of CZe were used for hair growth induction by topical application to the backs of C57BL/6 mice for up to 30 days. To investigate cell development during HF morphogenesis, bromodeoxyuridine-labeled skin sections were detected using immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the water fraction of CZe promoted hair shaft production and induced premature entry of telogen HFs into the anagen. Subsequently, immunohistochemical studies indicated that the water fraction of CZe stimulated the differentiation and proliferation of pluripotent epidermal matrix cells in the matrix region and epithelial stem cells in the basal layer of the epidermis. Additionally, flavonoids were identified as effective constituents. Therefore, the findings of this study suggested that the water fraction of CZe may be developed as a therapeutic agent for the prevention of hair loss.",

We have recently shown that Merkel cells transduce tactile stimuli via Piezo2 channels to initiate the sense of touch. Here we performed patch-clamp recordings to assess single channel activity on the membranes of Merkel cells in whisker hair follicles. Under the cell-attached configuration, most Merkel cell membrane patches showed large outward unitary currents with single channel conductance being ~ 200pS. The outward unitary currents were not affected by negative pressures up to 150mmHg when applied to the membrane patches. The application of negative pressures up to 190mmHg also could not directly elicit any inward unitary current in the membrane patches. However, after establishing the whole-cell configuration, mechanically activated currents (MA) that resembled Piezo2 currents could be elicited by membrane displacements in every Merkel cell tested. While the MA current decayed rapidly, a small steady-state current component with significant channel noise could be observed. Applications of stationary and non-stationary fluctuation analyses to the MA currents yielded single channel conductance of 32. 5 +-3. 8 and 54. 0 +-5. 3pS, respectively. The lack of mechanical responses under the cell-attached configuration and the existence of Piezo2 MA currents under the whole-cell configuration raised a possibility that Piezo2 channels are preferentially located on Merkel cell processes, the membrane domains inaccessible by recording electrodes.",

OBJECTIVES: To assess hair morphology in androgenetic alopecia on sonography and electron microscopy. METHODS: A prospective study was performed in 33 patients with androgenetic alopecia and 10 unaffected control participants. In vivo sonography of the hair follicles of the scalp and in vitro sonography and electron microscopy of the hair shafts were performed according to a standardized protocol that included analysis of the right frontal and occipital regions. The upper frequency limit of the ultrasound probes ranged between 15 and 18 MHz. RESULTS: Scalp hair follicles and hair shafts were recognizable on sonography in all cases. Hair follicles in alopecia cases had significantly lower depths (P <. 05). The hair shafts in alopecia also had a different distribution of their laminar pattern on in vitro sonography, with a greater presence of mixed (trilaminar and bilaminar) and solely bilaminar tracts in comparison with the controls (mostly trilaminar). On electron microscopy, the alopecia hair tracts showed irregularities and commonly a \" \" melted candle \" \" appearance of the cuticle. CONCLUSIONS: Sonography and electron microscopy uncover distinct abnormalities in the morphology of hair in androgenetic alopecia, which may potentially support the diagnosis and management of this common condition. \"",

    "text": "Mouse hair cycle expression dynamics modeled as coupled mesenchymal and epithelial oscillators. The hair cycle is a dynamic process where follicles repeatedly move through phases of growth, retraction, and relative quiescence. This process is an example of temporal and spatial biological complexity. Understanding of the hair cycle and its regulation would shed light on many other complex systems relevant to biological and medical research. Currently, a systematic characterization of gene expression and summarization within the context of a mathematical model is not yet available. Given the cyclic nature of the hair cycle, we felt it was important to consider a subset of genes with periodic expression. To this end, we combined several mathematical approaches with high-throughput, whole mouse skin, mRNA expression data to characterize aspects of the dynamics and the possible cell populations corresponding to potentially periodic patterns. In particular two gene clusters, demonstrating properties of out-of-phase synchronized expression, were identified. A mean field, phase coupled oscillator model was shown to quantitatively recapitulate the synchronization observed in the data. Furthermore, we found only one configuration of positive-negative coupling to be dynamically stable, which provided insight on general features of the regulation. Subsequent bifurcation analysis was able to identify and describe alternate states based on perturbation of system parameters. A 2-population mixture model and cell type enrichment was used to associate the two gene clusters to features of background mesenchymal populations and rapidly expanding follicular epithelial cells. Distinct timing and localization of expression was also shown by RNA and protein imaging for representative genes. Taken together, the evidence suggests that synchronization between expanding epithelial and background mesenchymal cells may be maintained, in part, by inhibitory regulation, and potential mediators of this regulation were identified. Furthermore, the model suggests that impairing this negative regulation will drive a bifurcation which may represent transition into a pathological state such as hair miniaturization.",

    "text": "Red ginseng extract promotes the hair growth in cultured human hair follicles. Ginseng has been shown to promote hair growth in several recent studies. However, its effects on human hair follicles and its mechanisms of action have not been sufficiently elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the hair growth-promoting effects of red ginseng extract (RGE) and its ginsenosides. The proliferative activities of cultured human hair follicles treated with RGE and ginsenoside-Rb1 were assessed using Ki-67 immunostaining. Their effects on isolated human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) were evaluated using cytotoxicity assays, immunoblot analysis of signaling proteins, and the determination of associated growth factors. We examined the ability of RGE and ginsenosides to protect hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation against dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced suppression and their effects on the expression of androgen receptor. The in vivo hair growth-promoting effect of RGE was also investigated in C57BL/6 mice. Both RGE and ginsenoside-Rb1 enhanced the proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes. hDPCs treated with RGE or ginsenoside-Rb1 exhibited substantial cell proliferation and the associated phosphorylation of ERK and AKT. Moreover, RGE, ginsenoside-Rb1, and ginsenoside-Rg3 abrogated the DHT-induced suppression of hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation and the DHT-induced upregulation of the mRNA expression of androgen receptor in hDPCs. Murine experiments revealed that the subcutaneous injection of 3% RGE resulted in more rapid hair growth than the negative control. In conclusion, RGE and its ginsenosides may enhance hDPC proliferation, activate ERK and AKT signaling pathways in hDPCs, upregulate hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation, and inhibit the DHT-induced androgen receptor transcription. These results suggest that red ginseng may promote hair growth in humans.",

BACKGROUND: Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (FMF) represents a variant of MF characterized by hair follicle invasion of mature, CD4-positive small lymphoid cells with cerebriform nuclei. The disease displays resistance to standard treatment modalities and has an unfavourable course. OBJECTIVE: Clinical analysis of 17 patients with FMF collected between 2005 and 2012, investigation of tumour cells and involved hair follicle. METHODS: Re-evaluation of clinical data, wide panel immunohistochemistry investigation on paraffin-embedded biopsy material, T-cell receptor gene rearrangement analysis of the samples. RESULTS: Male and older age group predominance, frequent head-neck involvement, acneiform lesions, keratotic plugs, cysts, nodules, follicular papules, alopecia and classic mycosis fungoides-like plaques represented the main clinical characteristics. Treatment response showed a wide range from transient complete response to therapy resistance and death due to the disease. The pathological alterations: folliculotropism, mild epidermotropism, follicular plugging, mucinous degeneration of hair follicle, basaloid hyperplasia, syringotropism were similar to those observed previously. The first case of a CD8-positive folliculotropic mycosis fungoides-with unusual clinical presentation-is reported here. Nestin overexpression of mesenchymal cells of the isthmic and suprabulbar regions of hair follicle and the reappearance of dermal nestin-expressing cells were observed in association with immature dendritic cell hyperplasia. Altered CK19 expression was detected suggesting a potential role of follicular keratinocytes in the disease process. It was found that a proportion of neoplastic T cells constantly express programmed death-1 receptor in our patients contrary to classic mycosis fungoides. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of the clinical manifestation and the course of folliculotropic mycosis fungoides are broad and differ from classic mycosis fungoides. Folliculotropic neoplastic T-cell proliferation is associated with activation of inflammatory reactive T-and B-lymphoid cells, mesenchymal cells and changes in the hair follicle.",

Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) is a major component of hair coloring and black henna products. Although it has been largely demonstrated that PPD induces allergic reactions and increases the risk of tumors in the kidney, liver, thyroid gland and urinary bladder, the effect on dermal papilla cells remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the current study evaluated the effects of PPD on growth, cell death and senescence using cell-based assays and microRNA (miRNA) microarray in normal human hair dermal papilla cells (nHHDPCs). Cell viability and cell cycle analyses demonstrated that PPD exhibited a significant cytotoxic effect on nHHDPCs through inducing cell death and G2 phase cell cycle arrest in a dose-dependent manner. It was additionally observed that treatment of nHHDPCs with PPD induced cellular senescence by promoting cellular oxidative stress. In addition, the results of the current study indicated that these PPD-mediated effects were involved in the alteration of miRNA expression profiles. Treatment of nHHDPCs with PPD altered the expression levels of 74 miRNAs by > = 2-fold (16 upregulated and 58 downregulated miRNAs). Further bioinformatics analysis determined that these identified miRNA target genes were likely to be involved in cell growth, cell cycle arrest, cell death, senescence and the induction of oxidative stress. In conclusion, the observations of the current study suggested that PPD was able to induce several cytotoxic effects through alteration of miRNA expression levels in nHHDPCs.",

    "text": "Synergistic effect of PDGF and FGF2 for cell proliferation and hair inductive activity in murine vibrissal dermal papilla in vitro. BACKGROUND: The dermal papilla is composed of a small clump of mesenchymal cells, called dermal papilla cells (DPCs). DPCs closely interact with epidermal cells to give rise to hair follicles and shafts during hair follicle development and the hair cycle. DPCs are promising cell sources for hair regeneration therapy for alopecia patients. However, once DPCs are put into conventional two-dimensional culture conditions, they quickly lose their capability to produce hair follicles. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to expand a sufficiently large population of DPCs that retain their hair inductive activity. METHODS: Murine DPCs were cultured in the presence of platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Expressions of follicular-related genes were analyzed by real time PCR and hair inductive activity was determined by patch assay and chamber assay in vivo. RESULTS: FGF2 significantly increased the expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) in cultured vibrissal DPCs. PDGF-AA, a ligand of PDGFRalpha, promoted proliferation of DPCs synergistically when utilized with FGF2 and enhanced the expression of several follicular-related genes in DPCs. Hair reconstitution assays revealed that DPCs treated with both PDGF-AA and FGF-2 were able to maintain their hair inductive activity better than those treated with FGF2 alone. CONCLUSION: Both cell proliferation and hair inductive activity in murine DPCs are maintained by the synergistic effect of FGF2 and PDGF-AA.",

We also demonstrated that GRe stimulated hair shaft elongation in the ex vivo cultures of vibrissa hair follicles isolated from C57BL/6 mouse. Systemic transcriptome analysis by next generation sequencing demonstrated that TGF-beta-pathway related genes were selectively down-regulated by treatment of GRe in vivo, and the same treatment suppressed TGF-beta-induced phosphorylation of ERK in HeLa cells.

    "text": "Body Hair Transplant by Follicular Unit Extraction: My Experience With 122 Patients. BACKGROUND: Body hair shafts from the beard, trunk, and extremities can be used to treat baldness when patients have inadequate amounts of scalp donor hair, but reports in the literature concerning use of body hair to treat baldness are confined to case reports. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the outcome of body hair transplanted to bald areas of the scalp in selected patients. METHODS: From 2005 through 2011, 122 patients preselected for adequate body hair had donor hair transplanted from the beard, trunk, and the extremities to the scalp by follicular unit extraction (FUE) by the author at a single center. All patients were emailed surveys to assess surgical outcomes and overall satisfaction. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients (64. 8%) responded with a mean time of 2. 9 years between date of last surgery and time of survey. Patients were generally very satisfied with results of their procedure, giving mean scores of at least a 7. 8 on a Likert-like scale of 0 to 10 for their healing status, hair growth in recipient areas, and overall satisfaction with their surgeries. These scores were comparable to mean scores provided by patients whose transplants included scalp donor sources. CONCLUSIONS: FUE using body hair can be an effective hair transplantation method for a select patient population of hirsute individuals who suffer from severe baldness or have inadequate scalp donor reserve.

Franco is traditionally known to potentiate hair growth promotion. However, there has been no report on its main active ingredient responsible for the hair growth activity. In the current work, cedrol as a major constituent from P. orientalis was evaluated for its potential on hair growth in vivo. Different concentrations of cedrol (10, 20 and 30mg/mL) were applied topically over the shaved skin of C57BL/6 mice and monitored for 21days. Results indicated that cedrol significantly promoted hair growth in a dose-dependent manner, particularly for the female mice. Both male and female mice groups treated with 30mg/mL cedrol required shorter time than the blank control and 2% minoxidil groups at different growth stages. Compared with the blank control (8. 87mm) and 2% minoxidil (9. 94mm) groups at 21days, the hair length of female mice treated with 30mg/mL cedrol showed a remarkable increase with the value of 11. 07mm. Hair in male and female mice groups treated with 30mg/mL cedrol was heavier than the 2% minoxidil (38. 2 and 35. 9mg, respectively) groups with the weight of 42. 6 and 45. 2mg, respectively. Further observation of the hair follicle demonstrated that cedrol exerted a remarkable effect on the hair follicle length. These findings suggested that cedrol may be the main active ingredient of P. orientalis and have the potential of becoming a new hair growth promoter.",

Among the genes studied, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7), and sideroflexin 1 (SFXN1) showed a significantly different pattern of expression in large, medium, and small wave follicles (P < 0. 05). The expression of MMP2 had a significant positive correlation with secondary follicles in large waves (P < 0. 05), while the expression of BMP7 had a significant correlation with primary follicle diameter in small wave follicles, and a highly significant positive correlation with the number of secondary follicles in the small waves (P < 0. 01). The expression of SFXN1 was significantly and positively correlated with the diameters of small wave primary follicles ; it also showed a highly significant positive correlation with secondary follicle diameters. Although other genes are associated with hair follicles, their expression in large, medium, and small wave follicles was not significant.

The direct fluorescent antibody test (dFAT) on fresh brain tissues is the gold standard for rabies virus antigen detection in dogs. However, this method is laborious and holds a high risk of virus exposure for the experimenter. Skin biopsies are useful for the diagnosis of humans and animals. In mammals, the tactile hair, known as the follicle-sinus complex (FSC), is a specialized touch organ that is abundant in the muzzle skin. Each tactile hair is equipped with more than 2, 000 sensory nerve endings. Therefore, this organ is expected to serve as an alternative postmortem diagnostic material. However, the target cells and localization of rabies virus antigen in the FSCs remain to be defined. In the present study, muzzle skins were obtained from 60 rabid dogs diagnosed with rabies by dFAT at the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine in the Philippines. In all dogs, virus antigen was clearly detected in a part of the outer root sheath at the level of the ring sinus of the FSCs, and the majority of cells were positive for the Merkel cell (MC) markers cytokeratin 20 and CAM5. 2.

This report describes the use of the robotic system in a megasession for hair restoration. Patients were instructed to cut their hair to 1. 0 to 1. 2 mm before surgery. The robot selected and removed 600 to 800 grafts per hour so the follicular units (FU) s could be transplanted manually to recipient sites. The robot arm consists of a sharp inner punch and a blunt outer punch which together separate FUs from the sur-rounding tissue. Stereoscopic cameras controlled by image processing software allow the system to identify the angle and direction of hair growth. The physician and one assistant control the harvesting with a hand-held remote control and computer monitor while the patient is positioned in an adjustable chair. When the robot has harvested all the FUs they are removed by technicians with small forceps. Hairline design, creation of recipient sites, and graft placement are performed manually by the physician. Clinical photographs before and after surgery show that patients experience excellent outcomes with the robotic megasession. Phy-sician fatigue during graft extraction is reduced because the robot performs the repetitive movements without fatigue. Variability of graft extraction is minimized because the robot ' s optical system can be programmed to choose the best FUs. The transection rate is reduced because the robot ' s graft extraction system uses two needles, a sharp one to piece the skin and a blunt needle to dissect the root without trauma. A robotic megasession for hair restoration is minimally invasive, does not result in linear scars in the donor area, and is associated with minimal fatigue and discomfort for both patient and physician. Healing is rapid and patients experience a high level of satisfaction with the results. < em > J Drugs Dermatol. 2016 ; 15 (11): 1407-1412. </em >.",

This prospective study assessed the axillary, arm, thigh, and back hair clearing ef cacy of the LightSheer In nity 1060 nm diode laser in 10 Fitzpatrick skin type IV-V patients. Each area was treated up to ve times, at 4-6-week intervals, after which immediate skin responses and adverse events were recorded. Hair count, color and coarseness were assessed before each treatment session, as well as 1, 3, and 6 months following the last session. Both patients and the treating physician rated the degree of improvement with time, and patients also ranked their satisfaction with the treatment outcome. Percent hair reduction from baseline gradually increased with treatment and peaked at 74. 6%, 68. 4%, and 65. 7% for axillary, arm and thigh regions, respectively, 6 months following the last treatment session. Baseline hair growth patterns precluded effective selection of a representative area for hair counting.

OBJECTIVE: This experiment was conducted to study the histological characteristics, age-related thickness changes, and expression of HSPs in the skin of yak. METHODS: A total of 20 yaks (10 males and 10 females) were used. Different regions of the normal skin of three different ages (newborn, half-year-old and adult) of yaks were harvested for histological study and thickness measurement. Biopsy samples were taken from the scapula regions of the skin from the same five approximately 1-year-old yaks during the hair cycle (telogen, anagen and catagen). RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry methods using the mRNA and protein levels were used to detect the expression of HSP27, HSP70 and HSP90. RT-PCR method was used to detect the mRNA expression of CGI-58 and KDF1. The IPP6. 0 software was used to analyze the immunohistochemistry and measure the thickness of the skin. RESULTS: The general histological structure of hairy yak skin was similar to other domestic mammals. The unique features included prominent cutaneous vascular plexuses, underdeveloped sweat glands, a large number of nasolabial glands in the nasolabial plate, and hair follicle groups composed of one primary follicle and several secondary follicles. The skin, epidermis and dermis thickness did vary significantly between different body regions and different ages. The thickness of the skin, epidermis and dermis increased from newborn to adult in yaks. Yak skin thickness decreased from dorsally to ventrally on the trunk. The skin on the lateral surface was thicker than the skin on the medial surface on the limbs. HSP27, HSP70 and HSP90 showed different expression patterns during the hair cycle using RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry methods. The expression of HSP27 mRNA and protein in the anagen stage was the highest, followed by the catagen stage, and the expression in the telogen stage was the lowest. The expression of HSP70 mRNA and protein in the telogen stage was the highest, followed by the anagen stage, and the expression in the catagen stage was the lowest. The expression of HSP90 mRNA and protein in the anagen stage was the highest, followed by the telogen stage, and the expression in the catagen stage was the lowest. HSPs were mainly expressed in the outer root sheath of hair follicle during the hair cycle, also expressed in epidermis, sebaceous gland and sweat gland in the skin of Yak. The expression of CGI-58 mRNA in the anagen stage was the highest, followed by the catagen stage, and the expression in the telogen stage was the lowest. The expression of KDF1 mRNA in the telogen stage was the highest, followed by the catagen stage, and the expression in the anagen stage was the lowest. MEANING: In this study, we examined and fully described the histology of normal skin in Yak and measured the skin thickness of different ages and different regions in Yak. These data may be useful to better understand and appreciate the adaptability features of yak skin. Our investigation reports the expression patterns of HSPs in yak skin for the first time. The different expression pattern of HSPs during the hair cycle suggests they may play different roles in yak hair follicle biology.",

The evidence is, however, not robust, and a number of methodological and technical limitations can be identified in these studies. In this study, we looked at the expression of proliferation, mitosis and apoptosis markers directly at acne skin lesions in 66 patients with acne vulgaris. Ki67 was assessed using immunohistochemistry and alpha-tubulin, phospho-histone H3 and cleaved-PARP with immunofluorescence microscopy. Allogenic unaffected hair follicles from the same acne patients were used as an internal control. In both acne and control hair follicles, the alpha-tubulin staining was universal, approaching 100% cells and showed no signs of changed assembly. Expression of cleaved-PARP-the apoptosis marker-was a rare event. Cell proliferation rate measured by the expression of Ki67 and phospho-histone H3 was virtually identical between acne and the two control groups.

Hair growth disorders often carry a major psychological burden. Therefore, more effective human hair growth-modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound to identify new hair growth-promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/beta-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non-immune-inhibitory CsA target ; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical beta-catenin activity in a human (mini-) organ ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth. Since inhibiting SFRP1 only facilitates Wnt signalling through ligands that are already present, this ' ligand-limited ' therapeutic strategy for promoting human hair growth may circumvent potential oncological risks associated with chronic Wnt over-activation.",

The psychological impact can be significant, leading to feelings of depression and social isolation. Objectives In this article, we seek to review the pathophysiological mechanisms proposed in recent years in a narrative fashion. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Scopus for articles related to alopecia areata, with a particular emphasis on its pathogenesis. RESULTS: The main theory of alopecia areata pathogenesis is that it is an autoimmune phenomenon resulting from a disruption in hair follicle immune privilege. What causes this breakdown is an issue of debate. Some believe that a stressed hair follicle environment triggers antigen presentation, while others blame a dysregulation in the central immune system entangling the follicles. Evidence for the latter theory is provided by animal studies, as well investigations around the AIRE gene. Different immune-cell lines including plasmacytoid dendritic cells, natural killer cells and T cells, along with key molecules such as interferon-gamma, interleukin-15, MICA and NKG2D, have been identified as contributing to the autoimmune process. CONCLUSIONS: Alopecia areata remains incurable, although it has been studied for years. Available treatment options at best are beneficial for milder cases, and the rate of relapse is high. Understanding the exact mechanisms of hair loss in alopecia areata is therefore of utmost importance to help identify potential therapeutic targets.",

BACKGROUND: Premature desquamation of the inner root sheath (PDIRS) is considered one of the distinctive features in central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA). However, PDIRS can be seen in other alopecia subtypes, and its utility in the diagnosis of CCCA has been debated. We aimed to examine a large cohort of alopecia cases for the presence of PDIRS in association with and without inflammation to determine whether PDIRS in noninflamed follicles can be used as a specific marker of CCCA. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on 501 histologically unambiguous cases of alopecia (111 of CCCA, 102 of lichen planopilaris, 62 of discoid lupus erythematosus, 16 of acne keloidalis nuchae, 27 of folliculitis decalvans, 80 of androgenetic alopecia, 97 of alopecia areata, and 6 of psoriatic alopecia). The frequency of PDIRS, including cases with and without inflammation, was determined. RESULTS: PDIRS was identified in all alopecia subtypes evaluated. When PDIRS was identified in lichen planopilaris, discoid lupus erythematosus, acne keloidalis nuchae, and alopecia areata, 100% of cases were in inflamed follicles. PDIRS in noninflamed follicles occurred in 73% (81/111) of CCCA, 33% (2/6) of psoriatic alopecia, 11% (3/27) of folliculitis decalvans, and 1% (1/97) of androgenetic alopecia. The presence of PDIRS in at least one noninflamed hair follicle correlated with a diagnosis of CCCA with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 98% (P-value < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Identifying PDIRS in noninflamed hair follicles is a useful histologic feature in the evaluation of scalp biopsies and seems to be relatively specific for CCCA.",

Spontaneous hair repigmentation of physiologically white or gray hair is a rare occurrence that may be associated with melanoma in elderly individuals. We present the first case of this phenomenon in a man. A gray-haired, 80-year-old man presented to dermatology clinic with a 3-cm lock of black hair on his vertex scalp that developed over 1 year. Punch biopsies showed an increase in junctional dendritic melanocytes with rare pagetoid cells and extension along the follicular outer root sheath epithelium and interfollicular epidermis, associated with prominent dendritic melanocytic hyperplasia and pigment-containing melanocytes within the hair bulbs. Although the findings on the biopsies were not diagnostic of melanoma in situ, an irregular interfollicular distribution of melanocytes was concerning for an adjacent atypical process. A complete excision was performed and revealed melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type. Rare reports describe spontaneous hair repigmentation as a harbinger of lentigo maligna in women. Repigmentation can occur in the setting of proliferation of malignant pigment-producing melanocytes or by paracrine stimulation of benign bulbar melanocytes through receptor tyrosine kinase KIT activation. Presence of prominent dendritic melanocytic hyperplasia and pigment-containing melanocytes within the hair bulbs in our patient ' s biopsies was suggestive of paracrine or physiologic stimulation of bulbar melanocytes. Given the importance of early melanoma detection and the low visibility of the scalp, this report raises awareness of an extraordinary presentation of lentigo maligna and exemplifies the importance of close clinicopathologic correlation to ensure optimal clinical management and patient outcome.",

Background: Although stable cicatricial alopecia (SCA) secondary to surgical events of the scalp can affect patients ' psychosocial status, hair transplantation onto postsurgical scar tissue on the scalp is challenging because of tissue stiffness and poor blood circulation. Objective: In contrast to traditional surgical treatments, such as excision, local flap, and tissue expansion, follicular unit (FU) hair transplantation offers aesthetically pleasing results in the treatment of postsurgically induced SCA. Materials and Methods: This study included 15 patients with SCA of the scalp due to postsurgical scarring. The patients underwent a single session of hair transplantation of approximately 35 units/cm2 density. The graft survival rate was evaluated 12 months after the procedure. The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) was used to analyze the preoperative and postoperative satisfaction. Results: The FUE hair transplantation had a mean survival rate of 80. 67% (range 70-90%). The patient and observer satisfaction significantly improved after the procedure ; the POSAS scores were 24. 47 (range 16-38) preoperatively and 11. 60 (range 7-18) postoperatively.

BACKGROUND: This study focused on the differences in hairy root fungal microecology between androgenetic alopecia patients and healthy individuals. METHODS: Light microscopy was used to observe the morphology of hairy roots. Morphological observations were also performed in the positive specimens using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The high-throughput sequencing method was used to detect the fungal microecology of hairy roots at different sites. Moreover, the comparison of fungal loads of Malassezia in different group and scalp area were tested by PCR. RESULTS: The fungi in the hair root observed by optical microscopy are mainly Malassezia yeast. The positive rate of Malassezia in the hair loss group (60%) was higher than that in the control group (40%). The detection efficiency of Malassezia examined by scanning electron microscopy was higher than that by light microscopy. Results acquired from high-throughput molecular sequencing of fungi suggested that Ascomycota was the dominant species, whereas in the occipital hair roots of the control group Basidiomycota was the dominant species in the hair loss group. Malassezia followed by Trichosporon were the most abundant fungal genera. The changes in abundance at the top and occipital region of the control group were more significant than those of the genus Fusarium, followed by Epicoccum and Malassezia. The load of Malassezia located on calvaria in the alopecia group was significantly higher than that in the control group. In the alopecia group, the load of Malassezia on the scalp was higher than that on the occipital region. The load of Malassezia globosa and Malassezia restricta in the hair loss group was higher on calvaria and occipital areas. CONCLUSION: Malassezia had a positive correlation with the incidence of androgenic alopecia.",

Whilst topical steroids represent one of the most frequently administered treatments for skin and hair diseases, predominantly based on their glucocorticoid receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory effects, the mineralocorticoid effects of topical steroids have received surprisingly little attention. However, the role of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling is now known to extend beyond the kidney, with human skin, including the hair follicle (HF), expressing the MR. Using microdissected female HFs treated ex vivo with MR agonists and antagonists, we sought to determine the effects of MR-mediated signaling in the cutaneous context. Indeed, not only did the skin and HF epithelium express the MR at both the gene and protein level, but its expression was hair cycle dependent. Moreover, the selective MR antagonist eplerenone promoted hair shaft elongation and hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation whilst delaying catagen (HF regression). These novel observations suggest that the female human HF is sensitive to the inhibition of MR signaling and provide the first evidence that sustained MR signaling may even be required to maintain the growth phase (anagen) of human scalp HFs. Indeed, these data encourage the systematic evaluation of MR agonists and antagonists in human hair growth control so as to identify much-needed, novel anti-hirsutism and/or hair growth-promoting agents, respectively.",

Evaluation of these differences is essential to assessing future intervention outcomes. The study was a prospective controlled clinical trial. Included were 19 adult burn survivors (18-63 years old, average age 47 ; 15 male, 4 female, 14 Caucasian, 2 African American, 1 Hispanic ; 11 flame burns, 5 scald burns, 2 grease burns and 1 electrical burn, 2%-60% TBSA) with conspicuous, mature scars. All study subjects had either skin-grafted or nongrafted scars, as well as healthy skin in the same body area, to control for intraindividual variability. All scars were at least 9 months old and at a minimum 2 x 2 cm2 in size. On each individual, at least one nongrafted scar or one grafted scar and healthy skin was imaged with a high-definition ultrasound device (Longport, Inc., Glen Mills, PA, 35MHz probe, 1500 m/s). Vancouver scar scale was assessed. Although scarred skin had significantly fewer follicles than healthy skin in both grafted (P <. 0001) and un-grafted sites (P =. 0090), there were even significantly fewer follicles in grafted scars than un-grafted scars (P =. 0095). In thickness of the sub-epidermal layer, there was no difference between grafted and un-grafted scars (P =. 1900). Both kinds of scars had a significantly thicker sub-epidermal layer than healthy skin (P =. 0010). Vancouver scar scale was 7. 4 for grafted and 4. 6 for nongrafted scars with grafted flame burn scars ranging higher than all others (5-11). There was no discomfort during the imaging, and no adverse events occurred during the study period. Our study demonstrates two clear morphologic differences between scars and healthy skin: thickness of the sub-epidermal layer and hair follicle density. Grafted burn scars were shown to contain fewer hair follicles than un-grafted scars.",

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was first to demonstrate that a combination of pyridine-2, 4-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester and resveratrol could synergize in vitro on biological pathways associated with hair growth and then to demonstrate the benefit on hair density in a clinical study. METHODS: The effects of pyridine-2, 4-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester and resveratrol directly on the hypoxic inducible factor-1alpha protein (HIF-1alpha) and related genes expression were demonstrated on keratinocytes in culture in vitro using western-blot analysis and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The effect of resveratrol against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment was studied in hair follicle and hair matrix cells in vitro using the sensitive probe Dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Finally, a randomized clinical study on hair density was conducted on 79 Caucasian female subjects to assess the effect of this combination of actives. RESULTS: Pyridine-2, 4-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester and resveratrol stabilized HIF-1a protein and increased the expression of HIF-1alpha target genes. Resveratrol significantly reduced the oxygen peroxide-induced oxidative stress generated in hair follicle and hair matrix cells. The clinical study showed that a topical treatment with the combination significantly increased the hair density on women from 1. 5 months. CONCLUSION: In addition to the antioxidant properties of resveratrol, the association of pyridine-2, 4-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester and resveratrol revealed a synergistic effect on the HIF-1alpha pathway. The results of the clinical study confirmed the importance of such a combination to increase the hair density.",

As distinct from many other cancer types, the incidence of melanoma has been increasing steadily over the last century. Discovering new risk factors of melanoma will not only raise public awareness but also potentially contribute to the improvement of skin cancer protection in the future. Nowadays, the tendency of shaving skin hair is becoming increasingly popular for aesthetic purposes. However, human hair serves several functions, one of which is ultraviolet (UV) protection for the skin. What is more, stem cells found in the follicles of hair could be the origin of melanoma upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the effect of shaving on solar UV transmission in the skin. To achieve that, two groups of skin models are constructed in TracePro software: one with unaltered hair and one with shaved hair. The UV transport in the models is simulated using the Monte Carlo method and the absorptions in the stem cells layer are compared. It is found that shaving will increase the UV transmission to the follicular stem cells to a certain degree. More specifically, shaving limbs will generally increase the solar UV transmission from about 5% to 20% in the UV wavelength range.",

BACKGROUND: During goat embryonic morphogenesis and postnatal initiation of hair follicle (HF) regeneration, dermal papilla (DP) cells play a vital role in hair formation. Growing evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in HF development and DP cell proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. RESULT: In this study, we utilized miRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq) to identify differentially expressed miRNAs at different HF cycling stages (anagen and telogen). MiRNA-Seq has identified 411 annotated miRNAs and 130 novel miRNAs in which 29 miRNAs were up-regulated and 32 miRNAs were down-regulated in the anagen phase compared to the telogen phase. Target gene prediction and functional enrichment analysis indicated some major biological pathways related to hair cycling, such as Wnt signaling pathways, ECM-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling pathway, biosynthesis of amino acids, metabolic pathways, ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation. Also, we explored the function of chi-miR-30b-5p in regulating hair growth cycle. Similar to the HF cycling, DP cells were isolated from skin and used to investigate miRNA functions. The MTT and EdU assays showed that the viability and proliferation of DP cells were inhibited or promoted after the transfection of chi-miR-30b-5p mimic or inhibitor, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed CaMKIIdelta as a candidate target gene of chi-miR-30b-5p, and the dual-luciferase and western blot assay demonstrated that chi-miR-30b-5p bound to the 3 ' UTR of CaMKIIdelta and further inhibited its translation. CONCLUSION: Chi-miR-30b-5p was found to be highly expressed in the telogen than that in the anagen phase and could inhibit the proliferation of DP cells by targeting CaMKIIdelta.

Objective: Although azelaic acid is effective for treatment of acne and rosacea, the biological activity of azelaic acid and the effect of its combination therapy with minoxidil were not elucidated with regard to hair growth. Materials and Methods: In this study, mouse vibrissae follicles were dissected on day 10 after depilation. Then, the bulb and bulge cells of the hair follicle were treated with minoxidil and azelaic acid for 10 days to evaluate Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein expression. Moreover, bulge and bulb cells of the hair follicles were cultivated and the expression of Gli1, Gli2, and Axin2 mRNA levels was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. We further investigated the protective effects of azelaic acid against ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation in cultured bulb and bulge cells by determining catalase activity. An irradiation dose of 20 mJ/cm2 UVB for 4 sec was chosen. Results: The results showed that catalase activity significantly (p < 0. 05) increased in the bulge cells after exposure to 2. 5 mM and 25 mM azelaic acid. Meanwhile, treatment of the bulb cells with azelaic acid (2. 5 and 25 mM) did not cause significant changes in catalase activity. We also found that azelaic acid (25 mM) alone upregulated Gli1 and Gli2 expression in the bulge cells and 100 micro minoxidil caused Gli1 and Axin2 overexpression in the bulb region of the hair follicle. Moreover, minoxidil (100 microM) alone and in combination with azelaic acid (25 mM) led to Shh protein overexpression in the hair follicles in vitro and in organ culture. Conclusion: Our results indicated a potential role for azelaic acid in the protection of bulge cells from UVB damage and its combination with minoxidil may activate hair growth through overexpression of Shh protein.",

Anemarrhena asphodeloides is a herb commonly used for metabolic disorders in China. The present study is the first to show that the timosaponin BII, which is present at a high concentration in A. asphodeloides, promotes hair growth in C57BL/6 male mice. The results indicate that timosaponin BII may be a potential promoting agent for hair growth.",

    "text": "Melanocytes derived from mouse hair follicles: A novel study model to assess pigmentation disorders. Melanocytes are the major cells responsible for skin and fair pigmentation in vertebrates. They localize to hair follicles (HFs) and the epidermis during embryonic development. A reduced number or dysfunction of melanocytes results in pigmentation disorders. Thus, methods for isolation, culture, and identification of melanocytes in mouse hair follicles provide an experimental basis for thestudy of of pigmentation disorders. In the current work, we harvested the melanocytes from the anagen phase dorsal skin of C57BL/6 mice. After its separation from the skin, the dermis was digested, and the HFs were released. HFs were then also digested, and the cells released from HFs were cultured in melanocyte growth medium. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining were used to localize the distribution of melanocytes in HFs. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expression of specific melanocyte marker genes. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and western blot were carried out to detect the expression of marker proteins in cells. 3, 4-Dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) staining was used to detect the pigmentation functionality of melaonocytes. Based on our results, we conclude that mature and functional melanocytes can be successfully obtained from theHFs, providing a cell model to study pigmentation disorders. The current findings provide novel insights for the treatment of pigmentation disorders by autologous cell transplantation. Further, we believe that issues related to skin damage, insufficient numbers of autologous cells, and autoimmune problems can be resolved in future though the use of functional melanocytes.",

INTRODUCTION: Hair loss due to scarring as a consequence of surgical procedures and trauma can impact young patients socially and emotionally. Recently follicular unit extraction (FUE) hair transplantation has been applied to scar treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This report included four patients with scarring alopecia. All patients were female with a mean age of 12. 5 years. Previous operations that caused scarring were sebaceous nevus excision with direct closure (n = 2), an extensive burn scar treated using an expander (n = 1) and cauterization for a congenital pigmented nevus (n = 1). The average size of the affected area was 10. 5 cm2. The FUE transplantation procedure was performed under local anesthesia. The number of grafts was set at approximately 25-30 grafts/cm2 of scar. An electronic punch with a diameter of 0. 8 mm was used for graft harvesting, and a 0. 6-mm electronic punch was used to make cylindrical holes on recipient site. The donor sites were shaved followed by graft harvesting in two cases. For the other two cases, harvesting was done without shaving. RESULTS: The number of transplanted grafts was 60 to 600 (mean 288), and surgical time was 38 to 220 minutes (mean 108). The average dose of lidocaine was 1. 4 mg/kg. The average survival rate of the grafts was 85%. CONCLUSION: Our experience in these cases suggests that this technique may be a viable option for the treatment of certain causes of scarring alopecia in the pediatric age group.",

The follicular route is an important drug penetration pathway in any topical application, either concerning dermatological and cosmetic skin treatments or any transdermal administration regimen. Efficient transport into follicles will depend on drug inherent properties but also on the chosen vehicle. The main study goal was to compare several systems for the delivery to the hair bulb of two fluorescent molecules of different water affinities: the hydrophobic Nile Red and the quite similar but hydrophilic Nile Blue. Three common nanoparticle types were compared in terms of encapsulation efficiency and stability: liposomes, ethosomes and polymeric nanoparticles. A liquid serum-like formulation was also developed, adjusting the final ethanol amount to the type of dye to be solubilized. Then, this formulation and the nanoparticle systems that successfully passed characterization and stability stages were further studied on their ability to reach the bulb. The serum formulation was able to deliver, both drug models, to deeper follicular regions than nanoparticles. Attending to the envisioned zone target of the follicle, the simplest approach proved to be the best choice from all the systems tested in this work. Nonetheless, nanocarriers and the inherent complexity of their manufacturing processes may be justified under very specific requirements.",

BACKGROUND: Recent advances in robotic surgery have extended to hair restoration surgery, using a robotic recipient site creation device. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the surgical safety and postoperative clinical outcomes of using this robotic system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one men diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia, who underwent hair transplantation with robotic recipient site creation, were retrospectively reviewed. Their mean age was 38. 7 +-9. 5 (range, 22-67) years. RESULTS: The total number of robotically created recipient sites was 36, 273. The average site creation speed was 1, 593 +-544 sites per hour. Postoperative crusting (54. 8%) was the most frequent complication in the recipient area, followed by pruritus (12. 9%), asymmetry (6. 5%), and folliculitis (6. 5%). The mean score of cosmetic outcomes and patient satisfaction, scored on a 5-point scale, was 4. 10 +-0. 54 and 4. 13 +-0. 85, respectively. No significant differences in cosmetic outcomes and patient satisfaction were found between 3 operators. CONCLUSION: The current device can automatically make slit incisions in the recipient area with speed and consistency noninferior to manual site creation. It is both safe and reliable for clinical use, and it is also easily managed by different hair surgeons without a long learning curve.",

In this study, we show that dermal-papilla-cell-like cells (DPC-LCs) can be generated by treating fibroblasts, including L929 mouse fibroblast cell lines and somatic mouse fibroblasts, with small molecules. Based on alkaline phosphatase activity and other molecular markers, different compounds or their combinations are needed for converting the two different fibroblasts into DPC-LCs. Notably, we found that TTNPB alone can efficiently convert primary adult mouse fibroblasts into DPC-LCs. DPC-LCs generated from mouse fibroblasts showed a stronger hair-inducing capacity. Transcriptome analysis reveals that expression of genes associated with a hair-inducing capacity are increased in DPC-LCs.

Superficial fungal infections are of serious concern worldwide due to their morbidity and increasing distribution across the globe in this era of growing antimicrobial resistance. The delivery of antifungals to the target regions of the skin and sustaining the effective drug concentration are essential for successful treatment of such mycoses. Topical formulations get extra benefits here if they penetrate into the hair follicles since fungal hyphae can proliferate and produce spores in such reservoirs. We designed a novel particulate system for the encapsulation and intrafollicular delivery of griseofulvin (Gf) antifungal drug, which is water-insoluble and currently commercially available in oral dosage forms. Micron-sized calcium carbonate (vaterite) carriers containing 25 +-3% (w/w) of Gf were prepared via the wet chemical method. The successful in vivo transportation of the carriers into the hair follicles of rats was demonstrated using scanning electron and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In addition, we introduced an approach toward Gf release prolongation for the proposed system. The stabilizing coatings were formed on the surface of the obtained particles via the layer-by-layer technique. The formulations displayed sufficient biocompatibility and good cellular uptake in contact with fibroblast cells in vitro. Four different coatings were tested for their preserving ability in the course of continued carrier incubation in the model media. The best release prolonging formulation liberated 38% of the loaded Gf during 5 days, while the uncoated carriers demonstrated more than 50% drug release within the first 24 h in water. To assess the in vivo release properties, free Gf drug and Gf-loaded carriers (uncovered and covered with the stabilizing shell) were administered topically in rats and the drug excretion profiles were further studied. By comparing the daily Gf levels in urine, we verified the sustained effect (longer than a week) of the stabilizing shell formed on the carrier surface. Conversely, the application of the free drug did not provide reliable Gf detection for this period. These findings open new prospects for the efficiency enhancement of topical therapeutics. Importantly, the elaborated system could be adapted for the dermal delivery of various water-insoluble drugs beyond the scope of antifungal therapy.",

Recent progress emphasizes the micro-and macro-environment that controls the regeneration process. There is a shift from a stem cell-centered view toward the various layers of regulatory mechanisms that control hair regeneration, which include local growth factors, immune and neuroendocrine signals, and dietary and environmental factors. This is better suited for clinical application in multiple forms of hair disorders: in male pattern hair loss, the stem cells are largely preserved, but androgen signaling diminishes hair growth ; in alopecia areata, an immune attack is targeted toward the growing hair follicle without abrogating its regeneration capability. Genome-wide association studies further revealed the genetic bases of these disorders, although the precise pathological mechanisms of the identified loci remain largely unknown. By analyzing the dysregulation of hair regeneration under pathological conditions, we can better address the complex interactions among stem cells, the differentiated progeny, and mesenchymal components, and highlight the critical role of macroenvironment adjustment that is essential for hair growth and regeneration.

Meanwhile, the administration of CM-MNs induced a certain mechanical stimulation on the skin, which can also promote neovascularization. With the combined effects of the pro-angiogenic factors in CM and the mechanical stimulation induced by MNs, CM-MNs successfully boosted perifollicular vascularization, and activated hair follicle stem cells, thereby inducing notably faster hair regeneration at a lower administration frequency on AGA mouse model compared with minoxidil. Furthermore, we proved that the inhibition of perifollicular angiogenesis can restrain the awakening of hair follicle stem cells, elucidating the tight correlation between perifollicular angiogenesis and the activation of hair follicle stem cells.

Above all, we hope that this work will serve as an introduction to basic biologists who are looking for a defined biological system that illustrates many of the challenges of modern biology: cell differentiation, epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, stem cell biology, pattern formation, apoptosis, cell and organ growth cycles, and pigmentation. The most important theme in studying the cycling hair follicle is that the follicle is a regenerating system. By traversing the phases of the cycle (growth, regression, resting, shedding, then growth again), the follicle demonstrates the unusual ability to completely regenerate itself. The basis for this regeneration rests in the unique follicular epithelial and mesenchymal components and their interactions. Recently, some of the molecular signals making up these interactions have been defined. They involve gene families also found in other regenerating systems such as fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, Wnt pathway, Sonic hedgehog, neurotrophins, and homeobox. For the immediate future, our challenge is to define the molecular basis for hair follicle growth control, to regenerate a mature hair follicle in vitro from defined populations, and to offer real solutions to our patients ' problems.",

The mammalian hair follicle is a highly dynamic skin appendage that undergoes repeated cycles of growth and regression, involving closely co-ordinated regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The Myc superfamily of transcription factors have been strongly implicated in the regulation of these processes in many tissues. Using immunohistochemistry, we have investigated the patterns of c-Myc, N-Myc, Max, and Mad1-4 expression at different stages of the human hair growth cycle. N-Myc, Max, Mad1, and Mad3 immunoreactivity was detected in the epidermis and the epithelium of both anagen and telogen hair follicles. Three distinct patterns of hair follicle c-Myc immunoreactivity were observed. In the infundibulum, c-Myc staining was predominantly in the basal layers, with little detectable immunoreactivity in the terminally differentiating suprabasal layers ; this pattern was similar to that seen in the epidermis. In contrast, c-Myc expression in the follicle bulb was found both in the proliferating germinative epithelial cells and in the terminally differentiating matrix cells that give rise to the hair fiber. Finally, intense c-Myc immunoreactivity was detected in the bulge region of the outer root sheath. Using the C8/144B antibody as a bulge marker, we confirmed that c-Myc immunoreactivity in the outer root sheath correlates with the putative hair follicle stem cell compartment. c-Myc expression in the bulge was independent of the hair growth cycle stage. Our data suggest that Myc superfamily members serve different functions in separate epithelial compartments of the hair follicle and may play an important role in determining cell fate within the putative stem cell compartment.",

Pituitary PRL regulates seasonal hair follicle growth cycles in many mammals. Here we present the first evidence implicating PRL in the nonseasonal, wave-like pelage replacement of laboratory mice. In this study we show that messenger RNA transcripts encoding the one long and two short forms of PRL receptor are present in the skin of adult and neonate mice. The receptor protein was immunolocalized to the hair follicle as well as the epidermis and sebaceous glands. Furthermore, PRL messenger RNA was detected within skin extracts, suggesting a possible autocrine/paracrine role. Analysis of the hair growth phenotype of PRL gene-disrupted mice (PRLR (-/-)) revealed a change in the timing of hair cycling events. Although no hair follicle development differences were noted in PRLR (-/-) neonates, observations of the second generation of hair growth revealed PRLR (-/-) mice molted earlier than wild types (PRLR (+/+)). The advance was greater in females (29 days) than in males (4 days), resulting in the elimination of the sexual dimorphism associated with murine hair replacement. Heterozygotes were intermediate between PRLR (-/-) and PRLR (+/+) mice in molt onset. Once initiated, the pattern and progression of the molt across the body were similar in all genotypes. Although all fiber types were present and appeared structurally normal, PRLR (-/-) mice had slightly longer and coarser hair than wild types. These findings demonstrate that PRL has an inhibitory effect on murine hair cycle events. The pituitary PRL regulation of hair follicle cycles observed in seasonally responsive mammals may be a result of pituitary PRL interacting with a local regulatory mechanism.",

    "text": "Microtubule associated protein (MAP-2) expression defines the companion layer of the anagen hair follicle and an analogous zone in the nail unit. BACKGROUND: Microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2) is one of a group of polypeptides that are an integral component of the microtubular cytoskeletal structure of the central and peripheral nervous system. During the course of another investigation that utilized immunohistochemistry, MAP-2 expression was observed in the hair follicle, almost exclusively in the innermost layer of the outer root sheath of the anagen follicle. This innermost layer, the so-called companion layer, has unique properties that clearly distinguish it from the rest of the outer root sheath. Among these are diminished glycogenation and an intimate association with the Henle ' s layer, which it directly apposes. Numerous intercellular connections exist between the companion layer and Henle ' s layer and, in fact, the companion layer accompanies Henle ' s layer during its vertical ascent in the follicle. Circumferentially oriented keratin filaments have also been demonstrated between the companion layer and Henle ' s layer, apparently providing structural support to the inner root sheath. Experimentally, disturbances in the keratin filaments of the companion layer in animals ultimately results in destruction of the hair follicle and an alopecia. METHODS: Immunohistochemical studies for MAP-2 were performed on 25 additional paraffin-embedded scalp specimens using standard techniques. Because of the parallels between the follicle and nail, MAP-2 expression in the nail unit was also investigated in three specimens. RESULTS: The presence of MAP-2 in the companion layer was confirmed in all cases. Intense MAP-2 expression in the companion layer begins at the B-fringe (the start of the keratogenous zone with cornification of the Henle ' s layer of the inner sheath) and extends to the level of the isthmus where the inner root sheath exfoliates. MAP-2 is also expressed in the upper layers of the nail matrix. CONCLUSION: The expression of MAP-2 almost exclusively in the companion layer is probably related to the unique cytoskeletal structure of this microanatomic layer. Since experimental evidence has shown that the cell cytoskeleton is important to the integrity of the hair follicle, it is probable that MAP-2 expression is also important and disturbances in its expression could play a role in the pathogenesis of some alopecias. MAP-2 may play a similar role in the nail matrix.",

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays a critical role in hair follicle development and skin cancer, but how it controls these processes remains unclear. Of the three Gli transcription factors involved in transducing Shh signals in vertebrates, we demonstrate here that Gli2 is the key mediator of Shh responses in skin. Similar to Shh (-/-) mice, Gli2 (-/-) mutants exhibit an arrest in hair follicle development with reduced cell proliferation and Shh-responsive gene expression, but grossly normal epidermal differentiation. By transgenic rescue experiments, we show that epidermal Gli2 function alone is sufficient to restore hair follicle development in Gli2 (-/-) skin. Furthermore, only a constitutively active form of Gli2, but not wild-type Gli2, can activate Shh-responsive gene expression and promote cell proliferation in Shh (-/-) skin. These observations indicate that Shh-dependent Gli2 activator function in the epidermis is essential for hair follicle development. Our data also reveal that Gli2 mediates the mitogenic effects of Shh by transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 in the developing hair follicles. Together, our results suggest that Shh-dependent Gli2 activation plays a critical role in epithelial homeostasis by promoting proliferation through the transcriptional control of cell cycle regulators.",

In this study we report on the cloning of two novel human type II keratin cDNAs, K6irs3 and K6irs4, which were specifically expressed in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle. Together with the genes of two previously described type II inner root sheath keratins, K6irs1 and K6irs2, the K6irs3 and K6irs4 genes were subclustered in the type II keratin/hair keratin gene domain on chromosome 12q13. Evolutionary tree analysis using all known type II epithelial and hair keratins revealed that the K6irs1-4 formed a branch separate from the other epithelial and hair keratins. RNA in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence studies of human hair follicles, which also included the K6irs2 keratin, demonstrated that both K6irs2 and K6irs3 were specifically expressed in the inner root sheath cuticle, but showed a different onset of expression in this compartment. Whereas the K6irs3 expression began in the lowermost bulb region, that of K6irs2 was delayed up to the height of the apex of the dermal papilla. In contrast, the K6irs4 keratin was specifically expressed in the Huxley layer. Moreover, K6irs4 was ideally suited to further investigate the occurrence of Flugelzellen, i. e., Huxley cells, characterized by horizontal cell extensions that pass through the Henle layer, abut upon the companion layer, and form desmosomal connections with the surrounding cells. Previously, we detected Flugelzellen only in the region along the differentiated Henle layer. Using the Huxley-cell-specific K6irs4 antiserum, we now demonstrate this cell type to be clearly apposed to the entire Henle layer. We provide evidence that Flugelzellen penetrate the Henle layer actively and may play a role in conferring plasticity and resilience to the otherwise rigid upper Henle layer.",

To understand the role Fgf signalling in skin and hair follicle development, we analysed the phenotype of mice deficient for Fgfr2-IIIb and its main ligand Fgf10. These studies showed that the severe epidermal hypoplasia found in mice null for Fgfr2-IIIb is caused by a lack of the basal cell proliferation that normally results in a stratified epidermis. Although at term the epidermis of Fgfr2-IIIb null mice is only two to three cells thick, it expresses the classical markers of epidermal differentiation and establishes a functional barrier. Mice deficient for Fgf10 display a similar but less severe epidermal hypoplasia. By contrast, Fgfr2-IIIb-/-, but not Fgf10-/-, mice produced significantly fewer hair follicles, and their follicles were developmentally retarded. Following transplantation onto nude mice, grafts of Fgfr2-IIIb-/-skin showed impaired hair formation, with a decrease in hair density and the production of abnormal pelage hairs. Expression of Lef1, Shh and Bmp4 in the developing hair follicles of Fgfr2-IIIb-/-mice was similar to wild type. These results suggest that Fgf signalling positively regulates the number of keratinocytes needed to form a normal stratified epidermis and to initiate hair placode formation. In addition, Fgf signals are required for the growth and patterning of pelage hairs.",

The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signalling pathway plays a central role in the development of the skin and hair follicle and is a major determinant of skin tumorigenesis, most notably of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Various mouse models involving either ablation or overexpression of key members of the Shh signalling pathway display a range of skin tumours. To further examine the role of Shh in skin development, we have overexpressed Shh in a subset of interfollicular basal cells from 12. 5 dpc under the control of the human keratin 1 (HK1) promoter. The HK1-Shh transgenic mice display a range of skin anomalies, including highly pigmented inguinal lesions and regions of alopecia. The most striking hair follicle phenotype is a suppression in embryonic follicle development between 14. 0 and 19. 0 dpc, resulting in a complete absence of guard, awl, and auchene hair fibres. These data indicate that alternative signals are responsible for the development of different hair follicles and point to a major role of Shh signalling in the morphogenesis of guard, awl, and auchene hair fibres.

Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we show that BMP receptor IA is essential for the differentiation of progenitor cells of the inner root sheath and hair shaft. Without BMPRIA activation, GATA-3 is down-regulated and its regulated control of IRS differentiation is compromised. In contrast, Lef1 is up-regulated, but its regulated control of hair differentiation is still blocked, and BMPRIA-null follicles fail to activate Lef1/beta-catenin-regulated genes, including keratin genes. Wnt-mediated transcriptional activation can be restored by transfecting BMPRIA-null keratinocytes with a constitutively activated beta-catenin. This places the block downstream from Lef1 expression but upstream from beta-catenin stabilization. Because mice lacking the BMP inhibitor Noggin fail to express Lef1, our findings support a model, whereby a sequential inhibition and then activation of BMPRIA is necessary to define a band of hair progenitor cells, which possess enough Lef1 and stabilized beta-catenin to activate the hair specific keratin genes and generate the hair shaft.",

Furthermore, immunoreactivity for PAR-1 was detected in the DP and lower portion of connective tissue sheath in the anagen and catagen phases and in the DP of telogen hair follicles. Because only a pharmacologic level (100 nM) of thrombin significantly stimulated cell proliferation and DNA synthesis of the cultured dermal papilla cells, thrombin does not seem to have a mitogenic effect on dermal papilla cells physiologically.

When syngeneic skin grafts were exchanged between gender-matched wild-type (WT) and CD200-deficient C57BL/6 mice, significant perifollicular and intrafollicular inflammation was observed, eventually leading to the destruction of virtually all HF (alopecia) without significant loss of the CD200-negative grafts. Minimal and transient inflammation was observed in WT grafts, which persisted long term with hair. There was a 2-fold increase in graft-infiltrating T cells in CD200-deficient skin at 14 d. Alopecia and skin lesions were induced in CD200-deficient hosts by adoptive transfer of splenocytes from WT mice previously grafted with CD200-negative skin, but not from mice grafted with WT skin.

The hair-growth cycle, a complex biological system requiring coordinate alterations in gene expression and cellular behavior, provides a challenging model for investigating the interplay of specific transcriptional regulation events. Here we report that the Barx2 homeodomain factor serves as a regulator of hair follicle remodeling (catagen), and loss of Barx2 in mice causes a defect both in the initiation and progression of catagen, resulting in a protracted first catagen, and later, causing short hair in adult gene-deleted mice. Barx2 negatively regulates its own promoter, and our study highlights the role of Barx2 as a repressor in the skin that can, unexpectedly, functionally interact with two WD40-domain factors distantly related to the yeast corepressor Tup1. These two corepressors, transducin-like enhancer of split and transducin beta-like 1, function through distinct and independent interactions with Barx2 for the repression of gene targets, including the Barx2 gene itself, emphasizing the roles of complementary repression strategies in engrailed homology-1 motif-containing homeodomain factors. Together, our data suggest that the hair-remodeling defect of Barx2 mutant mice could be explained, in part, by failure to repress one or more critical target genes.",

Hair follicles (HFs) are renewed via multipotent stem cells located in a reservoir (the bulge) ; however, little is known about how they generate multi-tissue HFs from a proliferative zone (the matrix). To address this issue, we temporally induced clonal labeling during HF growth. Challenging the prevailing hypothesis, we found that the matrix contains restricted self-renewing stem cells for each inner structure. These cells are located around the dermal papilla forming a germinative layer. They occupy different proximodistal sectors and produce differentiated cells along the matrix radial axis via stereotyped lineages and cell behavior. By contrast, the outer layer of HFs displays a mode of growth involving apoptosis that coordinates the development of outer and inner structures. HF morphology is therefore determined by the organization of cell fates along the proximodistal axis and by cell behavior along the radial (lateral) axis in the matrix. Thus, our studies suggest that fate and behavior are organized by two systems (uncoupled), and this uncoupling may represent a fundamental way to simplify morphogenesis.",

Since the organ-culture of human hair follicles (HF) offers an excellent, clinically relevant model for complex tissue interaction systems, we have asked whether the cannabinoid system plays a role in hair growth control. Here, we show that human scalp HF, intriguingly, are both targets and sources of endocannabinoids. Namely, the endocannabinoid N-arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide, AEA) as well as the exocannabinnoid delta (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol dose-dependently inhibited hair shaft elongation and the proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes, and induced intraepithelial apoptosis and premature HF regression (catagen). These effects were inhibited by a selective antagonist of cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1). In contrast to CB2, CB1 was expressed in a hair cycle-dependent manner in the human HF epithelium. Since we successfully identified the presence of endocannabinoids in human HF, our data strongly suggest that human HF exploit a CB1-mediated endocannabinoid signaling system for negatively regulating their own growth. Clinically, CB1 agonists may therefore help to manage unwanted hair growth, while CB1 antagonists might counteract hair loss. Finally, human HF organ culture offers an instructive, physiologically relevant new research tool for dissecting \" \" nonclassical \" \" effects of endocannabinoids and their receptor-mediated signaling in general. \"",

Using RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC), we found that all receptors were present in hair follicle. This data shed new light on an underestimated complex network involved in hair growth control. Indeed most of these receptors showed a wide spectrum of expression in cultured cells and the whole hair follicle. Using IHC, we observed that expression of prostaglandin E (2) receptors (EP (2), EP (3), EP (4)), prostaglandin D (2) receptor (DP (2)), prostanoid thromboxane A (2) receptor (TP) and to a lesser extent EP (1) involved several hair follicle compartments.

BACKGROUND: CD10 and CD34 have been detected in both epithelial and mesenchymal components of anagen human hair follicles. OBJECTIVES: To analyse the expression of CD10 and CD34 in human hair follicle development as well as in different phases of the hair cycle. METHODS: Fetal and adult hair follicles at different stages of the hair cycle were examined by immunohistochemistry for CD10 and CD34. RESULTS: In fetal follicles, CD10 is expressed by the cells of the placodes, and CD34 by the mesenchymal cells of the dermal condensate. As the follicle matures, CD10 can be seen in the matrix cells, inner root sheath and dermal sheath. In adult follicles, the expression of CD10 in the follicular epithelium is present in anagen follicles, but tends to disappear in catagen, and is not detected in telogen. The CD10 positivity of the dermal sheath is more intense in catagen than in anagen follicles. CD34 immunostaining of the external root sheath was seen in adult anagen follicles but not in fetal follicles. This staining of the anagen outer sheath tends to disappear in catagen and is not detected in telogen. CONCLUSIONS: CD10 and CD34 are not proteins constantly present in a specific cell type of the hair follicle, but are proteins that can be expressed by both epithelial and mesenchymal cells depending on the stage of development and hair cycle. The distribution of the immunoreactivity to CD10 in the placode and CD34 in the dermal condensate suggests a role of these proteins in initial stages of hair formation.",

Fuz, a homologue of the Drosophila PCP effector gene, fuzzy, is critical in ciliogenesis in vertebrates, and is required for the development of a wide range of organs in mice. Here, we report that disruption of the Fuz gene in mice severely blocked the development of hair follicles in the skin. In contrast to the loss of hair follicle polarization in mice deficient in core PCP genes, hair follicles in mice lacking the Fuz gene retained their typical anterior-posterior orientation. We show that disruption of Fuz impaired the formation of primary cilia and the hedgehog signaling pathway in the skin. In addition, using skin grafts and skin reconstitution assays we demonstrate that the expression of Fuz is required in both epidermal and dermal cells and that the formation of primary cilia is a cell-autonomous process that does not require cross talk between the epithelia and mesenchymal compartments during hair follicle formation.",

    "text": "Notch signaling regulates late-stage epidermal differentiation and maintains postnatal hair cycle homeostasis. BACKGROUND: Notch signaling involves ligand-receptor interactions through direct cell-cell contact. Multiple Notch receptors and ligands are expressed in the epidermis and hair follicles during embryonic development and the adult stage. Although Notch signaling plays an important role in regulating differentiation of the epidermis and hair follicles, it remains unclear how Notch signaling participates in late-stage epidermal differentiation and postnatal hair cycle homeostasis. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We applied Cre/loxP system to generate conditional gene targeted mice that allow inactivation of critical components of Notch signaling pathway in the skin. Rbpj, the core component of all four Notch receptors, and Pofut1, an essential factor for ligand-receptor interactions, were inactivated in hair follicle lineages and suprabasal layer of the epidermis using the Tgfb3-Cre mouse line. Rbpj conditional inactivation resulted in granular parakeratosis and reactive epidermal hyperplasia. Pofut1 conditional inactivation led to ultrastructural abnormalities in the granular layer and altered filaggrin processing in the epidermis, suggesting a perturbation of the granular layer differentiation. Disruption of Pofut1 in hair follicle lineages resulted in aberrant telogen morphology, a decrease of bulge stem cell markers, and a concomitant increase of K14-positive keratinocytes in the isthmus of mutant hair follicles. Pofut1-deficent hair follicles displayed a delay in anagen re-entry and dysregulation of proliferation and apoptosis during the hair cycle transition. Moreover, increased DNA double stand breaks were detected in Pofut1-deficent hair follicles, and real time PCR analyses on bulge keratinocytes isolated by FACS revealed an induction of DNA damage response and a paucity of DNA repair machinery in mutant bulge keratinocytes. SIGNIFICANCE: our data reveal a role for Notch signaling in regulating late-stage epidermal differentiation. Notch signaling is required for postnatal hair cycle homeostasis by maintaining proper proliferation and differentiation of hair follicle stem cells.",

Epithelial Ca (2 +)-regulation, which governs cornified envelope formation in the skin epidermis and hair follicles, closely coincides with the expression of S100A3, filaggrin and trichohyalin, and the post-translational modification of these proteins by Ca (2 +)-dependent peptidylarginine deiminases. This review summarizes the current nomenclature and evolutional aspects of S100 Ca (2 +)-binding proteins and S100 fused-type proteins (SFTPs) classified as a separate protein family with special reference to the molecular structure and function of S100A3 dominantly expressed in hair cuticular cells. Both S100 and SFTP family members are identified by two distinct types of Ca (2 +)-binding loops in an N-terminal pseudo EF-hand motif followed by a canonical EF-hand motif. Seventeen members of the S100 protein family including S100A3 are clustered with seven related genes encoding SFTPs on human chromosome 1q21, implicating their association with epidermal maturation and diseases. Human S100A3 is characterized by two disulphide bridges and a preformed Zn (2 +)-pocket, and may transfer Ca (2 +) ions to peptidylarginine deiminases after its citrullination-mediated tetramerization. Phylogenetic analysis utilizing current genome databases suggests that divergence of the S100A3 gene coincided with the emergence of hair, a defining feature of mammals, and that the involvement of S100A3 in epithelial Ca (2 +)-cycling occurred as a result of a skin adaptation in terrestrial mammals.",

Its cells do not keratinize in situ, unlike IRS. We have previously demonstrated that keratinization of the ORS was prevented by contact with the IRS in hair follicle mid-segments (i. e. fragments dissected from skin at the level above the hair bulb and below the opening of the sebaceous gland duct) cultured on agarose layer.

We observed increased Ca (2 +) upregulated expression of involucrin, filaggrin, trichohyalin and Kdap in cultures of bulb-derived cells, but in hair bulbs downregulation of involucrin and trichohyalin was observed. We concluded that the inner root sheath exerts an inhibitory effect on the expression of involucrin and trichohyalin already in the hair bulbs.

We identified a role for MED in KC proliferation and differentiation in cultured KCs. Here, we investigated the in vivo role of MED by generating a conditional null mice model in which a critical subunit of the MED complex, MED1, is deleted from their KCs. The MED1 ablation resulted in aberrant hair differentiation and cycling, leading to hair loss. During the first hair follicle (HF) cycle, MED1 deletion resulted in a rapid regression of the HFs. Hair differentiation was reduced, and beta-catenin/vitamin D receptor (VDR)-regulated gene expression was markedly decreased. In the subsequent adult hair cycle, MED1 ablation activated the initiation of HF cycling. Shh signaling was increased, but terminal differentiation was not sufficient. Deletion of MED1 also caused hyperproliferation of interfollicular epidermal KCs, and increased the expression of epidermal differentiation markers.

We show that prostaglandin D (2) synthase (PTGDS) is elevated at the mRNA and protein levels in bald scalp compared to haired scalp of men with AGA.

Furthermore, we find that a transgenic mouse, K14-Ptgs2, which targets prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 expression to the skin, demonstrates elevated levels of PGD (2) in the skin and develops alopecia, follicular miniaturization, and sebaceous gland hyperplasia, which are all hallmarks of human AGA. These results define PGD (2) as an inhibitor of hair growth in AGA and suggest the PGD (2)-GPR44 pathway as a potential target for treatment.",

Woolly hair (WH) is an abnormal variant of tightly curled hair, which is frequently associated with hypotrichosis. Non-syndromic forms of WH can show either autosomal-dominant WH (ADWH) or autosomal-recessive WH (ARWH) inheritance patterns. ARWH has recently been shown to be caused by mutations in either the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6) or lipase H (LIPH) gene. More recently, a mutation in the keratin K74 (KRT74) gene has been reported to underlie ADWH. Importantly, all of these genes are abundantly expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) of human hair follicles. Besides these findings, the molecular mechanisms underlying hereditary WH have not been fully disclosed. In this study, we identified a Japanese family with ADWH and associated hypotrichosis. After exclusion of known causative genes, we discovered the heterozygous mutation c. 422T > G (p. Phe141Cys) within the helix initiation motif of the IRS-specific keratin K71 (KRT71) gene in affected family members. We demonstrated that the mutant K71 protein led to disruption of keratin intermediate filament formation in cultured cells. To our knowledge, it is previously unreported that the KRT71 mutation is associated with a hereditary hair disorder in humans. Our findings further underscore the crucial role of the IRS-specific keratins in hair follicle development and hair growth in humans.",

Ginger (Zingiber officinale) has been traditionally used to check hair loss and stimulate hair growth in East Asia. Several companies produce shampoo containing an extract of ginger claimed to have anti-hair loss and hair growth promotion properties. However, there is no scientific evidence to back up these claims. This study was undertaken to measure 6-gingerol, the main active component of ginger, on hair shaft elongation in vitro and hair growth in vivo, and to investigate its effect on human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) in vivo and in vitro. 6-Gingerol suppressed hair growth in hair follicles in culture and the proliferation of cultured DPCs. The growth inhibition of DPCs by 6-gingerol in vitro may reflect a decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Similar results were obtained in vivo. The results of this study showed that 6-gingerol does not have the ability to promote hair growth, on the contrary, can suppress human hair growth via its inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects on DPCs in vitro, and can cause prolongation of telogen phase in vivo. Thus, 6-gingerol rather than being a hair growth stimulating drug, it is a potential hair growth suppressive drug ; i. e. for hair removal.",

The hair follicle is a regenerating organ that produces a new hair shaft during each growth cycle. Development and cycling of the hair follicle is governed by interactions between the epithelial and mesenchymal components. Therefore, development of an engineered 3D hair follicle would be useful for studying these interactions to identify strategies for treatment of hair loss. We have developed a technique suitable for assembly of different cell types in close proximity in fibrous hydrogel scaffolds with resolutions of ~ 50 mum. By assembly of dermal papilla (DP) and keratinocytes, structures similar to the native hair bulb arrangement are formed. Gene expression of these constructs showed up-regulation of molecules involved in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions of the hair follicle. Implantation of the follicular structures in SCID mice led to the formation of hair follicle-like structures, thus demonstrating their hair inductive ability. The transparency of the fiber matrix and the small dimensions of the follicular structures allowed the direct quantitation of DP cell proliferation by confocal microscopy, clearly illustrating the promoting or inhibitory effects of hair growth regulating agents.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is not only a cell growth stimulant but also has a catagen-inducing effect. Because chemotherapeutic agents primarily damage anagen hair follicles, it would be important to investigate whether catagen inducers have beneficial effects in chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA). We pretreated hair follicles with topical EGF-liposomal solution in the C57BL/6 mouse model of cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia and observed the catagen-inducing property and damage response pathway after CIA. We confirmed that topical EGF application induced a catagen-like stage and found that these catagen-like hairs were protected from chemotherapy-mediated damage. Moreover, our results showed that EGF treatment favoured primary hair recovery via the dystrophic anagen pathway after CIA. Given that hair follicles subjected to less severe chemotherapeutic insult enter the dystrophic anagen pathway followed by primary recovery, the results of this study suggest that catagen inducers could be useful as a new alopecia-protection strategy, especially in the context of CIA.",

Our purpose is to clarify the physiological role of leptin in hair cycle as leptin reportedly causes activation of Stat3, which is indispensable for hair cycling. While hair follicles in dorsal skin of 5-week-old C57/BL6 mice had progressed to late anagen phase, those in dorsal skin of 5-week-old leptin receptor deficient db/db mice remained in the first telogen and later entered the anagen at postnatal day 40, indicating that deficiency in leptin receptor signalling delayed the second hair cycle progression. Next, we shaved dorsal hairs on wild-type mice at postnatal 7 weeks and injected skin with mouse leptin or a mock. After 20 days, although mock injection showed no effect, hair growth occurred around leptin injection area. Human leptin fragment (aa22-56) had similar effects. Although the hair cycle of ob/ob mice was similar to that of wild-type mice, injection of mouse leptin on ob/ob mice at postnatal 7 weeks induced anagen transition. Immunohistochemically, leptin is expressed in hair follicles from catagen to early anagen in wild-type mice, suggesting that leptin is an anagen inducer in vivo. Phosphorylation of Erk, Jak2 and Stat3 in human keratinocytes was stimulated by leptin and leptin fragment. In addition, RT-PCR and ELISA showed that the production of leptin by human dermal papilla cells increased under hypoxic condition, suggesting that hypoxia in catagen/telogen phase promotes leptin production, preparing for entry into the next anagen. In conclusion, leptin, a well-known adipokine, acts as an anagen inducer and represents a new player in hair biology.",

The largest amounts of FNS were found in the epidermis and in the appendages after application of P-08-016, regardless of the time from application.

In hypothyroid patients the epidermis is thin and alopecia is common, indicating that thyroidal status might influence not only skin proliferation but also hair growth. We demonstrate here that the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) mediate these effects of the thyroid hormones on the skin. Mice lacking TRalpha1 and TRbeta (the main thyroid hormone binding isoforms) display impaired hair cycling associated to a decrease in follicular hair cell proliferation. This was also observed in hypothyroid mice, indicating the important role of the hormone-bound receptors in hair growth. In contrast, the individual deletion of either TRalpha1 or TRbeta did not impair hair cycling, revealing an overlapping or compensatory role of the receptors in follicular cell proliferation. In support of the role of the receptors in hair growth, TRalpha1/TRbeta-deficient mice developed alopecia after serial depilation. These mice also presented a wound-healing defect, with retarded re-epithelialization and wound gaping, associated to impaired keratinocyte proliferation. These results reinforce the idea that the thyroid hormone nuclear receptors play an important role on skin homeostasis and suggest that they could be targets for the treatment of cutaneous pathologies.",

BACKGROUND: Occipital scars from donor strip harvesting during hair transplantation are an important cosmetic concern. Scalp laxity has an important role, due to the more frequent use of dense packing and megasession transplantation, which requires more grafts and creates a wider, longer donor scar. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the use of a simple, objective measurement of occipital scalp laxity could reduce scar length by allowing for adjustment of donor strip harvesting during hair transplantation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study included data from 39 patients who underwent hair transplantation with > 2000 follicular units: 25 patients underwent measurement of occipital scalp laxity (measurement group) ; the other 14 did not (control group). We measured and calculated preoperative scalp parameters for hair transplantation, including follicular unit density at occipital scalp, length and width of the donor strip, and estimated total number of grafts. All patients underwent standard follicular-unit hair transplantation, at which time the actual total number of grafts was determined. RESULTS: Mean occipital follicular unit density in the measurement group was 74. 16 follicles per cm2, which did not significantly differ from the controls (73. 29 ; t = 0. 410, d. f. = 37, P > 0. 05). The mean length of the occipital surgical wound was significantly shorter in the measurement group than in the controls (19. 16 vs 27. 50 cm, respectively ; t = 10. 412, d. f. = 37, P < 0. 05). The difference between the estimated and actual total number of grafts was significant in the measurement group (2139. 44 vs 2397. 64, respectively ; paired t = 3. 095, d. f. = 48, P < 0. 05) but not in the control group (2277. 71 vs 2296. 71, respectively ; paired t = 0. 175, d. f. = 26, P > 0. 05). Accuracy in estimating the total number of grafts was poor for the measurement group, as the number of actual grafts significantly exceeded estimates. CONCLUSION: Use of data from a simple, objective method to measure occipital scalp laxity simplified adjustment of strip harvesting, allowed for use of wider strips, and resulted in smaller donor wounds and scars from hair transplantation ; however, accuracy in estimating the total number of grafts was reduced.",

METHODS: During November 2006 to November 2011, follicular unit extraction (FUE) transplantation using NPA hair was conducted in 128 patients following a shave test involving the visual evaluation of hair density and caliber of shaved head donor areas. The test was used to determine permanent versus nonpermanent donor areas. A questionnaire was sent to patients to assess satisfaction with their restored hairlines, with a follow-up questionnaire sent to those who initially responded. RESULTS: Three-quarters of patients are good candidates for use of NPA hair to the hairlines and temples based on the shave test. Of 128 patients transplanted, 71% responded and reported a mean overall satisfaction of 8. 3 (scale, 1-10). Patients saw full hair coverage at the recipient area at a mean of 9. 6 months after surgery. Nineteen patients reported lost grafts. Thirty-three patients responded to a second survey and reported a mean overall satisfaction of 8. 5 at an average of 4. 6 years after surgery ; only 5 (15%) new instances of graft loss were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Soft, natural-looking hairlines can be created in select patients using NPA hair as a donor source by FUE hair transplantation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Therapeutic.",

    "text": "TR3 is preferentially expressed by bulge epithelial stem cells in human hair follicles. TR3 is an orphan member of the steroid/thyroid/retinoid nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors and it plays a pivotal role in regulating cell growth and apoptosis. The expression and function of TR3 in skin have not been well investigated. Using a cDNA expression assay, we discover that TR3 is significantly enriched in human telogen bulge compared with anagen bulb. Immunohistochemical staining confirms that TR3 is highly expressed in the bulge region of human hair follicles and it colocalizes with cytokeratin 15 (K15), an epithelial stem cell marker. To study the function of TR3 in the effect of androgens in keratinocytes, we treat HaCaT keratinocytes and primary human keratinocytes with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and testosterone (T). The treated keratinocytes show a dose-dependent growth reduction to DHT and T. DHT increases the expression of TR3 in keratinocytes, associated with a concomitant increase of BAD and decrease of Bcl-2 expression. Knockdown TR3 expression by siRNA blocks the inhibitory effect of DHT on keratinocyte proliferation. Our results demonstrate that TR3 is localized to the stem cell compartment in the human hair follicles. Androgen increases TR3 expression in cultured keratinocytes. Our data suggest that TR3 mediates at least part of the inhibitory effect of androgens on keratinocytes.",

BACKGROUND: The distinction between chronic telogen effluvium (CTE) and female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is important because of their different prognosis and treatment. Non-invasive methods have been described to be useful in differentiating FPHL from CTE. This prospective study investigated the use of the washing method to differentiate CTE from mild FPHL. METHODS: Twenty patients with CTE and 17 with FPHL were recruited and followed for 18 months. The diagnosis was established through clinical, laboratory, and histological studies. The patients were asked to abstain from washing their hair for 5 days and then shampoo and collect all hair shed in the process. Hair shafts were then counted and divided into two groups: up to 3 cm in length or longer. RESULTS: In the CTE group, the mean hair count was high (438), and in all cases, < 10% were short. In patients with FPHL, the mean count was not as high (215) and in only one patient, short hairs comprised < 10% of the total. The greater the number of long hairs, the higher was the density of terminal follicles seen histologically. The CTE group presented a greater number of patients with serum iron values < 70 mug/dl. Ferritin levels ranged from 6. 98 to 128. 33, average of 66. 65 (CTE), and 16. 5-304. 8, average of 114. 97 ng/ml (FPHL), but no significant differences were found. CONCLUSION: The washing test can be useful to avoid biopsy procedures. Iron serum levels are possibly an additional parameter that may improve CTE diagnosis if combined with an earlier test.",

    "text": "Dermal adipocytes and hair cycling: is spatial heterogeneity a characteristic feature of the dermal adipose tissue depot ? Adipocytes are widely distributed in the dermis, in a unique fat depot referred to as dermal white adipose tissue (dWAT). In rodents, dWAT is present as widespread thin layers, whereas in pigs and humans, it is present in clusters referred to as ' dermal cones ' around the pilosebaceous units. This distinct layer of fat cells located above the subcutaneous white adipose tissue is important for proper hair follicle (HF) cycling in rodents. Murine HFs produce spatially restricted synchronous patches after their second postnatal cycle which correlates with the spatial heterogeneity of murine dWAT. Similarly, the cycling of HFs in humans may also be related to the spatial distribution of dWAT, making the difference between murine and human HF cycling of more quantitative than of qualitative nature. This should allow the production of small spatially correlated HF patches in human skin, and we propose that this process can be regulated by paracrine signalling involving a number of signalling modules, including the hedgehog pathway. This pathway is an established player in HF cycling, but is also involved in the regulation of adipogenesis and may therefore be a key regulator of the process across species. We also suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of dWAT is connected not only to HF cycling, but may also be related to other physiological and pathological processes in the skin.",

    "text": "Tight junctions form a barrier in porcine hair follicles. Follicular penetration has gained increasing interest regarding (i) safety concerns about (environmentally born) xenobiotics available to the hair follicle (HF), e. g. nanomaterials or allergens which should not enter the skin, and (ii) the possibility for non-invasive follicular drug and antigen delivery. However, not much is known about barriers in the HF which have to be surpassed upon uptake and/or penetration into surrounding tissue. Thus, aim of this work was a detailed investigation of this follicular barrier function, as well as particle uptake into the HF of porcine skin which is often used as a model system for human skin for such purposes. We show that follicular tight junctions (TJs) form a continuous barrier from the infundibulum down to the suprabulbar region, complementary to the stratum corneum in the most exposed upper follicular region, but remaining as the only barrier in the less accessible lower follicular regions. In the bulbar region of the HF no TJ barrier was found, demonstrating the importance of freely supplying this hair-forming part with e. g. nutrients or hormones from the dermal microenvironment. Moreover, the dynamic character of the follicular TJ barrier was shown by modulating its permeability using EDTA. After applying polymeric model-nanoparticles (154 nm) to the skin, transmission electron microscopy revealed that the majority of the particles were localized in the upper part of the HF where the double-barrier is present. Only few penetrated deeper, reaching regions where TJs act as the only barrier, and no particles were observed in the bulbar, barrier-less region. Lastly, the equivalent expression and distribution of TJ proteins in human and porcine HF further supports the suitability of porcine skin as a predictive model to study the follicular penetration and further biological effects of dermally applied nanomaterials in humans.",

BACKGROUND: Arachidonic acid (AA) is an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid present in all mammalian cell membranes, and involved in the regulation of many cellular processes, including cell survival, angiogenesis, and mitogenesis. The dermal papilla, composed of specialized fibroblasts located in the bulb of the hair follicle, contributes to the control of hair growth and the hair cycle. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of AA on hair growth by using in vivo and in vitro models. METHODS: The effect of AA on human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and hair shaft elongation was evaluated by MTT assay and hair follicle organ culture, respectively. The expression of various growth and survival factors in hDPCs were investigated by western blot or immunohistochemistry. The ability of AA to induce and prolong anagen phase in C57BL/6 mice was analyzed. RESULTS: AA was found to enhance the viability of hDPCs and promote the expression of several factors responsible for hair growth, including fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7) and FGF-10. Western blotting identified the role of AA in the phosphorylation of various transcription factors (ERK, CREB, and AKT) and increased expression of Bcl-2 in hDPCs. In addition, AA significantly promoted hair shaft elongation, with increased proliferation of matrix keratinocytes, during ex vivo hair follicle culture. It was also found to promote hair growth by induction and prolongation of anagen phase in telogen-stage C57BL/6 mice. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that AA plays a role in promoting hair growth by increasing the expression of growth factors in hDPCs and enhancing follicle proliferation and survival.",

Wave patterns in lambskin hair follicles are an important factor determining the quality of sheep ' s wool. Hair follicles in lambskin from Hu sheep, a breed unique to China, have 3 types of waves, designated as large, medium, and small. The quality of wool from small wave follicles is excellent, while the quality of large waves is considered poor. Because no molecular and biological studies on hair follicles of these sheep have been conducted to date, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of different wave patterns is currently unknown. The aim of this article was to screen the candidate microRNAs (miRNA) and genes for the development of hair follicles in Hu sheep. Two-day-old Hu lambs were selected from full-sib individuals that showed large, medium, and small waves. Integrated analysis of microRNA and mRNA expression profiles employed high-throughout sequencing technology. Approximately 13, 24, and 18 differentially expressed miRNAs were found between small and large waves, small and medium waves, and medium and large waves, respectively. A total of 54, 190, and 81 differentially expressed genes were found between small and large waves, small and medium waves, and medium and large waves, respectively, by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Differentially expressed genes were classified using gene ontology and pathway analyses. They were found to be mainly involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, growth, immune response, and ion transport, and were associated with MAPK and the Notch signaling pathway. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses of differentially-expressed miRNA and genes were consistent with sequencing results. Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression indicated that, compared to small waves, large waves included 4 downregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 8 upregulated genes and 3 upregulated miRNAs, which in turn influenced 13 downregulated genes. Compared to small waves, medium waves included 13 downregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 64 upregulated genes and 4 upregulated miRNAs, which in turn had regulatory effects on 22 downregulated genes. Compared to medium waves, large waves consisted of 13 upregulated miRNAs that had regulatory effects on 48 downregulated genes. These differentially expressed miRNAs and genes may play a significant role in forming different patterns, and provide evidence for the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of hair follicles of varying patterns.",

The mammalian hair follicle (HF) is a unique, highly regenerative organ with a distinct developmental cycle. Cashmere goat (Capra hircus) HFs can be divided into two categories based on structure and development time: primary and secondary follicles. To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the primary and secondary HFs of cashmere goats, the RNA sequencing of six individuals from Arbas, Inner Mongolia, was performed. A total of 617 DEGs were identified ; 297 were upregulated while 320 were downregulated. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the main functions of the upregulated genes were electron transport, respiratory electron transport, mitochondrial electron transport, and gene expression. The downregulated genes were mainly involved in cell autophagy, protein complexes, neutrophil aggregation, and bacterial fungal defense reactions. According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, these genes are mainly involved in the metabolism of cysteine and methionine, RNA polymerization, and the MAPK signaling pathway, and were enriched in primary follicles. A microRNA-target network revealed that secondary follicles are involved in several important biological processes, such as the synthesis of keratin-associated proteins and enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis. In summary, these findings will increase our understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms of HF development and cycling, and provide a basis for the further study of the genes and functions of HF development.",

By investigating the influence of gene modification on the phenotypes of Cas9-mediated goats, we herein demonstrate that the utility of this approach involving the disruption of FGF5 results in increased number of second hair follicles and enhanced fiber length in Cas9-mediated goats, suggesting more cashmere will be produced. The effects of genome modifications were characterized using H & E and immunohistochemistry staining, quantitative PCR, and western blotting techniques. These results indicated that the gene modifications induced by the disruption of FGF5 had occurred at the morphological and genetic levels. We further show that the knockout alleles were likely capable of germline transmission, which is essential for goat population expansion.

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is the dominant member of the SCD-isozyme family, regarded as a major regulator of lipid and energy metabolism in liver and adipose tissue. SCD1 deficiency impairs the desaturation of de novo-synthesized palmitoyl-and stearoyl-CoA to palmitoleoyl-and oleoyl-CoA. Scd1-/-mice develop metabolic waste syndrome and skin lesions: epidermal barrier disruption, alopecia, and degeneration of sebaceous glands. The unifying molecular link between the two divergent traits remains incompletely understood. Here we show the absence of palmitoleic acid (9Z-16: 1) in the lipidome of the scd1-null mouse, which prohibits posttranslational O-palmitoleoylation of Wnt3a protein, essential for Wnt3a/ss-catenin signaling in stem cell lineage decision in development of the epidermal barrier, hair growth cycle, and sebaceous glands. Substitution of the disrupted epidermal lipid barrier by an inert hydrocarbon coat prevents excessive transepidermal water loss, normalizes thermogenesis and metabolic parameters, and surprisingly leads to the activation of hair bulge progenitor cells and reprograming of a regular hair growth cycle and development of a regular fur in scd1-/-mice. Progenitor sebocytes are not activated. Independent of age, application or removal of the artificial lipid barrier allows the reversible telogen-anagen reentry and exit of the hair growth cycle.",

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of follicular hair transplantation and mini punch graft in the treatment of stable vitiligo. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with stable vitiligo were included in this comparative study. A single patch from each patient was divided into two halves: one half was treated by punch graft, while the other half was treated by follicular hair transplantation followed by excimer light twice weekly, and the outcome was assessed at 0, 1, 3 and 6 months post operatively by photography and quartile scale. RESULTS: At the final visit, the percentage of improvement of vitiligo in punch graft-treated side was significantly higher than that in follicular hair transplantation-treated side (p < 0. 05). Also, repigmentation after punch grafting occurred after a mean period of 2. 5 +-0. 5 weeks (range, 2-3 weeks), while after follicular hair transplantation, repigmentation occurred after 5. 2 +-1. 9 weeks (range, 5-8 weeks) (p < 0. 05). Cobblestone appearance was the most common complication after punch graft ; it occurred in 29 patients (90%), while no reported side effects occurred after follicular graft technique. CONCLUSION: Punch grafting is more effective than follicular grafting in the treatment of stable vitiligo ; however, follicular hair transplantation is cosmetically better, so we recommend it in exposed areas as face.",

HYPOTHESIS: Gold nanoparticles (GNP) are considered an ideal model to help understanding the nano-skin interface. The surface functionality of gold nanorods (GNR) is expected to influence the uptake of nanoparticles into specific targets of skin such as hair follicles or dermis. Hence, it should be possible to modify the surface chemistry of GNP to achieve more targeted and safe skin therapy. EXPERIMENTS: GNR functionalized with various surface ligands (neutral, anionic, cationic, and hydrophobic) were evaluated for their accumulation into hair follicles of human skin sheets using ex-vivo setup. The extent of GNR accumulation into hair follicles and other skin compartments was quantified by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and their spatial distribution through skin layers was investigated by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS). RESULTS: The lipophilic properties of sebum-rich hair follicles enhanced the accumulation of hydrophobic polystyrene (PS)-GNR into hair follicles (~ 13% of the total applied dose), while neutral polyethylene glycol (PEG)-GNR were distributed into all skin compartments, especially the dermis (~ 11. 5% of the total applied dose), which exhibits hydrophilic characteristics. Charged GNR showed a negligible percentage of penetration into any of the skin compartments. GNR could be a promising approach for targeted skin disease treatment and transdermal administration of drugs and therapy.",

Extracts were prepared from dried P. frutescens suspended in distilled water, where the resultant aqueous suspension was fractionated sequentially using hexane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, and distilled water. We observed that the n-butanol fraction resulted in the highest hair regrowth activity. The n-butanol soluble fraction of P. frutescens extract (BFPE) was further separated using AB-8 macroporous resin and silica gel chromatography to obtain rosmarinic acid (RA), which demonstrated effective hair growth regeneration potential. BFPE also showed in vivo anti-androgenic activity following the use of a hair growth assay in testosterone-sensitive male C57Bl/6NCrSlc mice. Furthermore, the effects of cell viability promotion were investigated following an in vitro analysis in primary hair follicle fibroblast cells (PHFCs) treated with RA.

Vismodegib (also known as GDC-0449) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway currently approved for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in humans. Its tumorigenic potential was assessed in dedicated carcinogenicity studies in rasH2 transgenic (Tg. rasH2) mice and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Tumorigenicity potential of vismodegib was identified in rats only and was limited to benign hair follicle tumors, including pilomatricomas and keratoacanthomas at exposures of > = 0. 1-fold and > = 0. 6-fold, respectively, of the steady-state exposure (AUC0-24h) of the recommended human dose. No malignant tumors were identified in either species. Overall, the totality of pharmacology and nonclinical safety data (lack of genotoxicity, in vitro secondary pharmacological binding, and immunoregulatory effects, and limited effects on the endocrine system) suggests that the development of the benign hair follicle tumors may be related to pharmacologically-mediated disruption of hair follicle morphogenesis, although the exact mechanism of tumorigenesis is unclear.

The advent of organotypic skin models advanced the understanding of complex mechanisms of keratinocyte differentiation. However, these models are limited by both availability of primary keratinocytes and donor variability. Keratinocytes derived from cultured hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis were immortalized by ectopic expression of SV40 and hTERT. The generated keratinocyte cell lines differentiated into stratified epidermis with well-defined stratum granulosum and stratum corneum in organotypic human skin models. They behaved comparable to primary keratinocytes regarding the expression of differentiation-associated proteins, cell junction components and proteins associated with cornification and formed a barrier against biotin diffusion. Mechanistically, we found that SV40 large T-antigen expression, accompanied by a strong p53 accumulation, was only detectable in the basal layer of the in vitro reconstructed epidermis. Inhibition of DNA-methylation resulted in expression of SV40 large T-antigen also in the suprabasal epidermal layers and led to incomplete differentiation of keratinocyte cell lines. Our study demonstrates the generation of keratinocyte cell lines which are able to fully differentiate in an organotypic skin model. Since hair follicles, as source for keratinocytes, can be obtained by minimally invasive procedures, our approach enables the generation of cell lines also from individuals not available for skin biopsies.",

OBJECTIVES: Non-invasive visualization of hair follicles is important for proper diagnosis and management of alopecia ; however, histological assessment remains the gold standard. Laser imaging technologies have made possible noninvasive in vivo evaluation of skin and hair follicle. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) to non-invasively identify morphological features that can distinguish scarring from non-scarring alopecia. METHODS: MPM images were obtained from areas on the scalp affected by alopecia. Investigators blinded to the diagnosis analyzed hair follicle and shaft sizes. Patients were recruited and imaged at the UC Irvine Health Medical Center and the University of California, Irvine Beckman Laser Institute. Patients with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and alopecia areata (AA), and scarring alopecia, in particular frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) were recruited and imaged from July 2016 to July 2017. RESULTS: We imaged 5 normal scalp subjects and 12 patients affected by non-scarring (7 subjects) and scarring (5 subjects) alopecia. In normal and non-scarring alopecia patients, MPM identified presence of sebaceous glands associated with hair follicles. MPM images of scarring alopecia were characterized by the presence of inflammatory cells surrounding hair follicles. Measurements of hair follicle diameter sizes were found to be significantly smaller in scarring alopecia patients compared to normal (P < 0. 001) and compared to non-scarring alopecia patients (P = 0. 046) ; non-scarring hair follicles were also significantly smaller than normal hair follicles (P = 0. 043). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that MPM imaging can non-invasively identify morphological features that distinguish scarring from non-scarring alopecia. Further studies are needed to validate this technique and evaluate its potential to be used as an aid for guiding treatment. Lasers Surg. Med. 51: 95-103, 2019. 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

METHODS: A cross-sectional study of the ultrasound images of patients with HS was conducted and compared with a healthy control group. Detection and identification of early subclinical ultrasound signs in the lesional and perilesional areas of the HS cases in comparison with the control group were performed. Statistical analyses included mean, dispersion measures, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and bivariate and multivariate ordered logistic regression studies. Significance was assessed at P <. 05. RESULTS: A total of 139 patients with HS met the criteria and showed abnormalities of the hair follicles such as a curved shape, ballooning, and protrusion into pseudocysts, collections, or tunnels (donor of keratin sign). Significant increases in the sizes of the hair follicles and hair shafts were found in HS cases. The following ultrasound signs were significantly linked to severity: a connecting band between the base of adjacent hair follicles (bridge sign), a fragment of the hair shaft extruding through a dilated hair follicle (sword sign), and retained cylindrical fragments of keratin in the dermis. Two patterns of fragmentation of the keratin were detected: multifragment and cylindrical. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound can detect early HS signs that are significantly linked to severity and 2 types of fragmentation of the keratin, which could support the generation and perpetuation of the fluid collections and tunnels.

Background: Male-type baldness is a common chronic hair loss disorder among males. Male type baldness is characterized by stepwise miniaturization of the hair follicle, due to alteration in the hair cycle dynamics, leading to transformation of the terminal hair follicle into a vellus one. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) seems to be a new technique which may improve hair regrowth. We planned a randomized, double-blinded placebo control trial to see the efficacy of PRP with and without topical minoxidil and to compare with placebo and standard treatment. Materials and Methods: The study design was a randomized, double-blind placebo control trial. The sample size was calculated, and randomization was done. Patients with male type baldness were allocated into four groups ; first group topical minoxidil only, the second group PRP with minoxidil, the third group normal saline (NS), and fourth group PRP only.

Despite advances in medical treatments, the proportion of the population suffering from alopecia is increasing, thereby creating a need for new treatments to control hair loss and prevent balding. Human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (hDPCs), a type of specialized fibroblast in the hair bulb, play an essential role in controlling hair growth and in conditions like androgenic alopecia. This study aimed to evaluate the intensity-dependent effect of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) on the expression of anagen-related molecules in hDPCs in vitro. We examined the effect of ELF-EMF on hDPCs to determine whether activation of the GSK-3beta/ERK/Akt signaling pathway improved hDPC activation and proliferation ; hDPCs were exposed to ELF-EMFs at a frequency of 70 Hz and at intensities ranging from 5 to 100 G, over four days. Various PEMF intensities significantly increased the expression of anagen-related molecules, including collagen IV, laminin, ALP, and versican. In particular, an intensity of 10 G is most potent for promoting the proliferation of hDPC and expression of anagen-related molecules. Moreover, 10 G ELF-EMF significantly increased beta-catenin and Wnt3alpha expression and GSK-3beta/ERK/Akt phosphorylation. Our results confirmed that ELF-EMFs enhance hDPC activation and proliferation via the GSK-3beta/ERK/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting a potential treatment strategy for alopecia.",

    "text": "Toward Predicting the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Alopecia Areata Lesions Using Partial Differential Equation Analysis. Hair loss in the autoimmune disease, alopecia areata (AA), is characterized by the appearance of circularly spreading alopecic lesions in seemingly healthy skin. The distinct spatial patterns of AA lesions form because the immune system attacks hair follicle cells that are in the process of producing hair shaft, catapults the mini-organs that produce hair from a state of growth (anagen) into an apoptosis-driven regression state (catagen), and causes major hair follicle dystrophy along with rapid hair shaft shedding. In this paper, we develop a model of partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of immune system components that clinical and experimental studies show are primarily involved in the disease development. Global linear stability analysis reveals there is a most unstable mode giving rise to a pattern. The most unstable mode indicates a spatial scale consistent with results of the humanized AA mouse model of Gilhar et al. (Autoimmun Rev 15 (7): 726-735, 2016) for experimentally induced AA lesions. Numerical simulations of the PDE system confirm our analytic findings and illustrate the formation of a pattern that is characteristic of the spatio-temporal AA dynamics. We apply marginal linear stability analysis to examine and predict the pattern propagation.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Search of PubMed, trade publications, and printed references. RESULTS: Follicular unit excision and FUT methods provide high-quality grafts, but differ in their scarring patterns of the donor region. Follicular unit transplantation results in a linear scar, whereas FUE produces punctate scars that are typically easily concealed. Distinct subgroups of hair transplant patients are eligible for FUE, FUT, or both procedures. CONLCUSION: Both FUE and FUT are equally effective in generating high-quality grafts.

Chemotherapy-induced hair loss (alopecia) (CIA) remains a major unsolved problem in clinical oncology. CIA is often considered to be a consequence of the antimitotic and apoptosis-promoting properties of chemotherapy drugs acting on rapidly proliferating hair matrix keratinocytes. Here, we show that in a mouse model of CIA, the downregulation of Shh signaling in the hair matrix is a critical early event. Inhibition of Shh signaling recapitulated key morphological and functional features of CIA, whereas recombinant Shh protein partially rescued hair loss. Phosphoproteomics analysis revealed that activation of the MAPK pathway is a key upstream event, which can be further manipulated to rescue CIA. Finally, in organ-cultured human scalp hair follicles as well as in patients undergoing chemotherapy, reduced expression of SHH gene correlates with chemotherapy-induced hair follicle damage or the degree of CIA, respectively. Our work revealed that Shh signaling is an evolutionarily conserved key target in CIA pathobiology. Specifically targeting the intrafollicular MAPK-Shh axis may provide a promising strategy to manage CIA.",

The present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of quercitrin, a major constituent of Hottuynia cordata extract, for its hair growth stimulating activities in cultured human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs). Quercitrin enhanced the cell viability and cellular energy metabolism in cultured hDPCs by stimulating the production of NAD (P) H and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi). The expression of Bcl2, an essential marker for anagen hair follicle and cell survival, was increased by quercitrin treatment. Quercitrin also increased the cell proliferation marker Ki67. The expression of growth factors-such as bFGF, KGF, PDGF-AA, and VEGF-were increased by quercitrin both in mRNA and protein levels. In addition, quercitrin was found to increase the phosphorylation of Akt, Erk, and CREB in cultured hDPCs, while inhibitors of MAPKs reversed the effects of quercitrin. Finally, quercitrin stimulated hair shaft growth in cultured human hair follicles. Our data obtained from present study are in line with those previously reported and demonstrate that quercitrin is (one of) the active compound (s) of Hottuynia cordata extract which showed hair growth promoting effects. It is strongly suggested that the hair growth stimulating activity of quercitrin was exerted by enhancing the cellular energy metabolism, increasing the production of growth factors via activation of MAPK/CREB signaling pathway.",

Here, we demonstrate that epithelial stem cells of non-skin origin (e. g. that of cornea, oesophagus, vagina, bladder, prostate) that express the transcription factor Tp63, a master gene for the development of epidermis and its appendages, can respond to skin morphogenetic signals. When exposed to a newborn skin microenvironment, these cells express hair-follicle lineage markers and contribute to hair follicles, sebaceous glands and/or epidermis renewal. Our results demonstrate that lineage restriction is not immutable and support the notion that all Tp63-expressing epithelial stem cells, independently of their embryonic origin, have latent skin competence explaining why aberrant hair follicles or sebaceous glands are sometimes observed in non-skin tissues (e. g. in cornea, vagina or thymus).",

Wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN) has been an important model to study hair follicle regeneration during wound repair. However, the cellular and molecular components of the dermis that make large wounds more regenerative are not fully understood. Here, we compare and contrast recently published scRNA-seq data of small scarring wounds to wounds that regenerate in hope to elucidate the role of fibroblasts lineages in WIHN. Our analysis revealed an over-representation of the newly identified upper wound fibroblasts in regenerative wound conditions, which express the retinoic acid binding protein Crabp1. This regenerative cell type shares a similar gene signature to the murine papillary fibroblast lineage, which are necessary to support hair follicle morphogenesis and homeostasis. RNA velocity analysis comparing scarring and regenerating wounds revealed the divergent trajectories towards upper and lower wound fibroblasts and that the upper populations were closely associated with the specialized dermal papilla. We also provide analyses and explanation reconciling the inconsistency between the histological lineage tracing and the scRNA-seq data from recent reports investigating large wounds. Finally, we performed a computational test to map the spatial location of upper wound fibroblasts in large wounds which revealed that upper peripheral fibroblasts might harbour equivalent regenerative competence as those in the centre. Overall, our scRNA-seq reanalysis combining multiple samples suggests that upper wound fibroblasts are required for hair follicle regeneration and that papillary fibroblasts may migrate from the wound periphery to the centre during wound re-epithelialization.

Hair follicles (HFs) are important drug delivery targets for the therapy of miscellaneous skin diseases and for skin antisepsis. Furthermore, HFs significantly contribute to drug delivery of topically applied substances. Nanoparticulate systems are excellently suited for follicular drug delivery as they entail the opportunity of directed drug transport into HFs. Moreover, they involve the possibility of an intrafollicular drug release initiated by extrinsic or intrinsic trigger mechanisms. In this study, we present a novel preclinical model for an anatomically and temporally targeted intrafollicular drug release. In vitro release kinetics of the model drug sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) from newly synthesized ultraviolet A (UVA)-responsive polyurethane nanocapsules (NCs) were investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. Low power density UVA radiation provided by a UVA light emitting diode (LED) induced a drug release of over 50% after 2 min. We further utilized confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to investigate follicular penetration as well as intrafollicular drug release on an ex vivo porcine ear skin model. UVA-responsive degradation of the NCs at a mean follicular penetration depth of 509 +-104 microm ensured liberation of SR101 in the right place and at the right time. Thus, for the first time a UVA-triggered drug release from NCs within HFs was demonstrated in the present study. Cytotoxicity tests revealed that NCs synthesized with isophorone diisocyanate show sufficient biocompatibility after UVA-induced cleavage. A considerable and controllable release of various water-soluble therapeutics could be reached by means of the presented system without risking any radiation-related tissue damage. Therefore, the implementation of the presented system into clinical routine, e. g. for preoperative antisepsis of HFs, appears very promising.",

DNA methylation status is considered a promising method to infer tissue age by virtue of age-dependent changes on methylation sites. In recent years, forensic scientists have established various models to predict the chronological age of blood, saliva, and semen based on DNA methylation status. However, hair-inferred age has not been studied in the field of forensic science. In this study, we measured the methylation statuses of potential age-related CpG sites by using the multiplex methylation SNaPshot method. A total of 10 CpG sites from the LAG3, SCGN, ELOVL2, KLF14, C1orf132, SLC12A5, GRIA2, and PDE4C genes were found to be tightly associated with age in hair follicles. A correlation coefficient above 0. 7 was found for four CpG sites (cg24724428 and Chr6: 11044628 in ELOVL2, cg25148589 in GRIA2, and cg07547549 in SLC12A5). Among four age-prediction models, the multiple linear regression model consisting of 10 CpG sites provided the best-fitting results, with a median absolute deviation of 3. 68 years. It is feasible to obtain both human identification and age information from a single scalp hair follicle. No significant differences in methylation degree were found between different sexes, hair types, or hair colors.

Objectives: To investigate the trichoscopic features of female pattern hair loss (FPHL) in Chinese Han patients and analyze the difference between male and female patients with FPHL. Materials and Methods: Trichoscopic images were taken in four different scalp areas, including right frontal hairline, vertex, right parietal and occipital areas. Hair density, hair shaft diameter, vellus hair ratio and single hair follicle unit ratio were counted manually and analyzed. Results: Seventy-three subjects were enrolled in this study, including 38 patients with FPHL (28 females and 10 males) and 35 normal controls without hair loss. The hair density and hair shaft diameter of FPHL patients reduced in the whole scalp. Vellus hair ratio and single hair follicle unit ratio were both increased in FPHL compared to normal controls. The vertex was the most affected area and the hair shaft diameter showed the most significant difference. Parietal and occipital area were also affected in FPHL. The reduction or increase was correlated with the severity of Ludwig staging. Very few gender differences were detected in male and female FPHL patients. Conclusion: FPHL patients showed decreased hair density and hair shaft diameter, accompanied by increased vellus hair ratio and single hair follicle unit ratio. Parietal and occipital area can be also affected in FPHL, though not as severe as in vertex area. FPHL in male basically has the same characteristic as those in female patients.

There is an unmet need for novel, non-pharmacological therapeutics to treat alopecia. Recent studies have shown the potential biological benefits of non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma (NTAPP), including wound healing, angiogenesis, and the proliferation of stem cells. We hypothesized that NTAPP might have a stimulatory effect on hair growth or regeneration. We designed an NTAPP-generating apparatus which is applicable to in vitro and in vivo experiments. The human dermal papilla (DP) cells, isolated fresh hair follicles, and mouse back skin were exposed with the NTAPP. Biological outcomes were measured using RNA-sequencing, RT-PCR, Western blots, and immunostaining. The NTAPP treatment increased the expression levels of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related genes (AMER3, CCND1, LEF1, and LRG1) and proteins (beta-catenin, p-GSK3beta, and cyclin D1) in human DP cells. In contrast, inhibitors of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, endo-IWR1 and IWP2, attenuated the levels of cyclin D1, p-GSK3beta, and beta-catenin proteins induced by NTAPP. Furthermore, we observed that NTAPP induced the activation of beta-catenin in DP cells of hair follicles and the mRNA levels of target genes of the beta-catenin signaling pathway (CCND1, LEF1, and TCF4). NTAPP-treated mice exhibited markedly increased anagen induction, hair growth, and the protein levels of beta-catenin, p-GSK3beta, p-AKT, and cyclin D1. NTAPP stimulates hair growth via activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in DP cells. These findings collectively suggest that NTAPP may be a potentially safe and non-pharmacological therapeutic intervention for alopecia.",

RESULTS: Five of the 8 hormones had a high concentration in the parietal region, with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) showing a peak in the central parietal region (z = 1. 59) suggesting a correlation with AGA ' s clinical presentation. Whereas, no significant differences were observed for testosterone and cortisol between the parietal and occipital regions.

    "text": "Overexpression of miR-122 promotes apoptosis of dermal papilla cells by directly targeting IGF1R in androgenetic alopecia. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common pattern of hair loss resulting from the effects of androgen on hair follicle. MicroRNAs (miRs) serve imperative roles in the regulation of many biological processes of hair follicle. However, the exact molecular mechanism of AGA remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we found miR-122, which is mainly recognized as a tumor suppressor, was highly overexpressed in the bulb of balding HFs in comparison with non-balding ones in AGA. Moreover, miR-122 induces apoptosis of human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) with miR-122 mimics in vitro, and the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) in hDPCs was reduced following upregulation of miR-122. Mechanistically, dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-122 directly targeted the 3 '-untranslated region of IGF1R. These findings suggested that upregulation of miR-122 induces apoptosis, potentially via the repression of IGF1R in hDPCs of AGA, providing a novel insight into the potential pathological mechanism of miR-122 in AGA DPCs.

    "text": "Hair Growth Promoting Effects of 650 nm Red Light Stimulation on Human Hair Follicles and Study of Its Mechanisms via RNA Sequencing Transcriptome Analysis. Background: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) leads to thinning of scalp hair and affects 60% ~ 70% of the adult population worldwide. Developing more effective treatments and studying its mechanism are of great significance. Previous clinical studies have revealed that hair growth is stimulated by 650-nm red light. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of 650-nm red light on the treatment of AGA by using ex vivo hair follicle culture. Methods: Human hair follicles were obtained from hair transplant patients with AGA. Hair follicles were cultured in Williams E medium and treated with or without 650-nm red light. Real-time RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect the expression level of genes and proteins in hair follicles, respectively. RNA-sequencing analysis was carried out to reveal the distinct gene signatures upon 650 nm treatment. Results: Low-level 650 nm red light promoted the proliferation of human hair follicles in the experimental cultured-tissue model. Consistently, 650 nm red light significantly delayed the transition of hair cycle from anagen to catagen in vitro. RNA-seq analysis and gene clustering for the differentially expressed genes suggests that leukocyte transendothelial migration, metabolism, adherens junction and other biological process maybe involved in stimulation of hair follicles by 650-nm red light treatment. Conclusion: The effect of 650-nm red light on ex vivo hair follicles and the transcriptome set which implicates the role of red light in promoting hair growth and reversing of miniaturization process of AGA were identified.",

As a polyphenolic phytoalexin, resveratrol (RSV) is known as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agent. OBJECTIVE: Thus, we aim to examine the effects of RSV on hair growth. METHODS: In vivo C57BL/6 mice were used to evaluate the effects of RSV on hair cycle, hair length, skin thickness, hair follicle diameter, hair cycle score and the percentage of hair cycle stage. Then hair shaft length and hair cycle were evaluated by human hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. The proliferative activities of human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) cultured in vitro with RSV were assessed using RTCA. The ability of RSV to protect hDPCs against H2O2-induced oxidative damage is examined by a ROS assay kit. RESULTS: Topical application of RSV significantly promoted hair growth and stimulated the transition of hair cycle from telogen into the anagen phase on shaved C57BL/6 mice. Ex vivo experiments showed that RSV increased the hair shaft length of HFs and delayed the entry into catagen. In vitro experiments indicated that RSV proliferated hDPCs and prevented hDPCs from oxidative damage caused by H2O2. CONCLUSION: RSV can promote hair growth and may be a potential candidate for the treatment of hair loss.",

Alopecia areata is a complex genetic disease that results in hair loss due to the autoimmune-mediated attack of the hair follicle. We previously defined a role for both rare and common variants in our earlier GWAS and linkage studies. Here, we identify rare variants contributing to Alopecia Areata using a whole exome sequencing and gene-level burden analyses approach on 849 Alopecia Areata patients compared to 15, 640 controls. KRT82 is identified as an Alopecia Areata risk gene with rare damaging variants in 51 heterozygous Alopecia Areata individuals (6. 01%), achieving genome-wide significance (p = 2. 18E-07). KRT82 encodes a hair-specific type II keratin that is exclusively expressed in the hair shaft cuticle during anagen phase, and its expression is decreased in Alopecia Areata patient skin and hair follicles. Finally, we find that cases with an identified damaging KRT82 variant and reduced KRT82 expression have elevated perifollicular CD8 infiltrates. In this work, we utilize whole exome sequencing to successfully identify a significant Alopecia Areata disease-relevant gene, KRT82, and reveal a proposed mechanism for rare variant predisposition leading to disrupted hair shaft integrity.",

Nanotechnology has been intensively applied to the development of novel cosmetic products for hair and scalp care during the last decades. Such a trend is corroborated by the fact that around 19% of the total nanocosmetics registered in the StatNano database are intended for hair and scalp care. Nanotechnology-enabled formulations based on nanoparticles, cyclodextrins, liposomes, and nanoemulsions have emerged as novel approaches due to chemical stability and their controlled release. Regarding hair care formulations, nanocarriers can target the hair shaft, hair follicle and scalp. Therefore, they have been used to treat several hair disorders, including dandruff and other hair damaging conditions. This review addressed the most important nanocarriers applied to hair-related disorders improvement. Furthermore, the application for hair photoprotection and improvement of hair color duration by nanotechnological formulations is also approached. Besides, we provided an overview of the current scenario of available nano-based commercial hair products and novel patented inventions. From the patent search, the Patent Cooperation Treaty was pointed as the most important depositing agency while the United States of America has been the most depositing country. On the other hand, according to the StatNano database, Brazil stands out in the hair care worldwide market, and it is also the main producer of hair cosmetics based on nanotechnology. Hence, as nano-based products offer several advantages over conventional cosmetics, it is expected that in the future there will be more research on nanocarriers applied to hair disorders, as well as commercial products and patent applications.",

Hair loss is a chronic disorder that affects many people ; however, a complete treatment has not yet been developed. Therefore, new therapeutic agents for preventing hair loss must be developed, and electromagnetic field (EMF) therapy has been proven to be a promising medical treatment in various fields, including hair loss treatment. This study evaluated the effect of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) intensity and exposure time by analyzing the expression of cytokines and anagen-related molecules, which influence hair activation and growth, in hair bulb spheroid (HBS) and hair follicle (HF) organ cultures. ELF-EMFs did not induce toxicity in the HBSs, as verified via the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Moreover, an ELF-EMF intensity of 5-20 G promoted the expression of ALP, versican, beta-catenin, and several cytokines (VEGF, PDGF, FGF-10, and ET-1) in HBSs. Immunohistochemical staining showed that ELF-EMF at an intensity of 5-20 G upregulated ALP and beta-catenin and decreased TUNEL staining in HBS. Moreover, HFs exposed to ELF-EMF for 60 min exhibited an increase in hair length and a 1. 5-fold increase in IL-4, ICAM-1, ALP, and versican mRNA expression compared to the control. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that 60 min of ELF-EMF can increase the expression of ALP and beta-catenin and decreases TUNEL staining in organ cultures. Collectively, our results demonstrated that ELF-EMF exposure at a 10 G intensity for 60 min promoted hair shaft growth in HFs due to the effect of cytokines and adhesion molecules via the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Therefore, ELF-EMF is a promising treatment for hair loss.",

There is a growing demand for hair loss treatments with minimal side effects and recurrence potential. Connarus semidecandrus Jack has been used as a folk medicine for fever in tropical regions, but its anti-alopecia effects remain unclear. In this study, the anti-androgenic alopecia effect of an ethanol extract of Connarus semidecandrus Jack (Cs-EE) was demonstrated in a testosterone-induced androgenic alopecia (AGA) model, in terms of the hair-skin ratio, hair type frequency, and hair thickness. The area of restored hair growth and thickened hair population after Cs-EE treatment showed the hair-growth-promoting effect of Cs-EE. Histological data support the possibility that Cs-EE could reduce hair loss and upregulate hair proliferation in mouse skin by shifting hair follicles from the catagen phase to the anagen phase. Western blotting indicated that Cs-EE reduced the expression of the androgenic receptor. Cs-EE treatment also inhibited programmed cell death by upregulating Bcl-2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels. The anti-alopecia effect of Cs-EE was confirmed by in vitro experiments showing that Cs-EE had suppressive effects on 5-alpha reductase activity and lymph node carcinoma of the prostate proliferation, and a proliferative effect on human hair-follicle dermal papilla (HDP) cells. Apoptotic pathways in HDP cells were downregulated by Cs-EE treatment. Thus, Cs-EE could be a potential treatment for AGA.",

Many complicationssuch as hepatic cirrhosis, neuropathy, cardiac infarction, and so on are associated with diabetes. Although a relationship between diabetes and hair loss has been recently reported, the treatment of diabetic hair loss by Wnt/beta-catenin activators has not been achieved yet. In this study, we found that the depilation-induced anagen phase was delayed in both db/db mice and high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. In diabetic mice, both hair regrowth and wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN) were reduced because of suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and decreased proliferation of hair follicle cells. We identified that KY19382, a small molecule that activates Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, restored the capabilities of regrowth and WIHN in diabetic mice. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activator also increased the length of the human hair follicle which was decreased under high glucose culture conditions. Overall, the diabetic condition reduced both hair regrowth and regeneration with suppression of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Consequently, the usage of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activators could be a potential strategy to treat diabetes-induced alopecia patients.",

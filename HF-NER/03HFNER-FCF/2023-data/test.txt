In   O

RESULTS   O
:   O
Sirt1   O

downregulated   O

response   O
to   O
the   O
TNFalpha   O
treatment   O
.   O
Additionally   O
,   O
TNFalpha   O
stress   O
reduced   O

,   O
and   O
these   O
effects   O
were   O
reversed   O
by   O
the   O
overexpression   O
of   O
Sirt1   O
.   O
At   O
the   O
molecular   O
level   O
,   O
Sirt1   O
overexpression   O
attenuated   O

Furthermore   O
,   O
Sirt1   O
modulated   O
mitochondrial   O

by   O
activating   O
the   O
MAPK-ERK-Mfn2   O

inhibition   O

the   O

Because   O

The   O

BACKGROUND   O
:   O
Costunolide   O
(COS)   O
,   O
a   O
naturally   O

sesquiterpene   O

is   O
known   O
to   O
exert   O
anti-inflammatory   O

,   O
and   O
anticancer   O
effects   O
.   O
This   O
study   O
was   O
undertaken   O
to   O
investigate   O
the   O

of   O

in   O
C57BL/6   O

RESULTS   O
:   O
Costunolide   O
significantly   O
promoted   O
the   O
proliferation   O
of   O
hHFDPCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
,   O
which   O
is   O
comparable   O
to   O
that   O
of   O

COS   O
also   O
inhibited   O
the   O
5alpha-reductase   O
activity   O
in   O
hHFDPCs   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
While   O
COS   O

the   O

of   O

increased   O
the   O

CONCLUSIONS   O
:   O
Our   O

illustrate   O
that   O
COS   O
promotes   O

in   O

Hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

by   O

.   O
Appropriate   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

relies   O
on   O
the   O

of   O

How   O
immune   O

niche   O
and   O

is   O
not   O
well   O
understood   O
.   O
We   O
took   O
advantage   O
of   O
wound-induced   O
hair   O
growth   O
(WIHG)   O
to   O
explore   O
the   O
relationship   O
between   O
wound   O
macrophages   O
and   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicle   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
regeneration   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
First   O
,   O
we   O
showed   O
that   O
WIHG   O
is   O
dependent   O
on   O
CD11b+F4/80+   O
macrophages   O
at   O
7-11   O
days   O
after   O
injury   O
.   O
Next   O
,   O
using   O
CX3CR1gfp/+:CCR2rfp/+   O
mice   O
to   O
capture   O
the   O
dynamic   O
spectrum   O
of   O
macrophage   O
phenotypes   O
during   O
wound   O
healing   O
,   O
we   O
showed   O
that   O
wound   O
macrophages   O
transition   O
from   O
a   O
CX3CR1lo/med   O
to   O
a   O
CX3CR1hi   O
phenotype   O
at   O
the   O
onset   O
of   O
WIHG   O
.   O
Finally   O
,   O
WIHG   O
is   O
abolished   O
in   O
mice   O
deficient   O
for   O
CX3CR1   O
,   O
delayed   O
with   O
pharmacological   O
inhibition   O
of   O
transforming   O

1   O
,   O
and   O
rescued   O
with   O
exogenous   O
transforming   O
growth   O
factor-beta1   O
.   O
Overall   O
,   O
we   O
propose   O
a   O
model   O
in   O
which   O
transforming   O
growth   O
factor-beta1   O
and   O
CX3CR1   O
are   O
critical   O
for   O
recruiting   O
and   O
maintaining   O

Terence   O

in   O
the   O
early   O
to   O
mid-1980   O
.   O
This   O
led   O
to   O
subsequent   O
methods   O
describing   O
the   O
isolation   O
and   O
culture   O
of   O

The   O
importance   O
of   O
these   O
models   O
in   O
the   O
study   O
of   O
the   O
biology   O
of   O
human   O
skin   O
glands   O
and   O
appendages   O
has   O
been   O
demonstrated   O
in   O
numerous   O
publications   O
and   O
their   O
importance   O
as   O
models   O
for   O
animal   O
replacement   O
,   O
refinement   O
and   O
reduction   O
(3Rs)   O
is   O
increasingly   O
important   O
.   O
In   O
particular   O
,   O
in   O
vitro   O
(ex   O
vivo)   O
hair   O
follicle   O
culture   O
has   O
played   O
a   O
significant   O
part   O
in   O
helping   O
elucidate   O
the   O
role   O
of   O
signalling   O
molecules   O
in   O
regulating   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
growth   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
and   O
hair   O
fibre   O
formation   O
and   O
has   O
been   O
especially   O
useful   O
in   O
understanding   O
metabolic   O
aspects   O
of   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
growth   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
.   O
However   O
,   O
obtaining   O
sufficient   O
numbers   O
of   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME
follicles   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
is   O
becoming   O
increasingly   O
difficult   O
as   O
plastic   O
surgery   O
becomes   O
less   O
invasive   O
and   O
smaller   O
skin   O
samples   O
provided   O
.   O
There   O
is   O
therefore   O
an   O
urgent   O
requirement   O
for   O
the   O

According   O
to   O
recent   O
evidence   O
(in   O
contrast   O
to   O
previous   O
bulge-centric   O
views)   O
,   O
the   O
SHG   O
is   O
the   O
primary   O
target   O
of   O
anagen-inducing   O
signalling   O
and   O

of   O

during   O
the   O

The   O
SHG   O
is   O
comprised   O
of   O
two   O
functionally   O
distinct   O
cell   O
populations   O
.   O

forms   O
all   O

,   O
while   O
the   O

SHG   O
(formed   O
by   O

builds   O
up   O

The   O
predetermination   O
of   O
SHG   O
cells   O
to   O
a   O
specific   O
morphogenetic   O
fate   O
contradicts   O
their   O
attribution   O
to   O
the   O
"stem   O
cell"   O
category   O
and   O
supports   O
SHG   O
designation   O
as   O
a   O
"germinative"   O
or   O
a   O
"founder"   O

.   O

this   O

state   O
during   O
the   O

remain   O
unknown   O
.   O
Functionally   O
,   O
the   O
SHG   O
serves   O
as   O
a   O
barrier   O
,   O
protecting   O
the   O
quiescent   O

stem   O
cell   O
niche   O
from   O
the   O
extensive   O

milieu   O
.   O
The   O
formation   O
of   O
the   O
SHG   O
is   O
a   O
prerequisite   O
for   O
efficient   O
"precommitment"   O
of   O
these   O

provides   O
for   O
easier   O
sensing   O

a   O

signals   O
.   O
In   O
general   O
,   O
the   O
formation   O
of   O
the   O
SHG   O
is   O
an   O
evolutionary   O
adaptation   O
,   O
which   O
allowed   O
the   O

Results   O
of   O
the   O

showed   O
that   O

were   O
higher   O
in   O

In   O
addition   O
,   O
DNA   O

increased   O
with   O
the   O

In   O
conclusion   O
,   O
RFR   O
emitted   O

Growing   O

Researchers   O
have   O
revealed   O
that   O
stress   O
could   O
indeed   O
inhibit   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

but   O
the   O
relationship   O
between   O

and   O

remains   O
unknown   O
.   O
In   O
this   O

We   O
found   O
that   O

,   O
decreased   O

The   O
alterations   O
of   O
5-HT   O

might   O
be   O
a   O

These   O

We   O
showed   O
that   O

Moreover   O
,   O
recombinant   O
activin   O

BACKGROUND   O
:   O
The   O
method   O
of   O
generating   O
bioengineered   O
skin   O
constructs   O
was   O
pioneered   O
several   O
decades   O
ago;   O
nowadays   O
these   O
constructs   O
are   O
used   O
regularly   O
for   O
the   O
treatment   O
of   O
severe   O
burns   O
and   O
nonhealing   O
wounds   O
.   O
Commonly   O
,   O
these   O
constructs   O
are   O
comprised   O
of   O
skin   O
fibroblasts   O
within   O
a   O
collagen   O
scaffold   O
,   O
forming   O
the   O
skin   O
dermis   O
,   O
and   O
stratified   O
keratinocytes   O
overlying   O
this   O
,   O
forming   O
the   O
skin   O
epidermis   O
.   O
In   O
the   O
past   O
decade   O
there   O
has   O
been   O
a   O
surge   O
of   O
interest   O
in   O
bioengineered   O
skins   O
,   O
with   O
researchers   O
seeking   O
alternative   O
cell   O
sources   O
,   O
or   O
scaffolds   O
,   O
from   O
which   O
constructs   O
can   O
be   O
established   O
,   O
and   O
for   O
more   O
biomimetic   O
equivalents   O
with   O

.   O
OBJECTIVES   O
:   O
To   O
evaluate   O
whether   O
human   O
hair   B-FOLLICLE-NAME

cells   I-FOLLICLE-NAME
can   O
act   O
as   O
an   O

source   O
for   O
engineering   O
the   O
dermal   O
component   O
of   O
engineered   O
skin   O
constructs   O
.   O
METHODS   O
:   O
We   O
established   O
in   O

skin   O
constructs   O
by   O
incorporating   O
into   O
the   O
collagenous   O
dermal   O
compartment   O

In   O

skins   O
were   O
established   O
by   O
mixing   O
dermal   O
cells   O
and   O
keratinocytes   O
in   O
chambers   O
on   O
top   O
of   O
immunologically   O
compromised   O
mice   O
.   O
RESULTS   O
:   O
All   O
fibroblast   O
subtypes   O
were   O
capable   O
of   O
supporting   O
growth   O
of   O
overlying   O

,   O
both   O
in   O

in   O

we   O

be   O
superior   O
to   O

in   O
their   O
capacity   O
to   O
influence   O
the   O
establishment   O
of   O

:   O
Human   O

can   O
be   O

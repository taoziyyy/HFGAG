Exploring the potential effect and mechanisms of protocatechuic acid on human hair follicle melanocytes.
This study aims to evaluate the effect of protocatechuic acid (PCA) on human hair follicle melanocytes (HFM).
Normal primary HFM were isolated and cultured till logarithmic period of second passage, then treated with different concentrations of PCA (0.1-200 mumol L-1) to study the cell proliferation, melanin contents, tyrosinase activity and protein and mRNA expression of melanogenic genes (tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP-1), tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2), and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)) in the cultured HFM.
In addition, we have also measured the contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in PCA treated HFM.
Vitamin C was used as a positive control.
The result showed that PCA can decrease the synthesis of melanin and the tyrosinase activity with IC50 = 8.9 mumol L-1 and IC50 = 6.4 mumol L-1, respectively, at the treatment time of 24 hours, without inducing any cytotoxicity in HFM cells.
In addition, the mRNA transcription and protein expression levels of TRP-1, TRP-2 and MITF significantly decreased with a dose-dependent manner after 24-hour PCA treated in HFM cells.
Furthermore, PCA has significantly increased the SOD and GSH activity in a dose-dependent manner for 24-hour PCA treatment.
This study suggested that PCA has an inhibitory effect on the production of melanin through down-regulation of the expression of melanogenesis-related protein and the effect of anti-oxidation, which could be useful for the therapy of melanin overproduction or skin whitening.

Internalization of the TAT-PBX1 fusion protein significantly enhances the proliferation of human hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells and delays their senescence.
OBJECTIVES: To express a TAT-PBX1 fusion protein using a prokaryotic expression system and to explore potential effects of TAT-PBX1 in the proliferation and senescence of human hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
RESULTS: The TAT-PBX1 fusion was produced in inclusion bodies and heterogenously expressed in Rosetta (DE3) cells.
Immunofluorescence staining showed that TAT-PBX1 fusion proteins were internalized by human hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
The growth rate of cells was increased after treatment with more than 5.0 mug/mL of TAT-PBX1.
The rate of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase positive cells was reduced in the 10.0 mug/mL TAT-PBX1 group (28%) than the 0 mug/mL control group (60%).
Cells treated with the TAT-PBX1 fusion protein showed higher expression of p-AKT (1.22-fold that of the control), which indicates that TAT-PBX1 activated AKT pathway after cellular uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: The TAT-PBX1 fusion protein increased the proliferation of hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells and delayed their senescence by activating the AKT pathway following internalization by cells.

Participation of Somatic Stem Cells, Labeled by a Unique Antibody (A3) Recognizing both N-glycan and Peptide, to Hair Follicle Cycle and Cutaneous Wound Healing in Rats.
A monoclonal antibody (A3) was generated by using rat malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) cells as the antigen.
Generally, MFH is considered to be a sarcoma derived from undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.
Molecular biological analyses using the lysate of rat MFH cells revealed that A3 is a conformation specific antibody recognizing both N-glycan and peptide.
A3-labeled cells in bone marrow were regarded as somatic stem cells, because the cells partly coexpressed CD90 and CD105 (both immature mesenchymal markers).
In the hair follicle cycle, particularly the anagen, the immature epithelial cells (suprabasal cells) near the bulge and some immature mesenchymal cells in the disassembling dermal papilla and regenerating connective tissue sheath/hair papilla reacted to A3.
In the cutaneous wound-healing process, A3-labeled epithelial cells participated in re-epithelialization in the wound bed, and apparently, the labeled cells were derived from the hair bulge; in addition, A3-labeled immature mesenchymal cells in the connective tissue sheath of hair follicles at the wound edge showed the expansion of the A3 immunolabeling.
A3-labeled immature epithelial and mesenchymal cells contributed to morphogenesis in the hair cycle and tissue repair after a cutaneous wound.
A3 could become a unique antibody to identify somatic stem cells capable of differentiating both epithelial and mesenchymal cells in rat tissues.

Exploration of potential lipid biomarkers for premature canities by UPLC-QTOF-MS analyses of hair follicle roots.
BACKGROUND: The rate of premature greying, referred to as canities, varies among populations, and effective treatments are lacking.
However, few studies at the molecular level have been reported.
OBJECTIVES: Comparing lipid profiles of individuals with premature canities and healthy volunteers to explore the mechanism of premature canities.
METHODS: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) was used to detect lipids in the hair follicle root.
Multivariate data analysis was used to show lipid changes in follicle roots.
RESULTS: We identified lipids in the hair follicle root that differ between black and white hair and analysed key lipids contributing to white hair development.
We divided the samples into three groups: PC-WH (Premature canities-White hair), PC-PH (Premature canities-Pigmented hair), Control-PH (Pigmented hair).
Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), vitamin D3 (VD3) and cholesterol in Control-PH were higher than those in PC-WH.
Sphingomyelin (SP), phosphatidic acid (PA), VD3 and diglyceride (DG) were lower in PC-WH than in PC-PH.
Levels of VD3 were highest in Control-PH, gradually decreased as the severity of PC-PH increased and were lowest in PC-WH.
CONCLUSION: There are 7 main class candidate compounds involved in the generation of white hair.
VD3 showed a substantial decrease in white hair and was a potential target for further studies of premature canities.

EZH2-mediated inhibition of microRNA-22 promotes differentiation of hair follicle stem cells by elevating STK40 expression.
Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) contribute to the regeneration of hair follicles (HFs), thus accelerating hair growth.
microRNAs (miRs) are potential regulators in various cellular processes, including HFSC proliferation and differentiation.
This study proposed a potential target, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) for facilitating hair growth, due to its function over HFSC activities by mediating the miR-22/serine/threonine kinase 40 (STK40)/myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2)/alkaline phosphatase (ALP) axis.
Gain- and loss-of-function approaches were adopted to explore the roles of EZH2, miR-22, and STK40 in the proliferation and apoptosis of HFSCs, along with the functional relevance of MEF2-ALP activity.
STK40 was elevated during HFSC differentiation, which was found to facilitate HFSC proliferation, but impede their apoptosis by activating MEF2-ALP.
Mechanically, miR-22 targeted and inversely regulated STK40, which inhibited MEF2-ALP activity to impede HFSC proliferation and differentiation.
Moreover, EZH2 elevated the STK40 expression by repressing miR-22 to promote the proliferation and differentiation of HFSCs.
Furthermore, in vivo experiments further validated the roles of EZH2 and STK40 on hair follicle neogenesis and hair growth.
Collectively, EZH2 elevated the STK40 expression by downregulating miR-22, consequently accelerating differentiation of HFSCs and hair growth, which sheds light on the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for hair growth.

Lower proximal cup and outer root sheath cells regenerate hair bulbs during anagen hair follicle repair after chemotherapeutic injury.
The cell dynamics and cell origin for anagen hair follicle (HF) repair following chemotherapeutic injury are unclear.
We first mapped the HF response to cyclophosphamide (CYP) at natural anagen VI in mice.
We found that 30-60 mg/kg of CYP leads to dose-dependent HF dystrophy that was spontaneously repaired with anagen resumption, while 120 mg/kg of CYP prematurely induced catagen/telogen entry.
To explore how anagen HF repair is achieved in the dystrophic anagen pathway, we analysed the cell dynamics at 30 mg/kg of CYP.
Hair bulbs first shrunk due to matrix cell apoptosis associated with DNA double-strand breaks.
DNA damage was repaired, and ordered hair bulb structures were restored within 96 hours.
Bulge stem cells did not undergo apoptosis nor proliferation.
K5+ basal lower proximal cup cells and outer root sheath cells quickly replenished the cells in the germinative zone and regenerated the concentric layered structures of the lower HF segment.
Therefore, anagen HFs are able to summon extra-bulge progenitor cells in close proximity to the damaged matrix for quick repair after CYP injury.

Melanocyte Precursors in the Hair Follicle Bulge of Repigmented Vitiligo Skin Are Controlled by RHO-GTPase, KCTD10, and CTNNB1 Signaling.
In repigmentation of human vitiligo, the melanocyte (MC) precursors in the hair follicle bulge proliferate, migrate, and differentiate to repopulate the depigmented epidermis.
Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of pathways and signals in the bulge that control the repigmentation process.
Using biopsies from patients with vitiligo, we have selectively harvested, by laser capture microdissection, MC and keratinocyte precursors from the hair follicle bulge of untreated vitiligo skin and vitiligo skin treated with narrow-band UVB.
The captured material was subjected to whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing.
With this strategy, we found that repigmentation in the bulge MC precursors is driven by KCTD10, a signal with unknown roles in the skin, and CTNNB1 (encoding beta-catenin) and RHO guanosine triphosphatase [RHO GTPase, RHO], two signaling pathways previously shown to be involved in pigmentation biology.
Knockdown studies in cultured human MCs of RHOJ, the upmost differentially expressed RHO family component, corroborated with our findings in patients with vitiligo, identified RHOJ involvement in UV response and melanization, and confirmed previously identified roles in melanocytic cell migration and apoptosis.
A better understanding of mechanisms that govern repigmentation in MC precursors will enable the discovery of molecules that induce robust repigmentation phenotypes in vitiligo.

Effects of platelet-rich plasma on in vitro hair follicle germ preparation for hair regenerative medicine.
Hair regenerative medicine is a promising approach for the treatment of hair loss and involves the transplantation of follicular stem cells into bald spots to regenerate hair.
Various approaches have been investigated to engineer tissue grafts for use in hair regenerative medicine.
Tissue-like three-dimensional aggregates, such as bioengineered hair follicle germs (HFGs), have shown great promise for hair regeneration, with normal tissue morphology and hair cycles.
However, these approaches have not yet been applied in clinical settings, and further studies are needed to improve hair generation efficiency.
The biological molecules in in vivo microenvironments around HFGs may provide cues for the in vitro preparation of HFGs with higher trichogenic functionalities.
Activated platelet-rich plasma releasate (PRPr) is an autologous source of signaling molecules including growth factors and cytokines.
In this study, we investigated the effects of PRPr on the preparation of HFGs in vitro.
The presence of PRPr did not hinder the spontaneous formation of dumbbell-like HFGs from a suspension of embryonic skin-derived epithelial and mesenchymal cells in a custom-designed HFG culture plate.
HFGs prepared with PRPr displayed greater levels of follicular gene expression compared to those prepared in the absence of PRPr.
Moreover, the hair regeneration ability upon intracutaneous transplantation was significantly improved in the presence of PRPr.
These results suggest that PRPr is beneficial for engineering HFGs for autologous hair regenerative medicine.

Glutamine Metabolism Controls Stem Cell Fate Reversibility and Long-Term Maintenance in the Hair Follicle.
Stem cells reside in specialized niches that are critical for their function.
Upon activation, hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) exit their niche to generate the outer root sheath (ORS), but a subset of ORS progeny returns to the niche to resume an SC state.
Mechanisms of this fate reversibility are unclear.
We show that the ability of ORS cells to return to the SC state requires suppression of a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation and glutamine metabolism that occurs during early HFSC lineage progression.
HFSC fate reversibility and glutamine metabolism are regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)-Akt signaling axis within the niche.
Deletion of mTORC2 results in a failure to re-establish the HFSC niche, defective hair follicle regeneration, and compromised long-term maintenance of HFSCs.
These findings highlight the importance of spatiotemporal control of SC metabolic states in organ homeostasis.

Optogenetically Controlled TrkA Activity Improves the Regenerative Capacity of Hair-Follicle-Derived Stem Cells to Differentiate into Neurons and Glia.
Hair-follicle-derived stem cells (HSCs) originating from the bulge region of the mouse vibrissa hair follicle are able to differentiate into neuronal and glial lineage cells.
The tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptor that is expressed on these cells plays key roles in mediating the survival and differentiation of neural progenitors as well as in the regulation of the growth and regeneration of different neural systems.
In this study, the OptoTrkA system is introduced, which is able to stimulate TrkA activity via blue-light illumination in HSCs.
This allows to determine whether TrkA signaling is capable of influencing the proliferation, migration, and neural differentiation of these somatic stem cells.
It is found that OptoTrkA is able to activate downstream molecules such as ERK and AKT with blue-light illumination, and subsequently able to terminate this kinase activity in the dark.
HSCs with OptoTrkA activity show an increased ability for proliferation and migration and also exhibited accelerated neuronal and glial cell differentiation.
These findings suggest that the precise control of TrkA activity using optogenetic tools is a viable strategy for the regeneration of neurons from HSCs, and also provides a novel insight into the clinical application of optogenetic tools in cell-transplantation therapy.

Selective Elimination of NG2-Expressing Hair Follicle Stem Cells Exacerbates the Sensitization Phase of Contact Dermatitis in a Transgenic Rat Model.
"The hair cycle consists of three different phases: anagen (growth), catagen (regression), and telogen (resting).
During the anagen phase, hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in the bulge and the secondary hair germ proliferate and generate the outer and inner root sheath cells and the hair shafts.
We previously identified NG2-immunoreactive (NG2+) cells as HFSCs in both regions of the hair follicles.
Recently, the interaction between the hair cycle and the cutaneous immune system has been re-examined under physiological and pathological conditions.', However, the roles of NG2+ HFSCs in the skin's immune system remain completely elucidated., 'In the present study, we investigated whether the elimination of NG2+ HFSCs affects the induction of allergic contact dermatitis, using a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk)/ganciclovir (GCV) suicide gene system.
When the GCV solution was applied to the skin of NG2-HSVtk transgenic (Tg) rats during the depilation-induced anagen phase, NG2+ HFSCs in the Tg rat skin induced apoptotic cell death.
Under exposure of a hapten, the selective ablation of NG2+ HFSCs during the anagen phase aggravated the sensitization phase of allergic contact dermatitis.
These findings suggest that NG2+ HFSCs and their progeny have immunosuppressive abilities during the anagen phase."

Hair follicle targeting with curcumin nanocrystals: Influence of the formulation properties on the penetration efficacy.
Nanocrystals are a universal formulation approach for improved drug delivery of poorly water-soluble drug substances.
Besides oral application, also topical application of the nanocrystals is feasible, because the increased kinetic solubility of the nanocrystals results in an increased concentration gradient, thus fostering passive, dermal penetration.
Nanocrystals are also promising for targeting drug substances into the hair follicle.
After penetration into the hair follicle, the nanocrystals could form a depot from which the active is released into the hair follicle.
Thus, leading to a long-lasting and very efficient dermal drug delivery.
The efficacy of nanocrystals to penetrate the hair follicles and the influence of the vehicle in which the nanocrystals are suspended was not yet investigated.
Therefore, in this study curcumin nanocrystals with a size of about 300 nm were produced and incorporated into gels with different properties.
The efficacy to penetrate the hair follicles, as well as the passive, dermal penetration, was assessed on the ex-vivo pig ear model.
Nanocrystals were efficiently taken up by the hair follicles and reached the lower part of the infundibulum.
This region is optimal for efficient drug delivery because the barrier of the lower infundibulum is not fully developed and thus more permeable, which results in a less hindered passive diffusion of drug substances.
The penetration efficacy of the nanocrystals into the hair follicles was not affected by the different types of vehicles, which represented either oleogels or hydrogels that varied in viscosity as well as in the type and the concentration of the gelling agent.
All gels possessed a shear-thinning flow behavior and it is hypothesized that all gels fluidized during the skin massage, whereby leading to similarly low viscosities than the aqueous nanosuspension and thus to similar penetration results.
The passive, dermal penetration of curcumin was different for the different gels and the main driving parameter leading to good passive diffusion was caused by good skin hydrating properties of the vehicle.
The best passive penetration was achieved from hydrogels that contained a humectant.
However, the addition of the humectant reduced the efficacy of the nanocrystals to penetrate the hair follicle.
Data so far, therefore, suggest that hair follicle targeting with nanocrystals that are suspended in water or simple, shear-thinning gels is highly effective.
However, the addition of other excipients, e.g.
humectants, to these vehicles might cause changes in the penetration profiles.
More research in this regard is needed to understand these observations in more detail.

Preparing the hair follicle canal for hair shaft emergence.
The emergence of hair is a defining event during mammalian skin development, but the cellular mechanisms leading to the opening of the hair follicle canal remain poorly characterized.
Our previous studies have shown that early hair buds possess a central column of differentiated keratinocytes expressing Keratin 79 (K79), which marks the future hair follicle opening.
Here, we report that during late embryogenesis and early postnatal development, K79+ cells at the distal tips of these columns downregulate E-cadherin, change shape, recede and undergo cell death.
These changes likely occur independently of sebaceous glands and the growing hair shaft, and serve to create an orifice for hair to subsequently emerge.
Defects in this process may underlie phenomena such as ingrown hair or may potentially contribute to upper hair follicle pathologies including acne, hidradenitis suppurativa and infundibular cysts.

Hair follicle bulge-derived stem cells promote tissue regeneration during skin expansion.
Skin expansion is widely used in reconstructive surgery to obtain supplemental and optimal skin.
Enhancing the regenerative capacity of expanded skin is therefore of great interest.
Hair follicle bulge-derived stem cells (HFBSCs) located in hair follicle bulges are closely associated with skin; HFBSC transplantation could promote cutaneous wound repair.
However, the effects of transplanted HFBSCs on skin regeneration during expansion remain unclear.
The aim of the study was to reveal the potential effects of transplanted HFBSCs in the expanded skin and explore its mechanism.
Our results showed higher skin area, tissue weight, epidermal thickness, dermal thickness, proliferating cell count, collagen content, microcirculatory blood flow, blood vessels, and lower retraction ratios were observed in HFBSC-injected rats compared to uninjected controls.
Moreover, the transplanted HFBSCs directly contributed to tissue regeneration by differentiating into vascular endothelial cells, epidermal cells, and the outer root sheath cells of hair follicle.
Higher expression of EGF, VEGF, bFGF, and TGF-beta were observed in HFBSC-injected rats.
Our research demonstrated the transplanted HFBSCs could promote skin regeneration by differentiating into various types of skin related cells and by up-regulating the expression of growth factors.
Our results could form a basis for the development of novel strategies to enhance regeneration in expanded skin by using HFBSCs.

Stress-sensing in the human greying hair follicle: Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) depletion in hair bulb melanocytes in canities-prone scalp.
Canities (or hair greying) is an age-linked loss of the natural pigment called melanin from hair.
While the specific cause(s) underlying the loss of melanogenically-active melanocytes from the anagen hair bulbs of affected human scalp remains unclear, oxidative stress sensing appears to be a key factor involved.
In this study, we examined the follicular melanin unit in variably pigmented follicles from the aging human scalp of healthy individuals (22-70 years).
Over 20 markers were selected within the following categories: melanocyte-specific, apoptosis, cell cycle, DNA repair/damage, senescence and oxidative stress.
As expected, a reduction in melanocyte-specific markers in proportion to the extent of canities was observed.
A major finding of our study was the intense and highly specific nuclear expression of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) protein within melanocytes in anagen hair follicle bulbs.
ATM is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is recruited and activated by DNA double-strand breaks and functions as an important sensor of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human cells.
The incidence and expression level of ATM correlated with pigmentary status in canities-affected hair follicles.
Moreover, increased staining of the redox-associated markers 8-OHdG, GADD45 and GP-1 were also detected within isolated bulbar melanocytes, although this change was not clearly associated with donor age or canities extent.
Surprisingly, we were unable to detect any specific change in the expression of other markers of oxidative stress, senescence or DNA damage/repair in the canities-affected melanocytes compared to surrounding bulbar keratinocytes.
By contrast, several markers showed distinct expression of markers for oxidative stress and apoptosis/differentiation in the inner root sheath (IRS) as well as other parts of the hair follicle.
Using our in vitro model of primary human scalp hair follicle melanocytes, we showed that ATM expression increased after incubation with the pro-oxidant hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
In addition, this ATM increase was prevented by pre-incubation of cells with antioxidants.
The relationship between ATM and redox stress sensing was further evidenced as we observed that the inhibition of ATM expression by chemical inhibition promoted the loss of melanocyte viability induced by oxidative stress.
Taken together these new findings illustrate the key role of ATM in the protection of human hair follicle melanocytes from oxidative stress/damage within the human scalp hair bulb.
In conclusion, these results highlight the remarkable complexity and role of redox sensing in the status of human hair follicle growth, differentiation and pigmentation.

Stem cell-intrinsic mechanisms regulating adult hair follicle homeostasis.
Adult hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) undergo dynamic and periodic molecular changes in their cellular states throughout the hair homeostatic cycle.
These states are tightly regulated by cell-intrinsic mechanisms and by extrinsic signals from the microenvironment.
HFSCs are essential not only for fuelling hair growth, but also for skin wound healing.
Increasing evidence suggests an important role of HFSCs in organizing multiple skin components around the hair follicle, thus functioning as an organizing centre during adult skin homeostasis.
Here, we focus on recent findings on cell-intrinsic mechanisms of HFSC homeostasis, which include transcription factors, histone modifications, DNA regulatory elements, non-coding RNAs, cell metabolism, cell polarity and post-transcriptional mRNA processing.
Several transcription factors are now known to participate in well-known signalling pathways that control hair follicle homeostasis, as well as in super-enhancer activities to modulate HFSC and progenitor lineage progression.
Interestingly, HFSCs have been shown to secrete molecules that are important in guiding the organization of several skin components around the hair follicle, including nerves, arrector pili muscle and vasculature.
Finally, we discuss recent technological advances in the field such as single-cell RNA sequencing and live imaging, which revealed HFSC and progenitor heterogeneity and brought new light to understanding crosstalking between HFSCs and the microenvironment.
The field is well on its way to generate a comprehensive map of molecular interactions that should serve as a solid theoretical platform for application in hair and skin disease and ageing.

High-resolution single-cell transcriptomics reveals heterogeneity of self-renewing hair follicle stem cells.
Multipotent bulge stem cells (SCs) fuel the hair follicle (HF) cyclic growth during adult skin homeostasis, but their intrinsic molecular heterogeneity is not well understood.
These hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) engage in bouts of self-renewal, migration and differentiation during the hair cycle.
Here, we perform high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of HFSCs sorted as CD34+ /K14-H2BGFP+ from mouse skin at mid-anagen, the self-renewal stage.
We dissect the transcriptomic profiles and unravel population-specific transcriptional heterogeneity.
Unsupervised clustering reveals five major HFSC populations, which distinguished by known markers associated with both the bulge and the outer root sheath (ORS) underneath.
These populations include quiescent bulge, ORS cellular states and proliferative cells.
Lineage trajectory analysis predicted the prospective differentiation path of these cellular states and their corresponding self-renewing subpopulations.
The bulge population itself can be further sub-divided into distinct subpopulations that can be mapped to the upper, mid and lower bulge regions, and present a decreasing quiescence score.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed new markers and suggested potentially distinct functions of the ORS and bulge subpopulations.
This included communications between the upper bulge subpopulation and sensory nerves and between the upper ORS and skin vasculature, as well as enrichment of a bulge subset in cell migratory functions.
The lower ORS enriched genes may potentially enable nutrients passing from the surrounding fat and vasculature cells towards the proliferating hair matrix cells.
Thus, we provide a comprehensive account of HFSC molecular heterogeneity during their self-renewing stage, which enables future HF functional studies.

Age-Related Changes in Female Scalp Dermal Sheath and Dermal Fibroblasts: How the Hair Follicle Environment Impacts Hair Aging.
In women, aging leads to reduced hair density and thinner fibers and can result in female-pattern hair loss.
However, the impact of the aging dermal environment on female scalp hair follicles remains unclear.
In this study, we document in situ changes in 22 women (aged 19-81 years) and primary cultures of dermal fibroblast and dermal sheath cells.
In situ, the papillary reticular boundary was indistinguishable in the young scalp but prominent in the scalp of those aged >40 years, accompanied by reduced podoplanin (PDPN) expression, increased versican expression, and changes in collagen organization.
Hair follicles were shorter, not reaching the adipose layer.
Hyaluronic acid synthase 2 was highly expressed, whereas matrix metalloproteinase 1 was elevated in the dermal papilla and dermal sheath in situ.
Primary dermal fibroblast cultures confirmed that matrix metalloproteinase 1 mRNA, MMP1, increased with aging, whereas in dermal sheath cells, hyaluronic acid synthase 2, HAS2, and PDPN increased and alpha-smooth muscle actin alphaSMA mRNA decreased.
Both exhibited increased cartilage oligomeric protein, COMP mRNA expression.
Proteomics revealed an increase in dermal sheath proteins in the dermal fibroblast secretome with aging.
In summary, aging female scalp shows striking structural and biological changes in the hair follicle environment that may impact hair growth.

miR-31-5p promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of goat hair follicle stem cells by targeting RASA1/MAP3K1 pathway.
"The Yangtze River Delta white goat is a sole goat species that can naturally produce superior-quality brush hair.', It's worth to mention that study the developmental mechanism of goat hair follicle stem cells is vital for future breed preservation and molecular breeding., 'In this study, we successfully isolated hair follicle stem cells from the skin tissue of fetal sheep neck spine, and harvested superior-quality and normal-quality brush hair goat tissue.
The expression of miR-31-5p in goat hair follicle stem cells was verified by qPCR and Western blot.
The effects of overexpression or inhibition of miR-31-5p on the proliferation and apoptosis of hair follicle stem cells were detected by EdU, CCK-8, flow cytometry, etc.
miR-31-5p can significantly improve cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis by targeting RASA1 and upregulating MAP3K1 level, whereas miR-31-5p knockdown led to an opposite effect.
These results reveal a miR-31-5p-associated regulatory network between miR-31-5p and RASA1/MAP3K1 during the progression of superiorquality brush hair traits."

Using WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis) to identify the hub genes of skin hair follicle development in fetus stage of Inner Mongolia cashmere goat.
OBJECTIVE: Mature hair follicles represent an important stage of hair follicle development, which determines the stability of hair follicle structure and its ability to enter the hair cycle.
Here, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify hub genes of mature skin and hair follicles in Inner Mongolian cashmere goats.
METHODS: We used transcriptome sequencing data for the skin of Inner Mongolian cashmere goats from fetal days 45-135 days, and divided the co expressed genes into different modules by WGCNA.
Characteristic values were used to screen out modules that were highly expressed in mature skin follicles.
Module hub genes were then selected based on the correlation coefficients between the gene and module eigenvalue, gene connectivity, and Gene Ontology (GO)/Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis.
The results were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
RESULTS: Ten modules were successfully defined, of which one, with a total of 3166 genes, was selected as a specific module through sample and gene expression pattern analyses.
A total of 584 candidate hub genes in the module were screened by the correlation coefficients between the genes and module eigenvalue and gene connectivity.
Finally, GO/KEGG functional enrichment analyses detected WNT10A as a key gene in the development and maturation of skin hair follicles in fetal Inner Mongolian cashmere goats.
qPCR showed that the expression trends of 13 genes from seven fetal skin samples were consistent with the sequencing results, indicating that the sequencing results were reliable.n.

Hair follicle dystrophy in a litter of domestic cats resembling lanceolate hair mutant mice.
BACKGROUND: A new congenital hair-shaft abnormality resembling the lanceolate hair phenotype of rodents is described in a litter of four domestic short hair (DSH) cats.
Data relating to hair shaft and follicle disorders remain scarce in veterinary medicine.
OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare structural abnormalities in these cats with other hair dystrophies in cats and other mammals.
ANIMALS: A DSH cat litter with progressive noninflammatory alopecia.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Histopathological evaluation, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray based element analysis defined the hair and skin changes in cats born with alopecia.
Findings were compared to archival data from normal cats and lanceolate hair (Dsg4lahJ ) and Keratin 75 (Krt75tm1Der ) mutant mice.
RESULTS: Light and scanning electron microscopy of the hairs revealed lance- or spear-head shaped defects of the hair tip.
Histological findings were swollen hair shafts, initially above the hair bulb matrix and later found in the distal parts of the telogen hair follicles, similar to those observed in Dsg4lahJ Krt75tm1Der mutant mice.
Transmission electron microscopy of the hair shaft and hair follicles showed a loss in the normal structure of the guard hairs in the alopecic cats.
There was a statistically significant decrease in sulfur content just below the defects in the hair shafts (trichothiodystrophy).
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A rare form of congenital alopecia resulting in follicular dystrophy is described in cats which is similar to hair follicle and hair-shaft changes reported in several mutant mouse strains with single gene mutations in adhesion molecules or keratin genes.

Anti-androgenetic alopecia effect of policosanol from Chinese wax by regulating abnormal hormone levels to suppress premature hair follicle entry into the regression phase.
Previously, we have demonstrated that policosanol from Chinese wax suppressed testosterone(T)-induced alopecia in mice.
However, the underlying mechanism remained to be determined.
Herein, we investigated the mechanism of policosanol against androgenetic alopecia (AGA).
AGA was induced in Kunming mice by subcutaneous administration of testosterone propionate for 60 d. Policosanol (0.5 %, 1% or 2%) was applied topically on the back of mice.
Finasteride (2%) was applied topically as a positive control.
The serum T and estradiol (E2) concentrations were determined by ELISA after 28 and 60 days of treatment.
The cutaneous expression or activity of key mediators of hair growth, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF), was measured.
MTS assay was performed to evaluate cell proliferation in cultured human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
Western blotting was performed to evaluate the protein expression of Bax, Bcl2, TGF-beta2, caspase-9, and caspase-3.
We found lower T and T/E2 ratio in mice treated with policosanol than in the model group.
Policosanol suppressed premature hair follicle entry into the regression phase, as shown by improving VEGF and EGF expression and ALP activity.
The MTS assay showed that policosanol markedly inhibited the apoptosis of DHT-treated DPCs.
Western blotting showed that policosanol significantly reduced the protein expression of TGF-beta2, cleaved caspese-9, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax, and increased that of Bcl2.
The optimal effect was obtained with 12.50 g/mL policosanol.
In conclusion, policosanol prevents androgenetic alopecia by regulating hormone levels and suppressing premature hair follicle entry into the regression phase.

Compartmentalised metabolic programmes in human anagen hair follicles: New targets to modulate epithelial stem cell behaviour, keratinocyte proliferation and hair follicle immune status?
Human scalp hair follicles (HF) preferentially engage in glycolysis followed by lactate production in the presence of oxygen (i.e.
the Warburg effect).
Through the spatiotemporally controlled expression of key metabolic proteins, we hypothesise that the Warburg effect and other HF metabolic programmes are compartmentalised by region in order to regulate regional cell fate and phenotypes, such as epithelial stem cell quiescence in the bulge or keratinocyte proliferation in the hair matrix.
We further propose that metabolic conditions in the HF are organised in accordance with the lactate shuttle, hypothesised to occur in other tissue systems and tumours, but never before described in the HF.
Specifically, we argue that lactate is produced and exported by glycolytic GLUT1+ lower outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes.
We further propose that lactate is then utilised by neighbouring highly proliferative matrix keratinocytes to fuel oxidative metabolism via MCT1-mediated uptake.
Furthermore, as lactate has been described to be immunomodulatory, its production and accumulation could enhance immune tolerance in the HF bulb.
Here we delineate how to experimentally probe this hypothesis, define major open questions and present preliminary immunohistological evidence in support of metabolic compartmentalisation and lactate shuttling.
Overall, we argue that basic and translational hair research needs to rediscover the importance of lactate in human HF biology, well beyond its recognised role in murine HF epithelial stem cells, and should explore how HF metabolism can be therapeutically targeted to modulate hair growth and the immunological HF microenvironment as a novel strategy for managing hair loss disorders.

A Wnt5a-Cdc42 axis controls aging and rejuvenation of hair-follicle stem cells.
Normal hair growth occurs in cycles, comprising growth (anagen), cessation (catagen) and rest (telogen).
Upon aging, the initiation of anagen is significantly delayed, which results in impaired hair regeneration.
Hair regeneration is driven by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs).
We show here that aged HFSCs present with a decrease in canonical Wnt signaling and a shift towards non-canonical Wnt5a driven signaling which antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling.
Elevated expression of Wnt5a in HFSCs upon aging results in elevated activity of the small RhoGTPase Cdc42 as well as a change in the spatial distribution of Cdc42 within HFSCs.
Treatment of aged HFSC with a specific pharmacological inhibitor of Cdc42 activity termed CASIN to suppress the aging-associated elevated activity of Cdc42 restored canonical Wnt signaling in aged HFSCs.
Treatment of aged mice in vivo with CASIN induced anagen onset and increased the percentage of anagen skin areas.
Aging-associated functional deficits of HFSCs are at least in part intrinsic to HFSCs and can be restored by rational pharmacological approaches.

Hair-Follicle-Associated Pluripotent (HAP) Stem Cells Can Extensively Differentiate to Tyrosine-Hydroxylase-Expressing Dopamine-Secreting Neurons.
"Hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells are located in the bulge area of hair follicles from mice and humans and have been shown to differentiate to neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, melanocytes and beating cardiac muscle cells in vitro.
Subsequently, we demonstrated that HAP stem cells could effect nerve and spinal-cord regeneration in mouse models, differentiating to Schwann cells and neurons in this process.
HAP stem cells can be banked by cryopreservation and preserve their ability to differentiate.
In the present study, we demonstrated that mouse HAP stem cells cultured in neural-induction medium can extensively differentiate to dopaminergic neurons, which express tyrosine hydroxylase and secrete dopamine.', These results indicate that the dopaminergic neurons differentiated from HAP stem cells may be useful in the future to improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in the clinic.]"

Photobiomodulation therapy for hair regeneration: A synergetic activation of beta-CATENIN in hair follicle stem cells by ROS and paracrine WNTs.
Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) has shown encouraging results in the treatment of hair loss.
However, the mechanism by which PBMT controls cell behavior to coordinate hair cycle is unclear.
Here, PBMT is found to drive quiescent hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) activation and alleviate hair follicle atrophy.
Mechanistically, PBMT triggers a new hair cycle by upregulating beta-CATENIN expression in HFSCs.
Loss of beta-Catenin (Ctnnb1) in HFSCs blocked PBMT-induced hair regeneration.
Additionally, we show PBMT-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta signaling pathway to inhibit proteasome degradation of beta-CATENIN in HFSCs.
Furthermore, PBMT promotes the expression and secretion of WNTs in skin-derived precursors (SKPs) to further activate the beta-CATENIN signal in HFSCs.
By contrast, eliminating ROS or inhibiting WNT secretion attenuates the activation of HFSCs triggered by PBMT.
Collectively, our work suggests that PBMT promotes hair regeneration through synergetic activation of beta-CATENIN in HFSCs by ROS and paracrine WNTs by SKPs.

Defining a Role for G-Protein Coupled Receptor/cAMP/CRE-Binding Protein Signaling in Hair Follicle Stem Cell Activation.
Manipulation of adrenergic signaling has been shown experimentally and clinically to affect hair follicle growth.
In this study, we provide direct evidence that canonical cAMP/CRE-binding protein signaling through adrenergic receptors can regulate hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) activation and hair cycle.
We found that CRE-binding protein activation is regulated through the hair cycle and coincides with HFSC activation.
Both isoproterenol and procaterol, agonists of adrenergic receptors, show the capacity to activate the hair cycle in mice.
Furthermore, deletion of ADRB2 receptor, which is thought to mediate sympathetic nervous system regulation of HFSCs, was sufficient to block HFSC activation.
Downstream, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin or inhibition of phosphodiesterase to increase cAMP accumulation or direct application of cAMP was each sufficient to promote HFSC activation and accelerate initiation of hair cycle.
Genetic induction of a Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug allele showed that G-protein coupled receptor/GalphaS stimulation, specifically in HFSCs, promoted the activation of the hair cycle.
Finally, we provide evidence that G-protein coupled receptor/CRE-binding protein signaling can potentially act on HFSCs by promoting glycolytic metabolism, which was previously shown to stimulate HFSC activation.
Together, these data provide mechanistic insights into the role of sympathetic innervation on HFSC function.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor controls skin homeostasis, regeneration, and hair follicle cycling by adjusting epidermal stem cell function.
Skin integrity requires constant maintenance of a quiescent, yet responsive, population of stem cells.
While interfollicular epidermal progenitors control normal homeostasis, hair follicle stem cells residing within the bulge provide regenerative potential during hair cycle and in response to wounding.
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) modulates cell plasticity and differentiation and its overactivation results in severe skin lesions in humans.
However, its physiological role in skin homeostasis and hair growth is unknown.
Reconstitution assays grafting primary keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts into nude mice and 3-D epidermal equivalents revealed a positive role for AhR in skin regeneration, epidermal differentiation, and stem cell maintenance.
Furthermore, lack of receptor expression in AhR-/- mice delayed morphogenesis and impaired hair regrowth with a phenotype closely correlating with a reduction in suprabasal bulge stem cells (alpha6low CD34+ ).
Moreover, RNA-microarray and RT-qPCR analyses of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-isolated bulge stem cells revealed that AhR depletion impaired transcriptional signatures typical of both epidermal progenitors and bulge stem cells but upregulated differentiation markers likely compromising their undifferentiated phenotype.
Altogether, our findings support that AhR controls skin regeneration and homeostasis by ensuring epidermal stem cell identity and highlights this receptor as potential target for the treatment of cutaneous pathologies.

Mechanotransductive Differentiation of Hair Follicle Stem Cells Derived from Aged Eyelid Skin into Corneal Endothelial-Like Cells.
"Corneal endothelial insufficiency is one of the leading causes of blindness.
The main contemporary treatment for corneal blindness is endothelial keratoplasty, which, however, is unsatisfactory as a medical therapy due to the lack of donor corneas and graft rejection.
Therefore, autologous stem cell-based corneal endothelial tissue substitutes may be a promising alternative to conventional grafts in the future.
To address the age of most patients suffering from corneal endothelial deficiencies, we investigated the presence and potential of hair-derived stem cells from older tissue donors.
Our studies revealed the presence of pluripotency- and neural crest-associated markers in tissue sections from blepharoplasty patients aged 50 to 80 years.
In vitro outgrowths from eyelid hair follicles on collagen-coated tissue culture plates revealed a weak decrease in stem-cell potency.
In contrast, cells within the spheres that spontaneously formed from the adherent cell layer retained full stem-cell potency and could be differentiated into cells of the ecto- meso and endodermal lineages.', Although these highly potent hair follicle derived stem cells (HFSC) were only very slightly expandable, they were able to recognize the biomimicry of the Descemet's-like topography and differentiate into corneal endothelial-like cells., 'In conclusion, HFSCs derived from epidermal skin of eyelid biopsies are a promising cell source to provide autologous corneal endothelial replacement for any age group of patients."

Dexpanthenol Promotes Cell Growth by Preventing Cell Senescence and Apoptosis in Cultured Human Hair Follicle Cells.
Dexpanthenol (D-panthenol) is a precursor of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) and is widely used for dietary supplements and topical applications.
D-panthenol has long been used in hair care products for the purpose of anti-hair loss, its effects and the underlying mechanisms, however, were barely reported.
In this study, the effects of D-panthenol on human hair follicle cells, including dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and outer root sheath cells (hORSCs), were investigated.
D-panthenol enhanced the cell viability, increasing the cellular proliferation marker Ki67 in cultured hDPCs.
The markers for apoptosis (Caspase3/9) and cell senescence (p21/p16), reported to be expressed in aged or resting phase follicles, were significantly reduced by D-panthenol.
Anagen-inducing factors (ALP; beta-catenin; versican), which trigger or elongate the anagen phase, were stimulated by D-panthenol.
On the other hand, D-panthenol reduced TGF-beta1 expressions in both mRNA and protein levels.
The expression of VEGF, which is important for peripheral blood vessel activation; was up-regulated by D-panthenol treatment.
In cultured hORSCs, cell proliferation and viability were enhanced, while the mRNA expression of cell senescence markers (p21/p16) was significantly down-regulated.
The expressions of both VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR) were up-regulated by D-panthenol.
In conclusion, our data suggest that the hair growth stimulating activity of D-panthenol was exerted by increasing the cell viability, suppressing the apoptotic markers, and elongating the anagen phase in hair follicles.

Mapping hair follicle-targeted delivery by particle systems: What has science accomplished so far?
The importance of the hair follicle in the process of cutaneous drug penetration has been established since this skin appendage was recognized as an entry point for topically applied substances.
A comprehensive review on the hair follicle as a target per se is here provided, exploring the current knowledge on both targeted regions and delivery systems that take advantage of this permeation route.
The follicular penetration is a complex process, whose effectiveness and efficiency strongly depends on a diversity of different factors including follicular density and size, activity status of hair follicles and physicochemical properties of the topically applied substances.
Nanocarriers represent a heterogeneous assembly of molecules organized into particles and they have revolutionized drug delivery in several areas of medicine, pharmacology and cosmetics.
As they possess an inherent ability to use the follicular route, they are reviewed here having in perspective the hair follicle zones that they are able to reach as reported.
In this way, a follicular road map for the different delivery systems was compiled to assist as a guiding tool for those that have interest in the development and/or application of such delivery systems for hair and skin treatment or care.

Essential Role of STAT3 Signaling in Hair Follicle Homeostasis.
Dominant-negative mutations associated with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, which controls epithelial proliferation in various tissues, lead to atopic dermatitis in hyper IgE syndrome.
This dermatitis is thought to be attributed to defects in STAT3 signaling in type 17 helper T cell specification.
However, the role of STAT3 signaling in skin epithelial cells remains unclear.
We found that STAT3 signaling in keratinocytes is required to maintain skin homeostasis by negatively controlling the expression of hair follicle-specific keratin genes.
These expression patterns correlated with the onset of dermatitis, which was observed in specific pathogen-free conditions but not in germ-free conditions, suggesting the involvement of Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses.
Thus, our study suggests that STAT3-dependent gene expression in keratinocytes plays a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of skin, which is constantly exposed to microorganisms.

Polycomb repressive complex 2 in adult hair follicle stem cells is dispensable for hair regeneration.
Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are multipotent cells that cycle through quiescence and activation to continuously fuel the production of hair follicles.
Prior genome mapping studies had shown that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), the chromatin mark mediated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), is dynamic between quiescent and activated HFSCs, suggesting that transcriptional changes associated with H3K27me3 might be critical for proper HFSC function.
However, functional in vivo studies elucidating the role of PRC2 in adult HFSCs are lacking.
In this study, by using in vivo loss-of-function studies we show that, surprisingly, PRC2 plays a non-instructive role in adult HFSCs and loss of PRC2 in HFSCs does not lead to loss of HFSC quiescence or changes in cell identity.
Interestingly, RNA-seq and immunofluorescence analyses of PRC2-null quiescent HFSCs revealed upregulation of genes associated with activated state of HFSCs.
Altogether, our findings show that transcriptional program under PRC2 regulation is dispensable for maintaining HFSC quiescence and hair regeneration.

Genome-Wide Selective Signatures Reveal Candidate Genes Associated with Hair Follicle Development and Wool Shedding in Sheep.
Hair follicle development and wool shedding in sheep are poorly understood.
This study investigated the population structures and genetic differences between sheep with different wool types to identify candidate genes related to these traits.
We used Illumina ovine SNP 50K chip genotyping data of 795 sheep populations comprising 27 breeds with two wool types, measuring the population differentiation index (Fst), nucleotide diversity (thetapi ratio), and extended haplotype homozygosity among populations (XP-EHH) to detect the selective signatures of hair sheep and fine-wool sheep.
The top 5% of the Fst and thetapi ratio values, and values of XP-EHH < -2 were considered strongly selected SNP sites.
Annotation showed that the PRX, SOX18, TGM3, and TCF3 genes related to hair follicle development and wool shedding were strongly selected.
Our results indicated that these methods identified important genes related to hair follicle formation, epidermal differentiation, and hair follicle stem cell development, and provide a meaningful reference for further study on the molecular mechanisms of economically important traits in sheep.

Growth Hormone and the Human Hair Follicle.
"Ever since the discoveries that human hair follicles (HFs) display the functional peripheral equivalent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, exhibit elements of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, and even generate melatonin and prolactin, human hair research has proven to be a treasure chest for the exploration of neurohormone functions.
However, growth hormone (GH), one of the dominant neurohormones of human neuroendocrine physiology, remains to be fully explored in this context.
This is interesting since it has long been appreciated clinically that excessive GH serum levels induce distinct human skin pathology.
Acromegaly, or GH excess, is associated with hypertrichosis, excessive androgen-independent growth of body hair, and hirsutism in females, while dysfunctional GH receptor-mediated signaling (Laron syndrome) is associated with alopecia and prominent HF defects.
The outer root sheath keratinocytes have recently been shown to express functional GH receptors.', Furthermore, and contrary to its name, recombinant human GH is known to inhibit female human scalp HFs' growth ex vivo, likely via stimulating the expression of the catagen-inducing growth factor, TGF-beta2., 'These limited available data encourage one to systematically explore the largely uncharted role of GH in human HF biology to uncover nonclassical functions of this core neurohormone in human skin physiology."

Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals the Molecular Anatomy of Sheep Hair Follicle Heterogeneity and Wool Curvature.
"Wool is the critical textile raw material which is produced by the hair follicle of sheep.
Therefore, it has important implications to investigate the molecular mechanism governing hair follicle development.
Due to high cellular heterogeneity as well as the insufficient cellular, molecular, and spatial characterization of hair follicles on sheep, the molecular mechanisms involved in hair follicle development and wool curvature of sheep remains largely unknown.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have made it possible to comprehensively dissect the cellular composition of complex skin tissues and unveil the differentiation and spatial signatures of epidermal and hair follicle development.
However, such studies are lacking so far in sheep.
Here, single-cell suspensions from the curly wool and straight wool lambskins were prepared for unbiased scRNA-seq.
Based on UAMP dimension reduction analysis, we identified 19 distinct cell populations from 15,830 single-cell transcriptomes and characterized their cellular identity according to specific gene expression profiles.
Furthermore, novel marker gene was applied in identifying dermal papilla cells isolated in vitro.', By using pseudotime ordering analysis, we constructed the matrix cell lineage differentiation trajectory and revealed the dynamic gene expression profiles of matrix progenitors' commitment to the hair shaft and inner root sheath (IRS) cells., 'Meanwhile, intercellular communication between mesenchymal and epithelial cells was inferred based on CellChat and the prior knowledge of ligand-receptor pairs.
As a result, strong intercellular communication and associated signaling pathways were revealed.
Besides, to clarify the molecular mechanism of wool curvature, differentially expressed genes in specific cells between straight wool and curly wool were identified and analyzed.
Our findings here provided an unbiased and systematic view of the molecular anatomy of sheep hair follicle comprising 19 clusters; revealed the differentiation, spatial signatures, and intercellular communication underlying sheep hair follicle development; and at the same time revealed the potential molecular mechanism of wool curvature, which will give important new insights into the biology of the sheep hair follicle and has implications for sheep breeding."

The Effect of Botulinum Toxin on Hair Follicle Cell Regeneration Under Continuous Stress Conditions: a Pilot Animal Study.
We analyzed the effect of botulinum toxin (BTX) type A on the regeneration of hair follicle cells under continuous stress conditions.
Thirty 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were used, and hair loss was induced on their backs (10 control (CTL) mice, reared under normal conditions without stress; 10 mice, exposed to continuous stress (STRESS) by fixing in an enclosed space; 10 BTX + STRESS mice, injected subcutaneously with 1 IU of BTX (0.1 cc) where the hair follicles were removed under the same stress conditions).
There was less hair growth in the STRESS and BTX + STRESS groups compared to that in the CTL group at 2 weeks.
At 3 weeks, the telogen stage was mainly observed in the STRESS group whereas the anagen stage was observed in the CTL and BTX + STRESS groups.
A substantial increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells was observed in the STRESS group compared to that in the CTL and BTX + STRESS groups.
Substance P (SP) immunoreactivity cell levels increased in the STRESS group at 2 and 3 weeks compared to those in the BTX + STRESS group.
SP expression increased at 2 and 3 weeks in the STRESS group compared to that in the CTL and BTX + STRESS groups.
A delay in the regeneration cycle of the hair follicle cells occurred when stress was applied, and an almost normal regeneration cycle occurred when BTX was injected subcutaneously.
Therefore, BTX may be a positive indicator for hair loss treatment.

miR-1 Regulates Differentiation and Proliferation of Goat Hair Follicle Stem Cells by Targeting IGF1R and LEF1 Genes.
Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) play a significant role in hair development.
miR-1 has been reported as an important regulatory factor that affects hair follicle growth and development, but its regulatory mechanism on HFSC development remains unknown.
In this study, the molecular mechanism of miR-1 in regulating HFSC proliferation and differentiation was investigated.
High-throughput RNA-seq and integrated analysis were performed to identify differentially transcribed mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) in HFSCs co-cultured with dermal papilla cells (named dHFSCs) and control HFSCs.
We then determined the molecular function of miR-1 in HFSCs.
Compared with HFSCs, 13 differentially transcribed miRNAs were identified in dHFSCs.
The in vitro results indicated that the overtranscription of miR-1 inhibited HFSC proliferation, but enhanced HFSC differentiation by targeting IGF1R and LEF1 genes.
This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of HFSC development.

Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 expression alters the number of keratinocyte stem cells in the mouse hair follicle.
Hair follicles regenerate periodically by spontaneously undergoing cycles of growth, regression, and relative quiescence.
During the hair cycle, follicle stem cells residing in a specialized niche remain quiescent, and they are stimulated to proliferate throughout the growth phase of the hair follicle.
Although cell cycle regulators play a prominent role during the activation of hair follicle stem cells, the identity and the role of these regulators have not been confirmed.
Herein, we reported that stem cells located in the bulge region of the HF (BuSCs) express high levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) through the quiescent phase of the hair cycle.
Using gain- and loss-of-function studies, we have determined that the CDK4 protein level affects the number of BuSCs.
Transgenic expression of CDK4 in the bulge region of the hair follicles reduces the number of BuSCs, whereas CDK4 ablation resulted in an increasing number of BuSCs.
These results suggest that deregulation of CDK4 protein levels contributes to distorting the self-renewal/proliferation balance and, in turn, altering the number of BuSCs.

Exosomal miRNA-181a-5p from the cells of the hair follicle dermal papilla promotes the hair follicle growth and development via the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.
Exosomal miRNAs are verified critical biomarkers, which participate in several biological processes.
The growth and development of the hair follicle (HF) are typically controlled by the exosomal miRNAs via cell-to-cell communication.
This study identified a high expression of miR-181a-5p in the low-passage DPC-Exos (exosomes derived from dermal papilla cell), revealing the transportation patterns of the DPC-Exos-derived miR-181a-5p entering the HFSC (hair follicle stem cell).
The exosomal miR-181a-5p activates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by targeting the Wnt inhibitor WIF1 and thereby regulates the proteins and genes related to HF growth and development.
Moreover, the exosomal miR-181a-5p was found to suppress the HFSC apoptosis but promoted the HFSC proliferation.
The in vitro culture of the HF organ revealed that the exosomal miR-181a-5p possesses a positive role in hair growth.
Collectively, the exosomal miR-181a-5p affects the HF growth and development through the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.
The exosomal miR-181a-5p might, therefore, act as the novel biomarker and therapeutic target for treating hair-related diseases and wool production in mammals.

Low temperature mitigating the paclitaxel-induced damages in mouse cell and hair follicle model.
Scalp cooling is currently the most approved treatment to prevent alopecia due to chemotherapy for cancer.
Few reports can be available, and the mechanisms involved in scalp cooling were unclear.
The present work tries to reveal a preliminary inhibitory mechanism of scalp cooling on paclitaxel-induced alopecia.
The results found that low temperature enhanced local vasoconstriction to 0.32 (dimensionless diameter, @ 22  C) and the vascular diameter presented an oscillating attenuation, which led to the concentration reduction of chemotherapeutic drugs transported by blood flow.
Cooling significantly rescued M-HFK cells treated by paclitaxel, and the lower temperature for the better protection due to weakening the cytotoxicity in some extent.
Cell cycle results showed that the G0/G1 phase was arrested at low temperature (i.e.
22  C), which was beneficial to mitigate the effect of paclitaxel on the G2/M phase cycle and finally made the cell cycle return to normal.
Also, cold stimulation significantly increased the concentration of HSP70 more than 3 times (@22  C for 2h) compared with that of the control group, which means low temperature can protect cells from stresses.
Furtherly, Cooling reduced the number of PH3+ and Caspase-3+ cells in the hair follicle, and effectively inhibited the cell apoptosis in the vitro hair follicle and alopecia in the mice experiments.
The current work provides a basis for deeply understanding the chemotherapy-induced alopecia prevention with scalp cooling.

miR-129-5p Participates in Hair Follicle Growth by Targeting HOXC13 in Rabbit.
"Mammalian hair formation is critically determined by the growth of hair follicles (HF).
MiRNAs are crucial in the periodic development of hair follicles; they maintain epidermal homeostasis by targeting genes and influencing the activity of signaling pathways and related regulators.', Our study discovered miR-129-5p to be overexpressed in the skin of Angora rabbits during catagen, and was negatively correlated with HOXC13 expression (Pearson's R = -0.313, p < 0.05)., 'The dual-Luciferase reporter gene detection system and Western blotting confirmed that miR-129-5p targeted HOXC13.
In addition, miR-129-5p overexpression was found to significantly inhibit the expression of hair follicle development-related genes (HFDRGs), such as BCL2, WNT2, CCND1, and LEF1 (p < 0.01), and promoted the expression of SFRP2, TGF-beta1, and FGF2 (p < 0.01), which was the same as the knockdown of HOXC13.
In contrast, the knockout of miR-129-5p was the opposite, and it demonstrated similar results to the overexpression of HOXC13.
CCK8 and flow cytometry demonstrated that miR-129-5p mimics significantly promoted the apoptosis of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) and inhibited proliferation (p < 0.01), while the inhibitor was found to reduce the apoptosis of DPCs and promote proliferation (p < 0.01).
These results showed that miR-129-5p can participate in the periodic development of HF by targeting HOXC13, and it can induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of DPCs.
These results will help to understand the role and mechanism of miR-129-5p in the periodic development of HF, and will provide support for subsequent studies, not only providing a theoretical basis for genetically improving the quality of hair in animals in the future, but also a new theory and method for diagnosing and treating hair loss in humans."

Bioactive Small Molecule Enhances Skin Burn Wound Healing and Hair Follicle Regeneration by Activating PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway: A Preclinical Evaluation in Animal Model.
"Rational: A bioactive small molecule of precision medicine involves targeted therapies.
Shikonin, a herbal extract, is an active small molecule that is traditionally used in wound healing for its anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory properties.
Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the anti-inflammatory role of shikonin in skin burn wound healing and hair follicle regeneration and to identify molecular signaling pathways that promote the regeneration.
Method: A secondary skin burn model of mice was established by conventional method.
The burn wound was externally treated with shikonin ointment and excipient treated mice were used as controls.
Skin samples were taken on the day 3 and 7 after drug treatment and the dosage was unified in the experiments.
The wound healing process was observed by histopathological and immunofluorescence (IF) staining.', The proliferation of hair follicle cells in wound skin was tracked by 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridne (EdU) staining., 'The inflammatory factors at the wound healing site were quantified by polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
The PI3K/Akt, P65, Ki67 signaling proteins and Bax/BCL2 apoptosis proteins were studied by western blot analysis.
The functionality of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was tested using LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K.
Result: Shikonin treated mice group exhibited better and faster skin burn wound healing in comparison with the controls.
The proliferation of new skin cells and hair follicle regeneration in the wound site of the shikonin treated group was more active.
The recruitment of macrophages in shikonin treated group was inhibited inturn decreased the expression of inflammatory factors.
However, LY294002 inhibited the shikonin-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and affected the wound healing process.
Conclusion: In conclusion, this study strengthens the hypothesis that bioactive small molecule, shikonin, inhibits inflammation, promotes wound healing and has a significant protective effect on the deep hair follicles against burn skin injury by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."

Hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells differentiate into mature beating cardiomyocyte sheets on flexible substrates in vitro.
Cardiomyocytes have been differentiated from various stem cells such as human embryonic stem cells (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), but it is difficult to produce mature cardiomyocytes.
We showed rat hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells have pluripotency and produced mature beating cardiomyocyte sheets differentiated from rat HAP stem cells.
The upper parts of rat vibrissa hair follicles were cultured in 10% FBS DMEM and stained with antibodies of the ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm system to show the differentiation of multiple cell types.
Moreover, HAP stem cells were cultured under three different conditions to decide the most suitable culture conditions for making beating cardiomyocyte sheets.
The beating cardiomyocyte sheets were shown to be mature by staining sarcomere structures.
Isoproterenol alone and the combination of isoproterenol, activin A, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) effectively induced beating long-fiber cardiomyocytes, which formed beating sheets, only in the presence of all four agents.
Flexible substrates were essential for the differentiation of sheets of mature beating cardiomyocytes for HAP stem cells.
The features of the cardiomyocytes differentiated from HAP stem cells demonstrate they have clinical potential for heart regeneration.

Phyllanthus emblica Extract-loaded Transfersomes for Hair Follicle Targeting: Phytoconstituents, Characterization, and Hair Growth Promotion.
Phyllanthus emblica Linn.
(PE) has been used to promote hair growth for decades.
In this study, dried PE fruit powder was extracted, tested for biological activities, and loaded into transfersomes for hair follicle targeting.
Before lyophilization, PE fruit powder was extracted using 2 solvent systems, water and 30% ethanol.
The PE 30% ethanolic extract had higher antioxidant activity and total phenolic content than the PE aqueous extract.
However, the cytotoxicity of the PE 30% ethanolic extract was higher than that of PE aqueous extract.
As a result, the PE aqueous extract was analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and found that the major component of the PE aqueous extract was gallic acid.
Afterward, the PE aqueous extract was tested for its potential to activate the expression of genes involved in hair growth promotion in human keratinocytes.
At a non-toxic concentration (10 microg/mL), this extract promoted various growth factors comparable to 1% minoxidil.
PE-loaded transfersomes were prepared to deliver the PE aqueous extract to the hair follicle.
The particle size and polydispersity index of PE-loaded transfersomes were 228 nm and 0.25, respectively.
After 3 months of storage, the particle size at 4 C and 30 C was 218 nm and 241 nm, respectively, which was comparable to its initial size.
However, at 40 C, the particle size dramatically increased (315 nm).
The fluorescent agent, rhodamine B, was used to evaluate the potential of transfersomes to target hair follicles.
Rhodamine B transfersomes had better penetration and accumulation in hair follicles than rhodamine B solution.
To conclude, the PE aqueous extract, mainly composed of gallic acid, can activate hair growth gene expression.
The extract can be loaded into hair follicles targeting transfersomes.
Thus, PE-loaded transfersomes are a promising delivery system for hair follicle targeting to promote hair growth.

DNA Methylation Mediates lncRNA2919 Regulation of Hair Follicle Regeneration.
Hair follicles (HFs) are organs that periodically regenerate during the growth and development of mammals.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with crucial roles in many biological processes.
Our previous study identified that lncRNA2919 is highly expressed in catagen during the HF cycle.
In this study, the in vivo rabbit model was established using intradermal injection of adenovirus-mediated lncRNA2919.
The results showed that lncRNA2919 decreased HF depth and density and contributed to HF regrowth, thereby indicating that lncRNA2919 plays a negative role in HF regeneration.
Moreover, methylation levels of the lncRNA2919 promoter at different HF cycle stages were detected through bisulfite sequencing.
The key CpG site that negatively correlates with lncRNA2919 expression during the HF cycle was identified.
5-Aza-dc-induced demethylation upregulated lncRNA2919 expression, and the core promoter region of lncRNA2919 was verified on the basis of luciferase activity.
Furthermore, we found that DNA methylation could prevent the binding of EGR1 to the lncRNA2919 promoter region, thereby affecting the transcriptional expression of lncRNA2919.
Collectively, DNA methylation inhibits the transcriptional expression of lncRNA2919, which plays a vital role in the HF cycle and HF regrowth.
These findings contribute to the basic theory of epigenetics in HF biology and provide references for further research in HF disease treatment and animal wool production.

Reflectance spectroscopy for noninvasive evaluation of hair follicle stage.
Hair follicle offers an excellent model for systems biology and regenerative medicine.
So far, the stages of hair follicle growth have been evaluated by histological examination.
In this work, a noninvasive spectroscopy was proposed by measuring the diffuse reflectance of mouse skin and analyzing the melanin value.
Results show that the skin diffuse reflectance was relatively high when hair follicles were at the telogen stage and at the beginning of the anagen stage, and decreased with the progression of the anagen stage.
When the hair follicle entered into the catagen stage, the diffuse reflectance gradually increased.
The changes in the melanin content of skin had contrary dynamics.
Substages of the hair follicle cycle could be distinguished by comparing the changes in melanin value with the histological examination.
This study provided a new method for noninvasive evaluation of the hair follicle stage, and should be valuable for basic and therapeutic investigations on hair regeneration.

Paracrine crosstalk between human hair follicle dermal papilla cells and microvascular endothelial cells.
Human follicle dermal papilla cells (FDPC) are a specialized population of mesenchymal cells located in the skin.
They regulate hair follicle (HF) development and growth, and represent a reservoir of multipotent stem cells.
Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that HF cycling is associated with vascular remodeling.
Follicular keratinocytes release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that sustains perifollicular angiogenesis leading to an increase of follicle and hair size.
Furthermore, several human diseases characterized by hair loss, including Androgenetic Alopecia, exhibit alterations of skin vasculature.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HF vascularization remain largely unknown.
In vitro coculture approaches can be successfully employed to greatly improve our knowledge and shed more light on this issue.
Here we used Transwell-based co-cultures to show that FDPC promote survival, proliferation and tubulogenesis of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) more efficiently than fibroblasts.
Accordingly, FDPC enhance the endothelial release of VEGF and IGF-1, two well-known proangiogenic growth factors.
Collectively, our data suggest a key role of papilla cells in vascular remodeling of the hair follicle.

Fibroblast growth factor 5-short (FGF5s) inhibits the activity of FGF5 in primary and secondary hair follicle dermal papilla cells of cashmere goats.
To determine the relationship between fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) and FGF5-short (FGF5s) in dermal papilla cells of cashmere goat primary and secondary hair follicles.
We isolated dermal papilla cells from primary hair follicle (PHF) and secondary hair follicle (SHF) of cashmere goat, and found that the FGF5 receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), was expressed in these two types of dermal papilla cells.
Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of FGF5 could upregulate the mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), versican and noggin that were important for follicle growth maintenance, whereas downregulate the expression of anagen chalone bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) in dermal papilla cells.
However, these alterations were partly reversed by FGF5s overexpression.
In conclusion, our results demonstrated that FGF5s acted as an inhibitor of FGF5 in the regulation of anagen-catagen transition of cashmere goat dermal papilla cells.

Hair follicle transcriptome profiles during the transition from anagen to catagen in Cashmere goat (Capra hircus).
Previous molecular genetic studies of the goat hair life cycle have focused primarily on a limited number of genes and proteins.
To identify additional genes that may play important roles in hair follicle cycle regulation, Illumina sequencing technology was used to catalog differential gene expression profiles in the hair growth cycle (anagen to catagen) of goat, comparing the primary hair follicle with the secondary hair follicle.
There were 13,769 and 12,240 unigenes assembled from the reads obtained from primary hair follicle and secondary hair follicle, respectively.
Genes encoding keratin proteins and keratin-associated proteins were the most highly expressed.
A total of 5899 genes were differentially expressed in anagen vs catagen primary hair follicles, with 532 genes up-regulated and 5367 genes down-regulated.
A total of 5208 genes were differentially expressed in anagen vs catagen secondary hair follicle, including 545 genes that were up-regulated and 4663 genes that were down-regulated.
Numerous hair growth genes are expressed in the goat hair follicle, of which 73 genes showed co-up-regulation in both hair follicles during the anagen stage.
Many of these up-regulated genes, such as STC2, VEGFR, and ROR2, are known to be transfactors in the process of cell differentiation and in the cell cycle.
The differential gene expression profiles between primary hair follicles and secondary hair follicles obtained provide a foundation for future studies examining the network of gene expression controlling hair growth cycle in Cashmere goat.

Foxi3 Deficiency Compromises Hair Follicle Stem Cell Specification and Activation.
The hair follicle is an ideal system to study stem cell specification and homeostasis due to its well characterized morphogenesis and stereotypic cycles of stem cell activation upon each hair cycle to produce a new hair shaft.
The adult hair follicle stem cell niche consists of two distinct populations, the bulge and the more activation-prone secondary hair germ (HG).
Hair follicle stem cells are set aside during early stages of morphogenesis.
This process is known to depend on the Sox9 transcription factor, but otherwise the establishment of the hair follicle stem cell niche is poorly understood.
Here, we show that that mutation of Foxi3, a Forkhead family transcription factor mutated in several hairless dog breeds, compromises stem cell specification.
Further, loss of Foxi3 impedes hair follicle downgrowth and progression of the hair cycle.
Genome-wide profiling revealed a number of downstream effectors of Foxi3 including transcription factors with a recognized function in hair follicle stem cells such as Lhx2, Runx1, and Nfatc1, suggesting that the Foxi3 mutant phenotype results from simultaneous downregulation of several stem cell signature genes.
We show that Foxi3 displays a highly dynamic expression pattern during hair morphogenesis and cycling, and identify Foxi3 as a novel secondary HG marker.
Absence of Foxi3 results in poor hair regeneration upon hair plucking, and a sparse fur phenotype in unperturbed mice that exacerbates with age, caused by impaired secondary HG activation leading to progressive depletion of stem cells.
Thus, Foxi3 regulates multiple aspects of hair follicle development and homeostasis.

Neural Stem Cells Restore Hair Growth Through Activation of the Hair Follicle Niche.
Several types of hair loss result from the inability of hair follicles to initiate the anagen phase of the hair regeneration cycle.
Modulating signaling pathways in the hair follicle niche can stimulate entry into the anagen phase.
Despite much effort, stem cell-based or pharmacological therapies to activate the hair follicle niche have not been successful.
Here, we set out to test the effect of neural stem cell (NSC) extract on the hair follicle niche for hair regrowth.
NSC extracts were applied to the immortalized cell lines HaCaT keratinocytes and dermal papilla cells (DPCs) and the shaven dorsal skin of mice.
Treatment with NSC extract dramatically improved the growth of HaCaT keratinocytes and DPCs.
In addition, NSC extract enhanced the hair growth of the shaven dorsal skin of mice.
In order to determine the molecular signaling pathways regulated by NSCs, we evaluated the expression levels of multiple growth and signaling factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family members.
We found that treatment with an NSC extract enhanced hair growth by activating hair follicle niches via coregulation of TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways in the telogen phase.
We also observed activation and differentiation of intrafollicular hair follicle stem cells, matrix cells, and extrafollicular DPCs in vivo and in vitro.
We tested whether activation of growth factor pathways is a major effect of NSC treatment on hair growth by applying the growth factors to mouse skin.
Combined growth factors, including TGF-beta, significantly increased the hair shaft length and growth rate.
DNA damage and cell death were not observed in skin cells of mice treated with the NSC extract for a prolonged period.
Overall, our data demonstrate that NSC extract provides an effective approach for promoting hair growth by directly regulating hair follicle niches through TGF-beta and BMP signaling pathways as well as induction of core growth factors.

Introduction to Hair-Follicle-Associated Pluripotent Stem Cells.
Nestin-expressing stem cells of the hair follicle, discovered by our laboratory, have been shown to be able to form outer-root sheaths of the follicle as well as neurons and many other non-follicle cell types.
We have termed the nestin-expressing stem cells of the hair follicle as hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells.
We have shown that the HAP stem cells from the hair follicle can effect the repair of peripheral nerve and spinal cord injury.
The hair follicle stem cells differentiate into neuronal and glial cells after transplantation to the injured peripheral nerve and spinal cord, and enhance injury repair and locomotor recovery.
When the excised hair follicle with its nerve stump was placed in Gelfoam( ) 3D histoculture, HAP stem cells grew and extended the hair follicle nerve which consisted of betaIII-tubulin-positive fibers with F-actin expression at the tip.
These findings indicate that betaIII-tubulin-positive fibers elongating from the whisker follicle sensory nerve stump were growing axons.
The growing whisker sensory nerve was highly enriched in HAP stem cells, which appeared to play a major role in its elongation and interaction with other nerves in 3D Gelfoam( ) histoculture, including the sciatic nerve, the trigeminal nerve, and the trigeminal nerve ganglion.
These results suggest that a major function of the HAP stem cells in the hair follicle is for growth of the follicle sensory nerve.
Recently, we have shown that HAP stem cells can differentiate into beating cardiac muscle cells.
HAP stem cells have critical advantages for regenerative medicine over embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in that they are highly accessible from each patient, thereby eliminating immunological issues since they are autologous, require no genetic manipulation, are non-tumorigenic, and do not present ethical issues.

Hair Follicle Regeneration by Transplantation of a Bioengineered Hair Follicle Germ.
Hair follicle morphogenesis is first induced by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the developing embryo.
In the hair follicle, various stem-cell populations are maintained in specialized niches to promote repetitive hair follicle-morphogenesis, which is observed in the variable lower region of the hair follicle as a postnatal hair cycle.
In contrast, the genesis of most organs is induced only once during embryogenesis.
We developed a novel bioengineering technique, the Organ Germ Method, that employs three-dimensional stem cell culture for regenerating various organs and reproducing embryonic organogenesis.
In this chapter, we describe a protocol for hair follicle germ reconstitution using adult follicle-derived epithelial stem cells and dermal papilla cells with intracutaneous transplantation of the bioengineered hair-follicle organ germ.
This protocol can be useful not only for the clinical study of hair regeneration but also for studies of stem cell biology and organogenesis.

Protocols for Cryopreservation of Intact Hair Follicle That Maintain Pluripotency of Nestin-Expressing Hair-Follicle-Associated Pluripotent (HAP) Stem Cells.
Hair follicles contain nestin-expressing pluripotent stem cells, the origin of which is above the bulge area, below the sebaceous gland.
We have termed these cells hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells.
Cryopreservation methods of the hair follicle that maintain the pluripotency of HAP stem cells are described in this chapter.
Intact hair follicles from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice were cryopreserved by slow-rate cooling in TC-Protector medium and storage in liquid nitrogen.
After thawing, the upper part of the hair follicle was isolated and cultured in DMEM with fetal bovine serum (FBS).
After 4 weeks culture, cells from the upper part of the hair follicles grew out.
The growing cells were transferred to DMEM/F12 without FBS.
After 1 week culture, the growing cells formed hair spheres, each containing approximately 1 x 10(2) HAP stem cells.
The hair spheres contained cells which could differentiate to neurons, glial cells, and other cell types.
The formation of hair spheres by the thawed and cultured upper part of the hair follicle produced almost as many pluripotent hair spheres as fresh follicles.
The hair spheres derived from cryopreserved hair follicles were as pluripotent as hair spheres from fresh hair follicles.
These results suggest that the cryopreservation of the whole hair follicle is an effective way to store HAP stem cells for personalized regenerative medicine, enabling any individual to maintain a bank of pluripotent stem cells for future clinical use.

Hypoxia Enhances Differentiation of Hair Follicle-Associated-Pluripotent (HAP) Stem Cells to Cardiac-Muscle Cells.
We have previously demonstrated that the neural stem-cell marker nestin is expressed in hair-follicle stem cells located in the bulge area which are termed hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells.
HAP stem cells from mouse and human could form spheres in culture, termed hair spheres, which are keratin 15-negative and nestin-positive and could differentiate to neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, and melanocytes in vitro.
Subsequently, we demonstrated that nestin-expressing stem cells could effect nerve and spinal cord regeneration in mouse models.
Recently, we demonstrated that HAP stem cells differentiated to beating cardiac muscle cells.
We recently observed that isoproterenol directs HAP stem cells to differentiate to cardiac-muscle cells in large numbers in culture compared to HAP stem cells not supplemented with isoproterenol.
The addition of activin A, bone morphogenetic protein 4, and basic fibroblast growth factor, along with isoproternal, induced the cardiac muscle cells to form tissue sheets of beating heart muscle cells.
In the present study, we report that, under hypoxic conditions, HAP stem cells differentiated to troponin-positive cardiac-muscle cells at a higher rate that under normoxic conditions.
Hypoxia did not influence the differentiation to other cell types.
For future use of HAP stem cells for cardiac muscle regeneration, hypoxia should enhance the rate of differentiation thereby providing patients more opportunities to use their own HAP stem cells which are easily accessible, for this purpose.

Multifaceted role of hair follicle dermal cells in bioengineered skins.
BACKGROUND: The method of generating bioengineered skin constructs was pioneered several decades ago; nowadays these constructs are used regularly for the treatment of severe burns and nonhealing wounds.
Commonly, these constructs are comprised of skin fibroblasts within a collagen scaffold, forming the skin dermis, and stratified keratinocytes overlying this, forming the skin epidermis.
In the past decade there has been a surge of interest in bioengineered skins, with researchers seeking alternative cell sources, or scaffolds, from which constructs can be established, and for more biomimetic equivalents with skin appendages.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether human hair follicle dermal cells can act as an alternative cell source for engineering the dermal component of engineered skin constructs.
METHODS: We established in vitro skin constructs by incorporating into the collagenous dermal compartment: (i) primary interfollicular dermal fibroblasts, (ii) hair follicle dermal papilla cells or (iii) hair follicle dermal sheath cells.
In vivo skins were established by mixing dermal cells and keratinocytes in chambers on top of immunologically compromised mice.
RESULTS: All fibroblast subtypes were capable of supporting growth of overlying epithelial cells, both in vitro and in vivo.
However, we found hair follicle dermal sheath cells to be superior to fibroblasts in their capacity to influence the establishment of a basal lamina.
CONCLUSIONS: Human hair follicle dermal cells can be readily interchanged with interfollicular fibroblasts and used as an alternative cell source for establishing the dermal component of engineered skin both in vitro and in vivo.

Activin A-induced signalling controls hair follicle neogenesis.
Acquisition of potent human dermal papilla (DP) cells that can induce hair follicle neogenesis is an overarching concern, and various approaches have been tried.
In an attempt to solve the problem, we previously introduced the three-dimensional (3D) culture of human DP cells and observed de novo formation of hair follicles when conducting a patch hair reconstitution assay using 3D cultured DP spheres with mouse epidermal cells.
In this study, we have subsequently focused our attention on activin A, one of the notably upregulated proteins in DP spheres compared with 2D cultured DP cells.
We then adopted a small interfering RNA-mediated gene knock-down approach and hair reconstitution assay to investigate the role of activin A.
We observed that human DP spheres with activin A knock-down are severely impaired in hair follicle neogenesis when combined with mouse epidermal cells.
In addition, activin receptor 2B (ActvR2B) knock-down mouse epidermal cells showed severe impairment of hair follicle neogenesis when combined with human DP spheres.
Moreover, recombinant activin A treatment of mouse epidermal cells increased the expression of downstream genes of the activin pathway.
Taken together, our data strongly suggest that activin A-induced signalling plays a critical role in hair follicle neogenesis, which has not been previously reported.

Immunohistochemical study of hair follicle stem cells in regenerated hair follicles induced by Wnt10b.
The regulation of the periodic regeneration of hair follicles is complicated.
Although Wnt10b has been reported to induce hair follicle regeneration, the characteristics of induced hair follicles, especially the target cells of Wnt10b, have not yet been clearly elucidated.
Thus, we systematically evaluated the expression and proliferation patterns of Wnt10b-induced hair follicles.
We found that Wnt10b promoted the proliferation of hair follicle stem cells from 24 hours after AdWnt10b injection.
Seventy-two hours after AdWnt10b injection, cells outside of bulge area began to proliferate.
When the induced hair follicle entered full anagen, although the hair follicle stem cells were normal, canonical Wnt signaling was maintained in the hair precortex cells.
Our results reveal that the target cells that overexpressed Wnt10b included hair follicle stem cells, hair precortex cells, and matrix cells.

Cryopreservation of Hair-Follicle Associated Pluripotent (HAP) Stem Cells Maintains Differentiation and Hair-Growth Potential.
Hair follicles contain nestin-expressing pluripotent stem cells which originate above the bulge area of the follicle, below the sebaceous gland.
We have termed these cells hair follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells.
We have established efficient cryopreservation methods of the hair follicle that maintain the pluripotency of HAP stem cells as well as hair growth.
We cryopreserved the whole hair follicle by slow-rate cooling in TC-Protector medium or in DMSO-containing medium and storage in liquid nitrogen or at -80  C. After thawing and culture of the cryopreserved whisker follicles, growing HAP stem cells formed hair spheres.
The hair spheres contained cells that differentiated to neurons, glial cells, and other cell types.
The hair spheres derived from slow-cooling cryopreserved hair follicles were as pluripotent as hair spheres from fresh hair follicles.
We have also previously demonstrated that cryopreserved mouse whisker hair follicles maintain their hair-growth potential.
DMSO better cryopreserved mouse whisker follicles compared to glycerol.
DMSO-cryopreserved hair follicles also maintained the HAP stem cells, evidenced by P75ntr expression.
Subcutaneous transplantation of DMSO-cryopreserved hair follicles in nude mice resulted in extensive hair fiber growth over 8 weeks, indicating the functional recovery of hair-shaft growth of cryopreserved hair follicles.
HAP stem cells can be used for nerve and spinal-cord repair.
This biobanking of hair follicles can allow each patient the potential for their own stem cell use for regenerative medicine or hair transplantation.

Dickkopf-1 is involved in dexamethasone-mediated hair follicle regression.
The stress-related neurohormones including glucocorticoids (GCs) are secreted by hair follicles (HFs), and GCs suppress murine hair growth in vivo.
In this study, we found that dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic GC, increased the expression of dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a known catagen inducer, in dermal papilla (DP) cells, but not in follicular keratinocytes.
The neutralizing DKK1 antibody significantly attenuated the Dex-induced inhibition of human hair shaft elongation.
In addition, the neutralizing Dkk1 antibody delayed Dex-induced catagen in mice.
Collectively, our data strongly suggest that stress-related neurohormones cause DP cells to secrete DKK1, thereby leading to stress-associated disturbances in hair growth.

VEGF165 induces differentiation of hair follicle stem cells into endothelial cells and plays a role in in vivo angiogenesis.
"Within the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of five subtypes, VEGF165 secreted by endothelial cells has been identified to be the most active and widely distributed factor that plays a vital role in courses of angiogenesis, vascularization and mesenchymal cell differentiation.
Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) can be harvested from the bulge region of the outer root sheath of the hair follicle and are adult stem cells that have multi-directional differentiation potential.
Although the research on differentiation of stem cells (such as fat stem cells and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells) to the endothelial cells has been extensive, but the various mechanisms and functional forms are unclear.', In particular, study on HFSCs' directional differentiation into vascular endothelial cells using VEGF165 has not been reported., 'In this study, VEGF165 was used as induction factor to induce the differentiation from HFSCs into vascular endothelial cells, and the results showed that Notch signalling pathway might affect the differentiation efficiency of vascular endothelial cells.
In addition, the in vivo transplantation experiment provided that HFSCs could promote angiogenesis, and the main function is to accelerate host-derived neovascularization.
Therefore, HFSCs could be considered as an ideal cell source for vascular tissue engineering and cell transplantation in the treatment of ischaemic diseases."

Effect of sinapic acid on hair growth promoting in human hair follicle dermal papilla cells via Akt activation.
Hair loss known as alopecia is caused by abnormal hair follicle cycling including shortening of the anagen (growth) phase and changing of hair follicle morphology with miniaturization.
In accordance with the life extension, the quality of life is considered to be a most important thing.
The yearning for healthy and beautiful hair and low self esteem due to hair loss had negative influence on the quality of life with psychosocial maladjustment.
The objective of this research was to identify new compound that can be used as a drug to promote hair growth.
We investigated whether the function of sinapic acid (SA) is able to promote hair growth in human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (hHFDPC).
We showed that treatment of SA in hHFDPC could induce proliferation and the activation of Akt signaling in HFDPC.
In addition, SA could stimulate the expressions of the several growth factors, insulin-like growth factor 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor for hair growth.
We showed that SA led to an increased level of phospho-GSK-3beta and beta-catenin accumulation in HFDPC.
Finally, the promoting effect of SA in hHFDPC cell growth occurred by the induction of cell cycle progression.
These results suggest that SA could be one of the potential candidate compounds for the treatment of alopecia by inducing hair growth through triggering the expressions of growth factors via activation of Akt and subsequent inactivation of GSK-3beta /beta-catenin pathway.

Hair-follicle Transplant Into Chronic Ulcers: A New Graft Concept.
Chronic venous leg ulcers are a major therapeutic challenge in clinical practice, and the search for new approaches to improve wound healing is essential.
Many ulcers do not heal with traditional treatment using compression, debridement, and dressings.
Skin-grafts variants, such as pinch grafts, punch grafts, split- or full-thickness skin grafts, and grafts derived from cells cultured in the laboratory, are among the most widely used options in ulcers that do not heal.
In recent years, numerous studies have brought to our attention the important role of the hair follicle in the healing process of cutaneous wounds.
Putting knowledge into practice, hair follicles from the scalp have been used in punch-type grafts transplanted to the base of chronic ulcers to stimulate healing.
Results appear to be better than those with traditional hairless punch grafts, opening new lines of treatment for recalcitrant chronic venous ulcers.

Hair Follicle Terminal Differentiation Is Orchestrated by Distinct Early and Late Matrix Progenitors.
During development and regeneration, matrix progenitors undergo terminal differentiation to form the concentric layers of the hair follicle.
These differentiation events are thought to require signals from the mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP); however, it remains unclear how DP-progenitor cell interactions govern specific cell fate decisions.
Here, we show that the hair follicle differentiated layers are specified asynchronously, with early matrix progenitors initiating differentiation before surrounding the DP.
Furthermore, these early matrix cells can undergo terminal differentiation in the absence of Shh, BMP signaling, and DP maturation.
Whereas early matrix progenitors form the hair follicle companion layer, later matrix populations progressively form the inner root sheath and hair shaft.
Altogether, our findings characterize some of the earliest terminal differentiation events in the hair follicle and reveal that the matrix progenitor pool can be divided into early and late phases based on distinct temporal, molecular, and functional characteristics.

Effects of two chronic stresses on mental state and hair follicle melanogenesis in mice.
"Growing bodies of data show that psychological stress can be associated with hair loss and vitiligo.
Researchers have revealed that stress could indeed inhibit hair growth in vivo, but the relationship between chronic stress and melanogenesis remains unknown.
In this study, we established two types of stress models, chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) mice models, and explored the possible role of stress in mice hair follicle melanogenesis.
We found that stress changed hippocampal morphology, decreased 5-HT level in brain and skin and down-regulated 5-HT1A receptor expression in hippocampal CA1 region and skin.
The alterations of 5-HT and 5-HT1A receptor might be a threshold of central stress to associate with the behaviour changes.
Both two stresses caused cellular damage of melanocytes and inhibition of keratinocytes proliferation in HF, which made the synthetic pigment loss.
CRS which was considered primarily as a psychological stressor had the lower melanin production in HF, as well as the level of 5-HT in skin was down-regulated more than those in CUMS group."

Aging in hair follicle stem cells and niche microenvironment.
Hair graying and hair loss are prominent and common characteristics of the elderly population.
In some individuals these processes can significantly impact their quality of life, leading to depression, anxiety and other serious mental health problems.
Accordingly, there has been much interest in understanding the complex physiological changes within the hair follicle in the aging individual.
It is now known that hair follicles represent a prototypical stem cell niche, where both micro- and macroenvironmental influences are integrated alongside stem cell-stem cell and stem cell-stem niche interactions to determine hair growth or hair follicle senescence.
Recent studies have identified imbalanced stem cell differentiation and altered stem cell activity as important factors during hair loss, indicating new avenues for the development of therapeutic agents to stimulate hair growth.
Here, we pull together the latest findings on the hair follicle stem cell niche and the multifactorial interactions underlying the various forms of hair loss.

Cathepsin B as a potential cystatin M/E target in the mouse hair follicle.
Deficiency of the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin M/E (Cst6) in mice leads to disturbed epidermal cornification, impaired barrier function, and neonatal lethality.
We report the rescue of the lethal skin phenotype of ichq (Cst6-deficient; Cst6-/-) mice by transgenic, epidermis-specific, reexpression of Cst6 under control of the human involucrin (INV) promoter.
Rescued Tg(INV-Cst6)Cst6ichq/ichq mice survive the neonatal phase, but display severe eye pathology and alopecia after 4 mo.
We observed keratitis and squamous metaplasia of the corneal epithelium, comparable to Cst6-/-Ctsl+/- mice, as we have reported in other studies.
We found the INV promoter to be active in the hair follicle infundibulum; however, we did not observe Cst6 protein expression in the lower regions of the hair follicle in Tg(INV-Cst6)Cst6ichq/ichq mice.
This result suggests that unrestricted activity of proteases is involved in disturbance of hair follicle biology, eventually leading to baldness.
Using quenched activity-based probes, we identified mouse cathepsin B (CtsB), which is expressed in the lower regions of the hair follicle, as an additional target of mouse Cst6.
These data suggest that Cst6 is necessary to control CtsB activity in hair follicle morphogenesis and highlight Cst6-controlled proteolytic pathways as targets for preventing hair loss.-Oortveld, M. A. W., van Vlijmen-Willems, I. M. J. J., Kersten, F. F. J., Cheng, T., Verdoes, M., van Erp, P. E. J., Verbeek, S., Reinheckel, T., Hendriks, W. J.

Skin transcriptome reveals the intrinsic molecular mechanisms underlying hair follicle cycling in Cashmere goats under natural and shortened photoperiod conditions.
The growth of cashmere exhibits a seasonal pattern arising from photoperiod change.
However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.
We profiled the skin transcriptome of six goats at seven time points during hair follicle cycling via RNA-seq.
The six goats comprised three goats exposed to a natural photoperiod and three exposed to a shortened photoperiod.
During hair cycle transition, 1713 genes showed differential expression, and 332 genes showed a pattern of periodic expression.
Moreover, a short photoperiod induced the hair follicle to enter anagen early, and 246 genes overlapped with the periodic genes.
Among these key genes, cold-shock domain containing C2 (CSDC2) was highly expressed in the epidermis and dermis of Cashmere goat skin, although its function in hair-follicle development remains unknown.
CSDC2 silencing in mouse fibroblasts resulted in the decreased mRNA expression of two key hair-follicle factors, leading to reduced cell numbers and a lower cell density.
Cashmere growth or molting might be controlled by a set of periodic regulatory genes.
The appropriate management of short light exposure can induce hair follicles to enter full anagen early through the activation of these regulators.
The CSDC2 gene is a potentially important transcription factor in the hair growth cycle.

Alkaline Ceramidase 1 Protects Mice from Premature Hair Loss by Maintaining the Homeostasis of Hair Follicle Stem Cells.
Ceramides and their metabolites are important for the homeostasis of the epidermis, but much remains unknown about the roles of specific pathways of ceramide metabolism in skin biology.
With a mouse model deficient in the alkaline ceramidase (Acer1) gene, we demonstrate that ACER1 plays a key role in the homeostasis of the epidermis and its appendages by controlling the metabolism of ceramides.
Loss of Acer1 elevated the levels of various ceramides and sphingoid bases in the skin and caused progressive hair loss in mice.
Mechanistic studies revealed that loss of Acer1 widened follicular infundibulum and caused progressive loss of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) due to reduced survival and stemness.
These results suggest that ACER1 plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of HFSCs, and thereby the hair follicle structure and function, by regulating the metabolism of ceramides in the epidermis.

In vivo monitoring of hair cycle stages via bioluminescence imaging of hair follicle NG2 cells.
Hair growth occurs periodically in a cycle that consists of three different phases: growth, regression, and resting.
The length of each phase is regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors throughout life, and influenced by physiological and pathological conditions.
Elongation of the resting phase and shortening of the growth phase occur during physiological ageing and in baldness, respectively.
In vivo discrimination of each phase of the hair cycle can be used to research for regeneration of hair follicles as well as to evaluate the efficacy of hair regrowth treatments in the same individual.
Here we show that NG2+ epithelial cells in the hair follicles encompass bulge stem cells, and that the number of hair follicle NG2 cells underwent dramatic changes during the hair cycle.
Transgenic rats with expression of firefly luciferase gene in NG2 cells were generated to monitor the hair cycle in vivo.
Hair follicle NG2 cells were clearly visualized via bioluminescence imaging to study each phase of the hair cycle in the rats, from infancy to old age.

Generation of full-thickness skin equivalents using hair follicle-derived primary human keratinocytes and fibroblasts.
Skin equivalents are increasingly used as human-based test systems for basic and preclinical research.
Most of the established skin equivalents are composed of primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts, isolated either from excised human skin or juvenile foreskin following circumcisions.
Although the potential of hair follicle-derived cells for the generation of skin equivalents has been shown, this approach normally requires microdissections from the scalp for which there is limited subject compliance or ethical approval.
In the present study, we report a novel method to isolate and cultivate keratinocytes and fibroblasts from plucked hair follicles that were then used to generate skin equivalents.
The procedure is non-invasive, inflicts little-pain, and may allow easy access to patient-derived cells without taking punch biopsies.
Overall, minor differences in morphology, ultrastructure, expression of important structural proteins, or barrier function were observed between skin equivalents generated from hair follicle-derived or interfollicular keratinocytes and fibroblasts.
Interestingly, improved basal lamina formation was seen in the hair follicle-derived skin equivalents.
The presented method here allows easy and non-invasive access to keratinocytes and fibroblasts from plucked hair follicles that may be useful particularly for the generation of skin disease equivalents.

Exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic fields emitted from mobile phones induced DNA damage in human ear canal hair follicle cells.
The aim of this study was to investigate effect of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) emitted from mobile phones on DNA damage in follicle cells of hair in the ear canal.
The study was carried out on 56 men (age range: 30-60 years old)in four treatment groups with n = 14 in each group.
The groups were defined as follows: people who did not use a mobile phone (Control), people use mobile phones for 0-30 min/day (second group), people use mobile phones for 30-60 min/day (third group) and people use mobile phones for more than 60 min/day (fourth group).
Ear canal hair follicle cells taken from the subjects were analyzed by the Comet Assay to determine DNA damages.
The Comet Assay parameters measured were head length, tail length, comet length, percentage of head DNA, tail DNA percentage, tail moment, and Olive tail moment.
Results of the study showed that DNA damage indicators were higher in the RFR exposure groups than in the control subjects.
In addition, DNA damage increased with the daily duration of exposure.
In conclusion, RFR emitted from mobile phones has a potential to produce DNA damage in follicle cells of hair in the ear canal.
Therefore, mobile phone users have to pay more attention when using wireless phones.

Functional anatomy of the hair follicle: The Secondary Hair Germ.
"The secondary hair germ (SHG)-a transitory structure in the lower portion of the mouse telogen hair follicle (HF)-is directly involved in anagen induction and eventual HF regrowth.
Some crucial aspects of SHG functioning and ontogenetic relations with other HF parts, however, remain undefined.
According to recent evidence (in contrast to previous bulge-centric views), the SHG is the primary target of anagen-inducing signalling and a source of both the outer root sheath (ORS) and ascending HF layers during the initial (morphogenetic) anagen subphase.
The SHG is comprised of two functionally distinct cell populations.
Its lower portion (originating from lower HF cells that survived catagen) forms all ascending HF layers, while the upper SHG (formed by bulge-derived cells) builds up the ORS.
The predetermination of SHG cells to a specific morphogenetic fate contradicts their attribution to the stem cell category and supports SHG designation as a germinative or a founder cell population.
The mechanisms of this predetermination driving transition of the SHG from refractory to the competent state during the telogen remain unknown.
Functionally, the SHG serves as a barrier, protecting the quiescent bulge stem cell niche from the extensive follicular papilla/SHG signalling milieu.
The formation of the SHG is a prerequisite for efficient precommitment of these cells and provides for easier sensing and a faster response to anagen-inducing signals.
In general, the formation of the SHG is an evolutionary adaptation, which allowed the ancestors of modern Muridae to acquire a specific, highly synchronized pattern of hair cycling."

Culture of the human pilosebaceous unit, hair follicle and sebaceous gland.
Terence Kealey first pioneered the isolation and organ maintenance of human eccrine and sebaceous glands in the early to mid-1980.
This led to subsequent methods describing the isolation and culture of human hair follicles, the human pilosebaceous unit as well as the sebaceous duct.
The importance of these models in the study of the biology of human skin glands and appendages has been demonstrated in numerous publications and their importance as models for animal replacement, refinement and reduction (3Rs) is increasingly important.
In particular, in vitro (ex vivo) hair follicle culture has played a significant part in helping elucidate the role of signalling molecules in regulating hair growth and hair fibre formation and has been especially useful in understanding metabolic aspects of hair growth.
However, obtaining sufficient numbers of hair follicles is becoming increasingly difficult as plastic surgery becomes less invasive and smaller skin samples provided.
There is therefore an urgent requirement for the next generation of in vitro models using cell lines and tissue engineering, and this has led to the development of immortalised cell lines as well as attempts to model hair follicle embryogenesis in vitro and development of skin on a chip.

Macrophages Promote Wound-Induced Hair Follicle Regeneration in a CX3CR1- and TGF-beta1-Dependent Manner.
Hair follicle stem cells are regulated by intrafollicular and extrafollicular niche signals.
Appropriate hair follicle regeneration relies on the coordinated release and integration of these signals.
How immune cells, particularly cutaneous macrophages, influence the hair follicle stem cell niche and regeneration is not well understood.
We took advantage of wound-induced hair growth (WIHG) to explore the relationship between wound macrophages and hair follicle regeneration.
First, we showed that WIHG is dependent on CD11b+F4/80+ macrophages at 7-11 days after injury.
Next, using CX3CR1gfp/+:CCR2rfp/+ mice to capture the dynamic spectrum of macrophage phenotypes during wound healing, we showed that wound macrophages transition from a CX3CR1lo/med to a CX3CR1hi phenotype at the onset of WIHG.
Finally, WIHG is abolished in mice deficient for CX3CR1, delayed with pharmacological inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta receptor type 1, and rescued with exogenous transforming growth factor-beta1.
Overall, we propose a model in which transforming growth factor-beta1 and CX3CR1 are critical for recruiting and maintaining the CCR2+CX3CR1hiLy6CloTNFalpha+ macrophages critical for stimulating WIHG.

Costunolide promotes the proliferation of human hair follicle dermal papilla cells and induces hair growth in C57BL/6 mice.
BACKGROUND: Costunolide (COS), a naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactone, is known to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer effects.
This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of costunolide on the promotion of hair growth.
METHODS: Real-time cell analyzer (RTCA), measurement of 5alpha-reductase activity, mRNA expression, and Western blotting were adopted to address whether COS can stimulate the proliferation of human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (hHFDPCs).
The effect of COS on in vivo hair growth was examined by reconstitution assay and shaven dorsal skin in C57BL/6 mice.
RESULTS: Costunolide significantly promoted the proliferation of hHFDPCs, which is comparable to that of tofacitinib.
COS also inhibited the 5alpha-reductase activity in hHFDPCs.
While COS increased the level of beta-catenin and Gli1 mRNA and proteins, it suppressed transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced phosphorylation of Smad-1/5 in hHFDPCs.
COS increased the number of cultured hHFDPCs to induce hair follicles from mouse epidermal cells in Spheres formation of reconstitution assay.
Topical application of COS on the shaven back of C57BL/6 mice significantly improved the hair growth.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate that COS promotes hair growth in vitro and in vivo by regulating the amount of growth factors and/or the activity of cellular responses through coordination of the WNT-beta-catenin, hedgehog-Gli, and TGF-beta1-Smad pathways.

Balance between fibroblast growth factor 10 and secreted frizzled-relate protein-1 controls the development of hair follicle by competitively regulating beta-catenin signaling.
Growth of hairs depends on the regular development of hair follicles which are hypothesized to be regulated by fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) and secreted frizzled-relate protein-1 (sFRP1).
In the current study, the effect of FGF10 or sFRP1 on hair follicle cells was assessed and the possible mechanism mediating the interaction between FGF10 and sFRP1 in hair follicle cells was explored.
Out root sheath (ORS) and dermal papilla (DP) cells were isolated from mink skin tissues and subjected to administrations of FGF10 (50 ng/ml) or sFRP1 (10 ng/ml).
Then proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and migration potentials of both cell types were detected.
Moreover, the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin was determined.
The results showed that the administration of FGF10 increased cell proliferation and migration potential in both cell types, which was associated with the up-regulated nuclear level of beta-catenin.
To the contrary, the administration of sFRP1 decreased cell proliferation and migration potentials while induced the G1 cell cycle arrest in both cell types by inhibiting nuclear translocation of beta-catenin.
Compared with the sole administrations, the co-treatment of FGF10 and sFRP1 had a medium effect on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, cell migration, and nuclear beta-catenin level, representing an antagonistic interaction between the two factors, which was exerted by competitively regulating beta-catenin pathway.
Conclusively, the cycle of hair follicles was promoted by FGF10 while blocked by sFRP1 and the interplay between the two factors controlled the development of hair follicles by competitively regulating beta-catenin signaling.

External light activates hair follicle stem cells through eyes via an ipRGC-SCN-sympathetic neural pathway.
"Changes in external light patterns can alter cell activities in peripheral tissues through slow entrainment of the central clock in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).
It remains unclear whether cells in otherwise photo-insensitive tissues can achieve rapid responses to changes in external light.', Here we show that light stimulation of animals' eyes results in rapid activation of hair follicle stem cells with prominent hair regeneration., 'Mechanistically, light signals are interpreted by M1-type intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which signal to the SCN via melanopsin.
Subsequently, efferent sympathetic nerves are immediately activated.
Increased norepinephrine release in skin promotes hedgehog signaling to activate hair follicle stem cells.
Thus, external light can directly regulate tissue stem cells via an ipRGC-SCN autonomic nervous system circuit.
Since activation of sympathetic nerves is not limited to skin, this circuit can also facilitate rapid adaptive responses to external light in other homeostatic tissues."

Loss of Gata6 causes dilation of the hair follicle canal and sebaceous duct.
The uppermost aspect of the hair follicle, known as the infundibulum or hair canal, provides a passageway for hair shaft egress and sebum secretion.
Recent studies have indicated that the infundibulum and sebaceous ducts are lined by molecularly distinct differentiated cells expressing markers including Keratin 79 and Gata6.
Here, we ablated Gata6 from the skin and observed dilation of both the hair canal and sebaceous ducts, independent of gender and hair cycle stage.
Constitutive loss of Gata6 yielded only a mild delay in depilation-induced entry into anagen, while unperturbed mutant mice possessed overtly normal skin and hair.
Furthermore, we noted that Keratin 79 and Gata6 expression and localization did not depend upon each other.
Our findings implicate Gata6 in maintaining the upper hair follicle and suggest that regulation of this transcription factor may be compromised in pathologies such as acne or infundibular cystic diseases that are characterized by abnormal expansion of this follicular domain.

Dengue Virus Infects Primary Human Hair Follicle Dermal Papilla Cells.
During the epidemic of the dengue virus (DENV) infection in Taiwan in 2014 and 2015, we observed an abnormally high frequency of increased scalp hair shedding in infected individuals that could not be explained by telogen effluvium.
In this study, the mechanism of hair loss caused by DENV was explored.
Human hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) are essential for hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling.
Thus, we established an in vitro DENV infection model in HFDPCs.
On immunofluorescence analysis, HFDPCs that were susceptible to DENV infection responded to type I interferon (IFN) treatment, and the cells showed antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect.
The expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), revealed an inflammatory response in DENV-infected HFDPCs.
In particular, DENV infection impaired cell viability, and it activated caspase-associated cell death signaling in HFDPCs.
In conclusion, our data indicate that direct infection with DENV causes inflammation and cell death in HFDPCs, which is involved in the mechanisms of hair loss after DENV infection.
The knowledge of DENV infection in an immune-privileged tissue, such as hair follicles, may suggest their use for further studies on post-dengue fatigue syndrome (PDFS).

Skin-permeable liposome improved stability and permeability of bFGF against skin of mice with deep second degree scald to promote hair follicle neogenesis through inhibition of scar formation.
Excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) usually resulted in scar formation during wound healing, which caused skin dysfunction, such as hair loss.
Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was very helpful for promoting hair follicle neogenesis and regulating the remodeling of ECM during wound healing.
Because of its poor stability in wound fluids and low permeability against the dense wound scar, the repairing quality of bFGF on wound was hindered largely in clinical practice.
To overcome these drawbacks, herein, a novel liposome with silk fibroin hydrogel core (bFGF-SF-LIP) was firstly prepared to stabilize bFGF, followed by insertion of laurocapam, a permeation enhancer, into the liposomal membrane to construct a skin-permeable liposome (SP-bFGF-SF-LIP).
The encapsulated efficiency of bFGF was reaching to nearly 90% when ratio of drug/lipids above 1:300, and it activity was not compromised by laurocapam.
SP-bFGF-SF-LIP exhibited a hydrodynamic diameter of 103.3 nm and Zeta potential of -2.31 mV.
The stability of the encapsulated bFGF in wound fluid was obviously enhanced.
After 24 h of incubation with wound fluid containing MMP-9, the remaining bFGF was as high as 65.4 +- 0.5% for SP-bFGF-SF-LIP, while only 2.1 +- 0.2% of free bFGF was remained.
The skin-permeability of bFGF was significantly enhanced by SP-bFGF-SF-LIP and most of the encapsulated bFGF penetrated into the dermis.
After treatment with SP-bFGF-SF-LIP, the morphology of hair follicle at wound zone was obviously improved and the hair regrew on the deep second scald mice model.
The therapeutic mechanism was highly associated with inhibiting scar formation and promoting vascular growth in dermis.
Conclusively, SP-bFGF-SF-LIP may a potential option to improve wound healing with high-quality.

Sirtuin-1 protects hair follicle stem cells from TNFalpha-mediated inflammatory stress via activating the MAPK-ERK-Mfn2 pathway.
OBJECTIVE: Stem cell transplantation is a promising tool to treat burn injuries.
However, the inflammatory microenvironment in damaged skin limits the efficiency of stem cell-based therapy via poorly understood mechanisms.
The aim of our study is to explore the contribution and mechanism of Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) in TNFalpha-mediated inflammatory stress in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs).
METHODS: Cellular viability was determined using the MTT assay, TUNEL staining, western blot analysis and LDH release assay.
Adenovirus-loaded Sirt1 was transduced into HFSCs to overexpress Sirt1 in the presence of TNFalpha.
Mitochondrial function was determined using JC-1 staining, mitochondrial ROS staining, immunofluorescence staining and western blotting.
RESULTS: Sirt1 was downregulated in response to the TNFalpha treatment.
Additionally, TNFalpha stress reduced the viability, mobility and proliferation of HFSCs, and these effects were reversed by the overexpression of Sirt1.
At the molecular level, Sirt1 overexpression attenuated TNFalpha-mediated mitochondrial damage, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial energy metabolism, decreased mitochondrial ROS generation, stabilized mitochondrial potential and blockage of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
Furthermore, Sirt1 modulated mitochondrial homeostasis by activating the MAPK-ERK-Mfn2 axis; inhibition of this pathway abrogated the protective effects of Sirt1 on HFSC survival, migration and proliferation.
SIGNIFICANCE: Based on our results, the inflammatory stress-mediated HFSC injury may be associated with a decrease in Sirt1 expression and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction.
Accordingly, strategies designed to enhance Sirt1 expression would be an effective approach to enhance the survival of HFSCs in the inflammatory microenvironment.

Extracellular proteoglycan decorin maintains human hair follicle stem cells.
Hair follicle stem cells (HFSC) are localized in the bulge region of the hair follicle and play a role in producing hair.
Recently, it has been shown that the number of HFSC decreases with age, which is thought to be a cause of senile alopecia.
Therefore, maintaining HFSC may be key for the prevention of age-related hair loss, but the regulatory mechanisms of HFSC and the effects of aging on them are largely unknown.
In general, stem cells are known to require regulatory factors in the pericellular microenvironment, termed the stem cell niche, to maintain their cell function.
In this study, we focused on the extracellular matrix proteoglycan decorin (DCN) as a candidate factor for maintaining the human HFSC niche.
Gene expression analysis showed that DCN was highly expressed in the bulge region.
We observed decreases in DCN expression as well as the number of KRT15-positive HFSC with age.
In vitro experiments with human plucked hair-derived HFSC revealed that HFSC lost their undifferentiated state with increasing passages, and prior to this change a decrease in DCN expression was observed.
Furthermore, knockdown of DCN promoted HFSC differentiation.
In contrast, when HFSC were cultured on DCN-coated plates, they showed an even more undifferentiated state.
From these results, as a novel mechanism for maintaining HFSC, it was suggested that DCN functions as a stem cell niche component, and that the deficit of HFSC maintenance caused by a reduction in DCN expression could be a cause of age-related hair loss.

Transcriptomic analysis reveals critical genes for the hair follicle of Inner Mongolia cashmere goat from catagen to telogen.
"There are two main types of hair follicle in Inner Mongolia Cashmere goats, the primary hair follicle (PHF) producing hair fibers and the secondary hair follicle (SHF) producing cashmere fibers.
Of both fibers from cashmere-bearing goats in Aerbasi, Inner Mongolia, the timing of cyclical phases for the cashmere have been well clarified but hair fibers have been less noticeable.
Herein, we evaluated transcriptome of PHF and SHF from the same three goats in Aerbasi at the catagen- and telogen phase of cashmere growth.
We totally found 1977 DEGs between PHFs at the telogen and catagen phases of SHF, 1199 DEGs between telogen- and catagen SHF, 2629 DEGs between PHF at the catagen phase of SHF and catagen SHF, and 755 DEGs between PHF at the telogen phase of SHF and telogen SHF.
By analyzing gene functions based on GO and KEGG database, we found that the DEGs have functions in muscle contraction and muscle filament sliding between catagen- and telogen SHF, indicating that arrector pilli muscles might play a role on the transition from catagen to telogen.', Moreover, considering that the enriched GO and KEGG categories of the DEGs between PHF and SHF, we suggested that part of PHF might rest in their own anagen phase when SHF are at catagen, but PHF might enter into the telogen phase at SHF's telogen., 'Finally, we highly recommended the several potential genes acting as the regulators of the transition between growth phases including IL17RB and eight members of ZNF.', These results provide insight into molecular mechanisms on the transition of SHF from catagen to telogen together with PHF's growth situation at SHF's catagen and telogen in Inner Mongolia Cashmere goats.]"

Hair Follicle-Associated Pluripotent(HAP) Stem Cells.
The hair follicle has been known, since 1990, to contain stem cells located in the bulge area.
In 2003, we reported a new type of stem cell in the hair follicle that expresses the brain stem-cell marker nestin.
We have termed these cells as hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells.
HAP stem cells can differentiate into neuronal and glial cells, beating cardiac-muscle cells, and other cell types in culture.
HAP stem cells can be used for nerve and spinal-cord repair such that locomotor activity is recovered.
A major function in situ of the HAP stem cells is for growth of the hair follicle sensory nerve.
HAP stem cells have critical advantages over embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells for regenerative medicine in that they are highly accessible, require no genetic manipulation, are nontumorigenic, and do not present ethical issues.

This review may afford meaningful implications for HFSC treatment of wounds.
AREAS COVERED: We present the properties of HFSCs, analyze the possibility of HFSCs in wound healing, and sum up the recent studies into wound repair with HFSCs.
The details of HFSCs in wound healing have been discussed.
The possible mechanisms of wound healing with HFSCs have been elaborated.
Additionally, the factors that influence HFSCs in wound healing are also summarized.
EXPERT OPINION: Hair follicle stem cells are promising sources for wound healing.
However, a further understanding of human HFSCs and the safety use of HFSCs in clinical practice still remain in relative infancy.

Heat stress decreased hair follicle population in rex rabbits.
The aim of this study was conducted to investigate the effect of heat stress on the hair follicle population and related signalling pathways in rex rabbits.
Forty-eight rabbits were randomly divided into two groups: one group in a high ambient environment (32 +- 2 C, heat stress) and the other group with normal temperature (20 +- 2 C, control).
The results show that heat stress decreased the body weight gain and feed conversion rate, rabbit hair length and hair follicle density (p < 0.05).
Besides, heat stress suppressed the gene expression of noggin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1 receptor and protein expression of phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in rabbit skin (p < 0.05), while stimulated significantly the gene expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and BMP4 (p < 0.05).
Heat exposure did not alter significantly the gene expression of alkaline phosphatase, versican and hepatocyte growth factor compared with the control (p > 0.05).
In conclusion, noggin-BMP, IGF-1 and mTOR signalling pathways may be associated with the process of heat stress-repressing hair follicle development.

TSA restores hair follicle-inductive capacity of skin-derived precursors.
The genesis of the hair follicle relies on signals derived from mesenchymal cells in the dermis during skin morphogenesis and regeneration.
Multipotent skin-derived precursors (SKPs), which exhibit long term proliferation potential when being cultured in spheroids, have been shown to induce hair genesis and hair follicle regeneration in mice, implying a therapeutic potential of SKPs in hair follicle regeneration and bioengineering.
However, the hair-inductive property of SKPs declines progressively upon ex vivo culture expansion, suggesting that the expressions of the genes responsible for hair induction are epigenetically unstable.
In this study, we found that TSA markedly alleviated culture expansion induced SKP senescence, increased the expression and activity of alkaline phosphatase (AP) in the cells and importantly restored the hair inductive capacity of SKPs.
TSA increased the acetylation level of histone H3, including the K19/14 sites in the promoter regions of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) genes, which were associated with elevated gene expression and BMP signaling activity, suggesting a potential attribution of BMP pathway in TSA induced recovery of the hair inductive capacity of SKPs.

Melatonin promotes secondary hair follicle development of early postnatal cashmere goat and improves cashmere quantity and quality by enhancing antioxidant capacity and suppressing apoptosis.
Development of secondary hair follicles in early postnatal cashmere goats may be adversely affected by reactive oxygen species which cause oxidative stress.
Because melatonin is a potent antioxidant and scavenger of free radicals, this study explored the effects of melatonin on secondary hair follicle development and subsequent cashmere production.
It was found that the initiation of new secondary follicles in early postnatal Inner Mongolian cashmere goats of both melatonin-treated and control goats occurred in the first 10 weeks of age.
Melatonin promoted the initiation and maturation of secondary follicles and increased their population.
Importantly, the beneficial effect of melatonin on secondary follicle population remained throughout life.
As a result, melatonin increased cashmere production and improved its quality in terms of reduced fiber diameter.
The mechanisms underlying the role of melatonin on secondary follicle development included the enhancement of activities of antioxidant enzymes, for example, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), elevated total antioxidant capacity, and upregulated anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and downregulated expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax and caspase-3.
These results reveal that melatonin serves to promote secondary hair follicle development in early postnatal cashmere goats and expands our understanding of melatonin application in cashmere production.
Melatonin treatment led to an increase in both the quantity and quality of cashmere fiber.
This increased the textile value of the fibers and provided economic benefit.

miR-218-5p regulates skin and hair follicle development through Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway by targeting SFRP2.
The hair follicle is a complex biological system involved in a dynamic process governed by gene regulation.
MicroRNAs play a critical role in the regulation of gene expression.
We demonstrated that the expression of miR-218-5p and SFRP2 showed the opposite relationship in catagen and telogen phases and that miR-218-5p promoted the growth of hair shafts.
The luciferase reporter assays confirmed that SFRP2 is the direct target of miR-218-5p.
The expression of miR-218-5p may decrease the expression of SFRP2, which activates the Wnt signaling pathway, including the regulation of downstream genes and beta-catenin/T-cell-specific factor transcriptional activity.
Moreover, miR-218-5p enhanced apoptosis, but inhibition of miR-218-5p decreased apoptosis and inhibited RAB-9 cell proliferation.
In this study, we show that miR-218-5p positively regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by targeting SFRP2 and acts as a dynamic governor during skin and hair follicle development.

Advances in Regenerative Stem Cell Therapy in Androgenic Alopecia and Hair Loss: Wnt pathway, Growth-Factor, and Mesenchymal Stem Cell Signaling Impact Analysis on Cell Growth and Hair Follicle Development.
The use of stem cells has been reported to improve hair regrowth in several therapeutic strategies, including reversing the pathological mechanisms, that contribute to hair loss, regeneration of hair follicles, or creating hair using the tissue-engineering approach.
Although various promising stem cell approaches are progressing via pre-clinical models to clinical trials, intraoperative stem cell treatments with a one-step procedure offer a quicker result by incorporating an autologous cell source without manipulation, which may be injected by surgeons through a well-established clinical practice.
Many authors have concentrated on adipose-derived stromal vascular cells due to their ability to separate into numerous cell genealogies, platelet-rich plasma for its ability to enhance cell multiplication and neo-angiogenesis, as well as human follicle mesenchymal stem cells.
In this paper, the significant improvements in intraoperative stem cell approaches, from in vivo models to clinical investigations, are reviewed.
The potential regenerative instruments and functions of various cell populaces in the hair regrowth process are discussed.
The addition of Wnt signaling in dermal papilla cells is considered a key factor in stimulating hair growth.
Mesenchymal stem cell-derived signaling and growth factors obtained by platelets influence hair growth through cellular proliferation to prolong the anagen phase (FGF-7), induce cell growth (ERK activation), stimulate hair follicle development (beta-catenin), and suppress apoptotic cues (Bcl-2 release and Akt activation).

Ginsenoside Rb1 promotes the growth of mink hair follicle via PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta signaling pathway.
AIMS: Hair follicles play a critical role in the process of hair growth.
The dermal papilla cells (DPCs) are an important component in the hair follicle regeneration and growth.
This study investigated the effects of ginsenoside Rb1 on the growth of cultured mink hair follicles and DPCs.
MAIN METHODS: The mink hair follicles were treated with ginsenoside Rb1 for 9 days and their lengths were measured every three days.
Real-time PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression of vascularization endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) and TGF-beta1.
In addition, the levels of proteins were detected by western blot.
Cell proliferation was determined by immunofluorescence staining of proliferation marker Ki-67 and cell cycle analysis was performed on flow cytometry.
Moreover, cell migration was evaluated by wound healing assay.
KEY FINDINGS: Ginsenoside Rb1 promoted the growth of hair follicles, and proliferation and migration of DPCs.
Ginsenoside Rb1 improved the expression levels of VEGFA and VEGF-R2, while attenuated the TGF-beta1 expression both in hair follicles and DPCs.
Furthermore, ginsenoside Rb1 facilitated the activation of PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta signaling pathway in hair follicles and DPCs.
SIGNIFICANCE: The results reveals a crucial role of PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta signaling pathway in ginsenoside Rb1-induced growth of hair follicles and DPCs.

Preparation of hair beads and hair follicle germs for regenerative medicine.
Hair regenerative medicine is a promising approach for hair loss, during which autologous follicular stem cells are transplanted into regions of hair loss to regenerate hairs.
Because cells transplanted as a single cell suspension scarcely generate hairs, the engineering of three-dimensional (3D) tissues before transplantation has been explored to improve this process.
Here, we propose an approach to fabricate collagen-enriched cell aggregates, named hair beads (HBs), through the spontaneous constriction of cell-encapsulated collagen drops.
Mouse embryonic mesenchymal cells or human dermal papilla cells were encapsulated in 2-mul collagen microgels, which were concentrated >10-fold in volume during 3 days of culture.
Interestingly, HB constriction was attributed to attraction forces driven by myosin II and involved the upregulation of follicular genes.
Single HBs with epithelial cells seeded in U-shaped microwells formed dumbbell-like structures comprising respective aggregates (named bead-based hair follicle germs, bbHFGs), during 3 days of culture.
bbHFGs efficiently generated hair follicles upon intracutaneous transplantation into the backs of nude mice.
Using an automated spotter, this approach was scalable to prepare a large number of bbHFGs, which is important for clinical applications.
Therefore, this could represent a robust and practical approach for the preparation of germ-like tissues for hair regenerative medicine.

Up-regulated lncRNA5322 elevates MAPK1 to enhance proliferation of hair follicle stem cells as a ceRNA of microRNA-19b-3p.
Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), located in the bulge region of the follicle, maintain hair follicle growth and cycling.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), non-protein coding transcripts, are widely known to play critical roles in differentiation and proliferation of stem cells.
Therefore, the current study aimed to explore the regulatory roles of lncRNA5322 in HFSCs proliferation and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.
Initially, the expression patterns of lncRNA5322 and microRNA-19b-3p (miR-19b-3p) in HFSCs were detected.
Subsequently, gain-and loss-of-functions analyses were conducted to explore the roles of lncRNA5322, miR-19b-3p and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) in cell proliferation, colony formation and apoptosis of HFSCs, with the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)1 and CDK2 examined.
Also, the interaction relationships among lncRNA5322, miR-19b-3p and MAPK1 were explored.
Furthermore, a mouse model was established to detect the roles of lncRNA5322, miR-19b-3p, and MAPK1 in wound contraction and epidermal regeneration.
Over-expressed lncRNA5322 was found to promote proliferation, colony formation ability but inhibit apoptosis of HFSCs, in addition to up-regulation of the expression of CDK1 and CDK2.
LncRNA5322 was found to act as a ceRNA of miR-19b-3p which directly targeted MAPK1.
Furthermore, up-regulation of lncRNA5322 enhanced wound contraction and epidermal regeneration in vivo by increasing the expression of MAPK1 through functioning as a ceRNA of miR-19b-3p.
In summary, the results in this study suggested that lncRNA5322 serves as a ceRNA of miR-19b-3p to elevate the expression of MAPK1, ultimately promoting HFSCs proliferation, wound contraction and epidermal regeneration of mouse model.

Induction of hair follicle neogenesis with cultured mouse dermal papilla cells in de novo regenerated skin tissues.
De novo skin regeneration with human keratinocytes amplified in culture is a life-saving procedure for patients with extensive skin loss and chronic wounds.
It also provides a valuable platform for gene function and therapeutic assessments.
Nevertheless, tissues generated in this manner lack hair follicles that are important for skin homeostasis, barrier function, and repair.
In this study, we generated skin tissues with human keratinocytes combined with dermal papilla (DP) cells isolated from mouse whisker hair.
For this, cultured keratinocytes and mouse DP (mDP) cells were mixed at 10:1 ratio and seeded onto devitalized human dermal matrix derived from surgically discarded human abdominoplasty skin.
After 1 week in submerged culture, the cell/matrix composites were grafted onto the skin wound beds of immunocompromised NSG.SCID mice.
Histological analysis of 6-week-old skin grafts showed that tissues generated with the addition of mDP cells contained Sox2-positive dermal condensates and well-differentiated folliculoid structures that express human keratinocyte markers.
These results indicate that cultured mDP cells can induce hair follicle neogenesis in the de novo regenerated skin tissues.
Our method offers a new experimental system for mechanistic studies of hair follicle morphogenesis and tissue regeneration and provides insights to solving an important clinical challenge in generation of fully functional skin with a limited source of donor cells.

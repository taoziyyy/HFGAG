# HFGAG
Construction of a Hair Follicle Growth Association Gene Dataset Using Text-Mining
Introduction
we designed a new literature mining-based extraction method for hair follicle growth associated key genes, in which all the challenges in the above were solved by proposing the HFNER-FCF model based on fusion contextual features to realize HF-NER and the HFGRE-MFM model based on the modified fine-tuning mechanism for hair follicle-gene relationship extraction to realize RE, respectively.

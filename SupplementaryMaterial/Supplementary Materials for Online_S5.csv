286,20071778,19353,F000013,1,"Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein modulates Wnt signaling and is required for hair follicle cycling in mice. The Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 are critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and are essential for skin and hair function. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family proteins act downstream of these GTPases, controlling actin assembly and cytoskeletal reorganization, but their role in epithelial cells has not been characterized in vivo. Here, we used a conditional knockout approach to assess the role of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), the ubiquitously expressed Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-like (WASL) protein, in mouse skin. We found that N-WASP deficiency in mouse skin led to severe alopecia, epidermal hyperproliferation, and ulceration, without obvious effects on epidermal differentiation and wound healing. Further analysis revealed that the observed alopecia was likely the result of a progressive and ultimately nearly complete block in hair follicle (HF) cycling by 5 months of age. N-WASP deficiency also led to abnormal proliferation of skin progenitor cells, resulting in their depletion over time. Furthermore, N-WASP deficiency in vitro and in vivo correlated with decreased GSK-3beta phosphorylation, decreased nuclear localization of beta-catenin in follicular keratinocytes, and decreased Wnt-dependent transcription. Our results indicate a critical role for N-WASP in skin function and HF cycling and identify a link between N-WASP and Wnt signaling. We therefore propose that N-WASP acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin-dependent transcription, modulating differentiation of HF progenitor cells.",hair Follicle cycling,Rac1,
653,18005048,5734,F000001,1,"Prostanoid receptors in anagen human hair follicles. Prostanoid pathway in hair follicle gained closer attention since trichogenic side-effects on hair growth has been observed concomitantly with prostaglandin F(2alpha) receptor (FP) agonist treatment of intraocular pressure. We thus investigated prostanoid receptor distribution in anagen hair follicle and different cell types from hair and skin. Using RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC), we found that all receptors were present in hair follicle. This data shed new light on an underestimated complex network involved in hair growth control. Indeed most of these receptors showed a wide spectrum of expression in cultured cells and the whole hair follicle. Using IHC, we observed that expression of prostaglandin E(2) receptors (EP(2), EP(3), EP(4)), prostaglandin D(2) receptor (DP(2)), prostanoid thromboxane A(2) receptor (TP) and to a lesser extent EP(1) involved several hair follicle compartments. On the opposite, Prostaglandin I(2) receptor (IP) and DP(1) were more specifically expressed in hair cuticle layer and outer root sheath (ORS) basal layer, respectively. FP expression was essentially restricted to ORS companion layer and dermal papilla (DP). Although extracting a clear functional significance from this intricate network remains open challenge, FP labelling, i.e. could explain the biological effect of PGF(2alpha) on hair regrowth, by directly modulating DP function.",hair Follicles,EP(4),1
257,31216464,2475,F000007,1,"Stimulation of Hair Growth by Small Molecules that Activate Autophagy. Hair plays important roles, ranging from the conservation of body heat to the preservation of psychological well-being. Hair loss or alopecia affects millions worldwide, but methods that can be used to regrow hair are lacking. We report that quiescent (telogen) hair follicles can be stimulated to initiate anagen and hair growth by small molecules that activate autophagy, including the metabolites alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) and alpha-ketobutyrate (alpha-KB), and the prescription drugs rapamycin and metformin, which impinge on mTOR and AMPK signaling. Stimulation of hair growth by these agents is blocked by specific autophagy inhibitors, suggesting a mechanistic link between autophagy and hair regeneration. Consistently, increased autophagy is detected upon anagen entry during the natural hair follicle cycle, and oral alpha-KB prevents hair loss in aged mice. Our finding that anagen can be pharmacologically activated in telogen skin when natural anagen-inducing signal(s) are absent has implications for the treatment of hair loss patients.",Hair loss,mTOR,1
336,25607935,1462,F000003,1,"Derivation of hair-inducing cell from human pluripotent stem cells. Dermal Papillae (DP) is a unique population of mesenchymal cells that was shown to regulate hair follicle formation and growth cycle. During development most DP cells are derived from mesoderm, however, functionally equivalent DP cells of cephalic hairs originate from Neural Crest (NC). Here we directed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to generate first NC cells and then hair-inducing DP-like cells in culture. We showed that hESC-derived DP-like cells (hESC-DPs) express markers typically found in adult human DP cells (e.g., p-75, nestin, versican, SMA, alkaline phosphatase) and are able to induce hair follicle formation when transplanted under the skin of immunodeficient NUDE mice. Engineered to express GFP, hESC-derived DP-like cells incorporate into DP of newly formed hair follicles and express appropriate markers. We demonstrated that BMP signaling is critical for hESC-DP derivation since BMP inhibitor dorsomorphin completely eliminated hair-inducing activity from hESC-DP cultures. DP cells were proposed as the cell-based treatment for hair loss diseases. Unfortunately human DP cells are not suitable for this purpose because they cannot be obtained in necessary amounts and rapidly loose their ability to induce hair follicle formation when cultured. In this context derivation of functional hESC-DP cells capable of inducing a robust hair growth for the first time shown here can become an important finding for the biomedical science.",hair growth,versican,1
318,35596731,1499,F000001,1,"Lagerstroemia indica extract regulates human hair dermal papilla cell growth and degeneration via modulation of beta-catenin, Stat6 and TGF-beta signaling pathway. BACKGROUND: Lagerstroemia indica (L. indica) is reported to have diverse biological activities including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, neuro-regulatory, antidiabetic and antioxidant activity. AIMS: The purpose of the present study is to examine the potential of hair growth promotion and/or hair loss prevention by L. indica extract. PATIENTS/METHODS: The effects of L. indica on hair growth have been studied in human hair follicle dermal papillary (hHFDP) cells and follicular organ culture ex vivo by cell proliferation assay, PCR, western blot analysis and reporter gene activity assay. Moreover, a clinical trial was conducted in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: L. indica significantly promoted the proliferation of hHFDP cells, which was associated with increased expression of TCF/LEF, VEGF and Gli1 mRNA, and inhibition of STAT6 and Smad2 mRNA. Treatment with L. indica also increased the TCF/LEF reporter gene activity but downregulated the SBE- and STAT6-luciferase activities. The expression of total beta-catenin, CDK4 and CDK2 were elevated, while that of STAT6 and SMAD2/3 was suppressed upon treatment with L. indica. In human hair follicles organ culture, L. indica significantly inhibited hair follicular degeneration. The clinical trial showed a statistically significant rise in total hair count in test group (n=24) after 24 weeks of applying the hair tonic enriched with L. indica (141.46 +- 21.27 number/cm2 , p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: We suggest that L. indica extract prevents hair loss as well as stimulate hair growth by regulating the Wnt-beta-catenin, JAK3-STAT6 and TGF-beta1-Smad signaling pathways, and may be further developed as a novel functional cosmetic for preventing hair loss.",hair Follicles,beta-catenin,1
211,31368409,470,F000001,1,"Use of extracellular matrix hydrogel from human placenta to restore hair-inductive potential of dermal papilla cells. Aim: To explore the feasibility of human placenta extracellular matrix (HPECM) hydrogel in restoring the hair-inductive capacity of high-passaged (P8) dermal papilla cells (DPCs) for hair follicle regeneration. Materials & methods: HPECM hydrogel was prepared following decellularization and enzymatic solubilization treatment. DPCs isolated from human scalp were cultured in 2D and 3D environments. The hair-inductive ability of DPCs was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining, immunoblotting and patch assay. Results: DPCs (P8) formed spheres when cultured on the HPECM hydrogel. The expression levels of Versican, ALP, and beta-catenin were restored in the DP spheres. HPECM hydrogel-cultured DP spheres co-grafted with newborn mouse epidermal cells regenerated new hair follicle. Conclusion: HPECM hydrogel successfully restores the hair-inductive capacity of high-passaged DPCs.",hair Follicle,ALP,1
622,15033191,581,F000003,1,"Effect of minoxidil on proliferation and apoptosis in dermal papilla cells of human hair follicle. BACKGROUND: Minoxidil has been widely used to treat androgenetic alopecia, but little is known about its pharmacological activity or about the identity of its target cells in hair follicles. We hypothesized that minoxidil has direct effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) of human hair follicle. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the mechanism of topical minoxidil action in terms of stimulating hair growth. METHODS: We evaluated cell proliferations in cultured DPCs by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and measured the expressions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt, Bcl-2, and Bax by Western blot. We also measured elongation of hair follicles in organ culture. RESULTS: Minoxidil significantly increased the proliferation of DPCs. The levels of ERK phosphorylation and of phosphorylated Akt increased significantly 1 h post-treatment; percentage increase of ERK phosphorylation was 287% at 0.1 microM and 351% at 1.0 microM of minoxidil, and that of Akt phosphorylation was 168% at 0.1 microM and 257% at 1.0 microM of minoxidil. 1.0 microM of minoxidil increased Bcl-2 expression over 150%, while 1.0 microM of minoxidil decreased Bax expression by more than 50%. Moreover, a significant elongation of individual hair follicles in organ culture was observed after adding minoxidil. CONCLUSION: Minoxidil promotes the survival of human DPCs by activating both ERK and Akt and by preventing cell death by increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. We suggest that minoxidil stimulates the growth of human hairs by prolonging anagen through these proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on DPCs.",hair growth,Bax,1
176,34604224,1499,F000036,1,"Transcriptome Analysis Reveals an Inhibitory Effect of Dihydrotestosterone-Treated 2D- and 3D-Cultured Dermal Papilla Cells on Hair Follicle Growth. Dermal papillae are a target of androgen action in patients with androgenic alopecia, where androgen acts on the epidermis of hair follicles in a paracrine manner. To mimic the complexity of the dermal papilla microenvironment, a better culture model of human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) is needed. Therefore, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated two-dimensional (2D)- and 3D-cultured DPCs on hair follicle growth. 2D- and 3D-cultured DPC proliferation was inhibited after co-culturing with outer root sheath (ORS) cells under DHT treatment. Moreover, gene expression levels of beta-catenin and neural cell adhesion molecules were significantly decreased and those of cleaved caspase-3 significantly increased in 2D- and 3D-cultured DPCs with increasing DHT concentrations. ORS cell proliferation also significantly increased after co-culturing in the control-3D model compared with the control-2D model. Ki67 downregulation and cleaved caspase-3 upregulation in DHT-treated 2D and 3D groups significantly inhibited ORS cell proliferation. Sequencing showed an increase in the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix synthesis in the 3D model group. Additionally, the top 10 hub genes were identified, and the expression of nine chemokine-related genes in DHT-treated DPCs was found to be significantly increased. We also identified the interactions between transcription factor (TF) genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) with hub genes and the TF-miRNA coregulatory network. Overall, the findings indicate that 3D-cultured DPCs are more representative of in vivo conditions than 2D-cultured DPCs and contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying androgen-induced alopecia.",ORS,beta-catenin,1

Functional hair follicle (HF) stem cells (SCs) are crucial to maintain the constant recurring growth of hair. In mice and humans, SC subpopulations with different biomarker expression profiles have been identified in discrete anatomic compartments of the HF. The rare studies investigating canine HF SCs have shown similarities in biomarker expression profiles to that of mouse and human SCs. The aim of our study was to broaden the current repertoire of SC-associated markers and their expression patterns in the dog. We combined analyses on the expression levels of CD34, K15, Sox9, CD200, Nestin, LGR5 and LGR6 in canine skin using RT-qPCR, the corresponding proteins in dog skin lysates, and their expression patterns in canine HFs using immunohistochemistry. Using validated antibodies, we were able to define the location of CD34, Sox9, Keratin15, LGR5 and Nestin in canine HFs and confirm that all tested biomarkers are expressed in canine skin. Our results show similarities between the expression profile of canine, human and mouse HF SC markers. This repertoire of biomarkers will allow us to conduct functional studies and investigate alterations in the canine SC compartment of different diseases, like alopecia or skin cancer with the possibility to extend relevant findings to human patients.",hair Follicle (HF) stem cells,LGR6,
256,30991711,7422,F000001,1,"Kojyl Cinnamate Ester Derivatives Increase Adiponectin Expression and Stimulate Adiponectin-Induced Hair Growth Factors in Human Dermal Papilla Cells. Adiponectin (APN), released mainly from adipose tissue, is a well-known homeostatic factor for regulating glucose levels, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity. A recent study showed that human hair follicles express APN receptors and the presence of APN-mediated hair growth signaling, thereby suggesting that APN is a potent hair growth-promoting adipokine. Previously, kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives (KCEDs) were synthesized in our institute as new anti-aging or adiponectin-/adipogenesis-inducing compounds. Here, we tested the activity of these derivatives to induce endogenous APN secretion. Among the derivatives, KCED-1 and KCED-2 showed improved activity in inducing APN mRNA expression, secretion of APN protein, and adipogenesis in human subcutaneous fat cells (hSCFs) when compared with the effects of Seletinoid G, a verified APN inducer. When human follicular dermal papilla cells were treated with the culture supernatant of KCED-1- or KCED-2-treated hSCFs, the mRNA expression of APN-induced hair growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor was upregulated compared with that in the control. Taken together, our study shows that among kojyl cinnamate ester derivatives, KCED-1, KCED-2, as well as Seletinoid G are effective inducers of endogenous APN production in subcutaneous fat tissues, which may in turn contribute to the promotion of hair growth in the human scalp.",hair Follicles,vascular endothelial growth factor,1

Systematic ablation of previously identified dermal papilla (DP) signature genes in embryonic DP precursors will reveal their functional roles during hair follicle morphogenesis. In this study, we validate Enpp2/Autotaxin as one of the highest expressed signature genes in postnatal DP, and demonstrate specific expression of this lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-generating enzyme in embryonic dermal condensates. We further identify dermal and epidermal expression of several LPA receptors, suggesting that LPA signaling could contribute to follicle morphogenesis in both mesenchymal and epithelial compartments. We then use the recently characterized Cre-expressing Tbx18 knock-in line to conditionally ablate Enpp2 in embryonic DP precursors. Despite efficient gene knockout in embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) dermal condensates, morphogenesis proceeds regularly with normal numbers, lengths, and sizes of all hair follicle types, suggesting that Enpp2 is not required for hair follicle formation. To interrogate DP signature gene expression, we finally isolate control and Enpp2-null DP precursors and identify the expression and upregulation of LIPH, an alternative LPA-producing enzyme, suggesting that this gene could functionally compensate for the absence of Enpp2. We conclude that future coablation of both LPA-producing enzymes or of several LPA receptors may reveal the functional role of LPA signaling during hair follicle morphogenesis.",hair Follicle morphogenesis,LIPH

Hair follicles (HFs) are regenerative miniorgans that offer a highly informative model system to study the regulatory mechanisms of hair follicle stem cells (hfSCs) homeostasis and differentiation. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is key in both of these processes, governing hfSCs quiescence in the bulge and differentiation of matrix progenitors. However, whether canonical or noncanonical pathways of BMP signaling are responsible for these processes remains unresolved. Here, we conditionally ablated two canonical effectors of BMP signaling, Smad1 and Smad5 during hair morphogenesis and postnatal cycling in mouse skin. Deletion of Smad1 and Smad5 (dKO) in the epidermis during morphogenesis resulted in neonatal lethality with lack of visible whiskers. Interestingly, distinct patterns of phospho-Smads (pSmads) activation were detected with pSmad8 restricted to epidermis and pSmad1 and pSmad5 exclusively activated in HFs. Engraftment of dKO skin revealed retarded hair morphogenesis and failure to differentiate into visible hair. The formation of the prebulge and bulge reservoir for quiescent hfSCs was precluded in dKO HFs which remained in prolonged anagen. Surprisingly, in postnatal telogen HFs, pSmad8 expression was no longer limited to epidermis and was also present in dKO bulge hfSCs and matrix progenitors. Although pSmad8 activity alone could not prevent dKO hfSCs precocious anagen activation, it sustained efficient postnatal differentiation and regeneration of visible hairs. Together, our data suggest a pivotal role for canonical BMP signaling demonstrating distinguished nonoverlapping function of pSmad8 with pSmad1 and pSmad5 in hfSCs regulation and hair morphogenesis but a redundant role in adult hair progenitors differentiation.",hair Follicle stem cells,Smad1

We have previously reported that hair follicles contain multipotent stem cells, which express nestin and participate in follicle growth at anagen as well as in the extension of the follicle sensory nerve. The nestin-driven green fluorescent protein (ND-GFP) transgenic mouse labels all nestin-expressing cells with GFP. The hair follicle nestin-GFP cells can differentiate into neurons, Schwann cells, and other cell types. In this study, we describe nestin-expressing multipotent stem cells in the fungiform papilla in the tongue. The nestin-expressing multipotent stem cells in the fungiform papilla are located around a peripheral sensory nerve immediately below the taste bud and co-express the neural crest cell marker p75(NTR) . The fungiform papilla cells formed spheres in suspension culture in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The spheres consisted of nestin-expressing cells that co-expressed the neural crest marker p75(NTR) and which developed expression of the stem cell marker CD34. P75(NTR), CD34 and nestin co-expression suggested that nestin-expressing cells comprising the fungiform papilla spheres were in a relatively undifferentiated state. The nestin-expressing cells of these spheres acquired the following markers: beta III tubulin typical of nerve cells; GFAP typical of glial cells; K15 typical of keratinocytes; and smooth-muscle antigen (SMA), after transfer to RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), suggesting they differentiated into multiple cell types. The results of the current study indicate nestin-expressing fungiform papilla cells and the nestin-expressing hair follicle stem cells have common features of cell morphology and ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, suggesting their remarkable similarity.",Follicle growth,GFAP

The hair follicle (HF) is an exceptional mini-organ to study the mechanisms which regulate HF morphogenesis, cycling, hair follicle stem cell (hfSCs) homeostasis, and progeny differentiation. During morphogenesis, Wnt signaling is well-characterized in the initiation of HF patterning but less is known about which particular Wnt ligands are required and whether individual Wnt ligands act in an indispensable or redundant manner during postnatal hfSCs anagen onset and HF cycle progression. Previously, we described the function of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling target gene WNT7a in intrinsic regulation of hfSCs homeostasis in vivo. Here, we investigated the role of Wnt7b, which was also intrinsically upregulated in hfSCs during physiological and precocious anagen after BMP inhibition in vivo. We demonstrated Wnt7b to be a direct target of canonical BMP signaling in hfSCs and using Wnt7b conditional gene targeting during HF morphogenesis revealed disrupted HF cycling including a shorter anagen, premature catagen onset with overall shorter hair production, and diminished HF differentiation marker expression. Additionally, we observed that postnatal ablation of Wnt7b resulted in delayed HF activation, affecting both the hair germ and bulge hfSCs but still maintaining a two-step sequence of HF stimulation. Interestingly, Wnt7b cKO hfSCs participated in reformation of the new HF bulge, but with slower self-renewal. These findings demonstrate the importance of intrinsic Wnt7b expression in hfSCs regulation and normal HF cycling and surprisingly reveal a nonredundant role for Wnt7b in the control of HF anagen length and catagen entry which was not compensated by other Wnt ligands.",hair Follicle cycling.,WNT7a

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the dynamic expression of Wnt family member 5A (Wingless-type MMTV integration Wnt site family, member 5a) in murine hair cycle and its inhibitory effects on follicle in vivo. METHODS: Situ hybridization in full-thickness skin was used to observe the change of mouse protein expression in different growth stages, and Ad-Wnt5a was injected after defeathering to observe the hair follicle growth in vivo. RESULTS: The Wnt5a mRNA was expressed at birth, and was firstly increased then decreased along with the progress of the hair cycle. It reached the peak in advanced stage of growth cycle (P<0.05). Rhoa and beta-catenin expression levels were significantly decreased in three groups. Rac2 expression was significantly up-regulated, and the expression level of Wnt5a, Shh and Frizzled2 was increased, but less significantly than group 2. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Wnt5a mRNA is consistent with change of murine follicle cycle, and has obvious inhibitory effects on the growth of hair follicle in vivo, indicating that it is antagonistic to Wnts pathway and interferes the growth of follicle together.",hair Follicle growth,beta-catenin

Decorin is a prototypical member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) family, which is involved in numerous biological processes. The role of decorin, as a representative SLRP, in hair follicle morphogenesis has not been elucidated. We present our initial findings on decorin expression patterns during induced murine hair follicle (HF) cycles. It was found that decorin expression is exclusively restricted to the epidermis, outer root sheath and sebaceous glands during the anagen phase, which correlates with the upregulation of decorin mRNA and protein expression in depilated murine dorsal skin. Furthermore, we used a functional approach to investigate the effects of recombinant human decorin (rhDecorin) via cutaneous injection into HFs at various murine hair cycle stages. The local injection of rhDecorin (100 mug/ml) into the hypodermis of depilated C57BL/6 mice at anagen delayed catagen progression. In contrast, rhDecorin injection during the telogen phase caused the premature onset of anagen, as demonstrated by the assessment of the following parameters: (i) hair shaft length, (ii) follicular bulbar diameter, (iii) hair follicle cycling score and (iv) follicular phase percentage. Taken together, our results suggest that decorin may modulate follicular cycling and morphogenesis.

The use of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in cell therapies has increased the demand for strategies that allow efficient cell scale-up.

We exploited a rich source of autologous stem cells (human hair follicle) and demonstrated the robust in vitro long-term expansion of human hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hHF-MSCs) by using CultiSpher( )-G microcarriers. We analyzed the feasibility of 3D culture by using hHF-MSCs/CultiSpher( )-G microcarrier constructs for its potential applicability in regenerative medicine by comparatively analyzing the performance of hHF-MSCs adhered to the CultiSpher( )-G microspheres in 3D spinner culture and those grown on the gelatin-coated plastic dishes (2D culture), using various assays. We showed that the hHF-MSCs seeded at various densities quickly adhered to and proliferated well on the microspheres, thus generating at least hundreds of millions of hHF-MSCs on 1 g of CultiSpher( )-G within 12 days. This resulted in a cumulative cell expansion of greater than 26-fold. Notably, the maximum and average proliferation rates in 3D culture were significantly greater than that of the 2D culture. However, the hHF-MSCs from both the cultures retained surface marker and nestin expression, proliferation capacity and differentiation potentials toward adipocytes, osteoblasts and smooth muscle cells and showed no significant differences as evidenced by Edu incorporation, cell cycle, colony formation, apoptosis, biochemical quantification and qPCR assays.",hair Follicle-derived,nestin

We discovered specific structures, identified as invalid placodes, positive for ectodysplasin A1 receptor, nuclear beta-catenin, and LEF1, which failed to invaginate, produced a double basal-like layer of epidermal cells, and lacked cylindrical keratinocytes. Specification of dermal papillae (DP) was impaired, and the papillary dermis expressed alkaline phosphatase and LEF1. We also detected DP-like groups of intensively stained cells in the absence of visible signs of folliculogenesis in the epidermis.

Observations in thyroid patients and experimental animals show that the skin is an important target for the thyroid hormones. We previously showed that deletion in mice of the thyroid hormone nuclear receptors TRalpha1 and TRbeta (the main thyroid hormone-binding isoforms) results in impaired epidermal proliferation, hair growth, and wound healing. Stem cells located at the bulges of the hair follicles are responsible for hair cycling and contribute to the regeneration of the new epidermis after wounding. Therefore a reduction in the number or function of the bulge stem cells could be responsible for this phenotype. Bulge cells show increased levels of epigenetic repressive marks, can retain bromodeoxyuridine labeling for a long time, and have colony-forming efficiency (CFE) in vitro. Here we demonstrate that mice lacking TRs do not have a decrease of the bulge stem cell population. Instead, they show an increase of label-retaining cells (LRCs) in the bulges and enhanced CFE in vitro. Reduced activation of stem cells leading to their accumulation in the bulges is indicated by a strongly reduced response to mobilization by 12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate. Altered function of the bulge stem cells is associated with aberrant activation of Smad signaling, leading to reduced nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, which is crucial for stem cell proliferation and mobilization.

BACKGROUND: The fleece of cashmere goats contains two distinct populations of fibers, a short and fine non-medullated insulating cashmere fiber and a long and coarse medullated guard hair. The former is produced by secondary follicles (SFs) and the later by primary follicles (PFs). Evidence suggests that the induction of PFs and SFs may require different signaling pathways. The regulation of BMP2/4 signaling by noggin and Edar signaling via Downless genes are essential for the induction of SFs and PFs, respectively. However, these differently expressed genes of the signaling pathway cannot directly distinguish between the PFs and SFs. RESULTS: In this study, we selected RNA samples from 11 PFs and 7 SFs that included 145,525 exons. The pathway analysis of 4512 differentially expressed exons revealed that the most statistically significant metabolic pathway was related to the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway (UMPP) (P<3.32x 10-7). In addition, the 51 exons of the UMPP that were differentially expressed between the different types of hair follicle (HFs) were compared by cluster analysis. This resulted in the PFs and SFs being divided into two classes. The expression level of two selected exons was analyzed by qRT-PCR, and the results indicated that the expression patterns were consistent with the deep sequencing results obtained by RNA-Seq. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the comparative transcriptome analysis of 18 HFs from cashmere goats, a large number of differentially expressed exons were identified using a high-throughput sequencing approach. This study suggests that UMPP activation is a prominent signaling pathway for distinguishing the PFs and SFs of cashmere goats. It is also a meaningful contribution to the theoretical basis of the biological study of the HFs of cashmere goats and other mammals.",secondary Follicles,BMP2/4

In the present study, we aimed at elucidating the genetic basis of a new form of ED featuring facial dysmorphism, scalp hypotrichosis and hypodontia. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified 2 frameshift and 2 missense mutations in TSPEAR segregating with the disease phenotype in 3 families. TSPEAR encodes the thrombospondin-type laminin G domain and EAR repeats (TSPEAR) protein, whose function is poorly understood. TSPEAR knock-down resulted in altered expression of genes known to be regulated by NOTCH and to be involved in murine hair and tooth development. Pathway analysis confirmed that down-regulation of TSPEAR in keratinocytes is likely to affect Notch signaling. Accordingly, using a luciferase-based reporter assay, we showed that TSPEAR knock-down is associated with decreased Notch signaling. In addition, NOTCH1 protein expression was reduced in patient scalp skin. Moreover, TSPEAR silencing in mouse hair follicle organ cultures was found to induce apoptosis in follicular epithelial cells, resulting in decreased hair bulb diameter.

Our previous study indicated that factors secreted from early-passage DPCs contribute to hair follicle (HF) regeneration. To identify which factors are responsible for HF regeneration and why late-passage DPCs lose this potential, we collected 48-h-culture medium (CM) from both of passage 3 and 9 DPCs, and subcutaneously injected the DPC-CM into NU/NU mice.

Low level laser therapy is widely used to relieve pain and inflammation, and to restore cellular functions. The photons of light are absorbed by mitochondria in cells, leading to an increase in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nitric oxide release, blood flow, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study proposed the use of a laser diode array at 808 nm to stimulate the proliferation and to activate the functions of dermal papilla cells, which were an important part of the hair growth cycle. These cells were isolated from human hair follicles and were exposed to 808 nm light at various doses from 0.5, 1, 2.5, 4, and 6 J/cm2. The rate of cell proliferation and the gene expression profile of dermal papilla cells were investigated and compared with the control in which the cells did not received any light treatment. The growth curves of the dermal papilla cells were used to determine the specific growth rates. Higher specific growth rates were observed in the cells exposed to laser at doses higher than 0.5 J/cm2. The effect of the laser light treatment on several gene markers, specifically for dermal papilla cells, was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Our result shows that collagen type 1 (Col1), alkaline phosphatase (Alp), and versican (Vcan) did not increase when the cells were irradiated by the laser light. Interestingly, sex determining region y-box 2 (Sox2) gene was up-regulated when 0.5 J/cm2, and 1 J/cm2 light was used, while an increase in the level of fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) gene was observed with light irradiation at 0.5 J/cm2, 1 J/cm2, 2.5 J/cm2, and 4 J/cm2.

Mesenchymal niche cells instruct activity of tissue-resident stem and progenitor cell populations. Epithelial stem cells in hair follicles (HFs) have region-specific activity, which may arise from intrinsic cellular heterogeneity within mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP) cells. Here we show that expression of Hoxc genes is sufficient to reprogram mesenchymal DP cells and alter the regenerative potential of epithelial stem cells. Hoxc gene expression in adult skin dermis closely correlates with regional HF regeneration patterns. Disrupting the region-specific expression patterns of Hoxc genes, by either decreasing their epigenetic repression via Bmi1 loss or inducing ectopic interactions of the Hoxc locus with an active epigenetic region, leads to precocious HF regeneration. We further show that a single Hoxc gene is sufficient to activate dormant DP niches and promote regional HF regeneration through canonical Wnt signaling. Altogether, these results reveal that Hoxc genes bestow mesenchymal niches with tissue-level heterogeneity and plasticity.",dermal papilla,Hoxc

Mammalian wounds typically heal by fibrotic repair without hair follicle (HF) regeneration. Fibrosis and regeneration are currently considered the opposite end of wound healing. This study sought to determine if scar could be remodeled to promote healing with HF regeneration. Here, we identify that activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway reinstalls a regenerative dermal niche, called dermal papilla, which is required and sufficient for HF neogenesis (HFN). Epidermal Shh overexpression or constitutive Smoothened dermal activation results in extensive HFN in wounds that otherwise end in scarring. While long-term Wnt activation is associated with fibrosis, Shh signal activation in Wnt active cells promotes the dermal papilla fate in scarring wounds. These studies demonstrate that mechanisms of scarring and regeneration are not distant from one another and that wound repair can be redirected to promote regeneration following injury by modifying a key dermal signal.",hair Follicle (HF) regeneration,Sonic hedgehog

Liver cirrhosis (LC) involves multiple systems throughout the body, and patients with LC often die of multiple organ failure. However, few drugs are useful to treat LC. Hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells (HF-MSCs) are derived from the dermal papilla and the bulge area of hair follicles and are pluripotent stem cells in the mesoderm with broad prospects in regenerative medicine. As an emerging seed cell type widely used in skin wound healing and plastic surgery, HF-MSCs show considerable prospects in the treatment of LC due to their proliferation and multidirectional differentiation capabilities. We established an LC model in C57BL/6J mice by administering carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and injected HF-MSCs through the tail vein to explore the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of HF-MSCs on LC. Here, we found that HF-MSCs improved liver function and ameliorated the liver pathology of LC. Notably, PKH67-labeled HF-MSCs were detected in the injured liver and expressed the hepatocyte-specific markers cytokeratin 18 (CK18) and albumin (ALB). In addition, in contrast to that in the LC group, the alpha-SMA expression showed a decreasing trend in the treatment group in vitro and in vivo, indicating that the pathological activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) was inhibited by HF-MSC treatment. Moreover, the levels of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) and p-Smad3, a signaling molecule downstream of TGF-beta1, were increased in mice with LC, while HF-MSC treatment reversed these changes in vivo and in vitro. Based on these findings, HF-MSCs may reverse LC by blocking the TGF-beta/Smad pathway and inhibiting the pathological activation of HSCs, which may provide evidence for the application of HF-MSCs to treat LC.",dermal papilla,TGF-beta1

Various traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) have been used clinically for treating alopecia, however, the effective compounds and underlying mechanism are less known. We sought to investigate the effect of Alpinetin (AP), a compound extracted from Fabaceae and Zingiberaceae herbs, in hair regeneration. METHODS: Animal model for hair regeneration was mimicked by depilation in C57BL/6J mice. The mice were then topically treated with 3 mg/ml AP, minoxidil as positive control (PC), or solvent ethanol as vehicle control (VC) on the dorsal skin. Skin color changes which reflected the hair growth stages were monitored and pictured, along with H&E staining and hair shaft length measurement. RNA-seq analysis combined with immunofluorescence staining and qPCR analysis were used for mechanism study. Meanwhile, Gli1CreERT2; R26RtdTomato and Lgr5EGFP-CreERT2; R26RtdTomato transgenic mice were used to monitor the activation and proliferation of Gli1+ and Lgr5+ HFSCs after treatment. Furthermore, the toxicity of AP was tested in keratinocytes and fibroblasts from both human and mouse skin to assess the safety. RESULTS: When compared to minoxidil-treated and vehicle-treated control mice, topical application of AP promoted anagen initiation and delayed catagen entry, resulting in a longer anagen phase and hair shaft length. Mechanistically, RNA-seq analysis combined with immunofluorescence staining of Lef1 suggested that Lgr5+ HFSCs in lower bulge were activated by AP via Wnt signaling. Other HFSCs, including K15+, Lef1+, and Gli1+ cells, were also promoted into proliferating upon AP treatment. In addition, AP inhibited cleaved caspase 3-dependent apoptosis at the late anagen stage to postpone regression of hair follicles.

BACKGROUND: The hair-follicle bulge has recently been added to a growing list of human tissue compartments that exhibit a complex combination of immunosuppressive mechanisms, termed immune privilege (IP), which seem to restrict immune-mediated injury in specific locations. As epithelial hair-follicle stem cells (eHFSC) reside in the hair-follicle bulge region, it is conceivable that these IP mechanisms protect this vital compartment from immune-mediated damage, thereby ensuring the ongoing growth and cyclic regeneration of the hair follicle. Primary cicatricial alopecias (PCA) are a group of inflammatory hair disorders that result in hair-follicle destruction and permanent alopecia. Growing evidence suggests that eHFSC destruction is a key factor in the permanent follicle loss seen in these conditions. AIM: To explore the possible role of bulge IP collapse in PCA pathogenesis. METHODS: We report three clinically distinct cases of PCA. Immunohistochemical analyses of paired biopsies from lesional and uninvolved scalp skin were compared using recognized markers of IP.

We compared the expression of those genes in mice with a nonsense mutation in hairless (Rhino), which have a similar alopecia phenotype, and to Cyp27b1 null mice which are deficient in the production of 1,25(OH)2D3, the Vdr ligand, but display normal hair follicle cycling. Our results demonstrate the down regulation of hair follicle markers and the alteration of expression of hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, Fgf, and Tgfbeta pathways in VdrKO and Rhino mice, but not in Cyp27b1KO mice. Treatment of VdrKO mice with an agonist to the Hh pathway partially restored hair follicle cycling, suggesting a role of this pathway in the regulation of hair follicle cycling by VDR.

We have previously shown that hair follicle stem cells can regenerate peripheral nerve and spinal cord. In the present study, we describe the embryonic development of the hair follicle stem cell area (hfPSCA), which is located above the bulge and below the sebaceous glands in the adult mouse. At embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) of nestindriven GFP (ND-GFP) transgenic mice, which express nestin in hfPS cells, the ND-GFP hair follicle stem cells are located in mesenchymal condensates. At postnatal day 0 (P0), the ND-GFP-expressing cells are migrating to the upper part of the hair follicle from the dermal papilla. At P3, keratin 15 (K15)-positive cells, derived from ND-GFP dermal papilla cells, are located in the outer-root sheath and basal layer of the epidermis. By P10, the ND-GFP have formed the K15-positive outer-root sheath as well as the ND-GFP hfPSA.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA), also known as common baldness, is characterized by a marked decrease in hair follicle size, which could be related to the loss of hair follicle stem or progenitor cells. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed bald and non-bald scalp from AGA individuals for the presence of hair follicle stem and progenitor cells. Cells expressing cytokeratin15 (KRT15), CD200, CD34, and integrin, alpha6 (ITGA6) were quantitated via flow cytometry. High levels of KRT15 expression correlated with stem cell properties of small cell size and quiescence. These KRT15(hi) stem cells were maintained in bald scalp samples. However, CD200(hi)ITGA6(hi) and CD34(hi) cell populations--which both possessed a progenitor phenotype, in that they localized closely to the stem cell-rich bulge area but were larger and more proliferative than the KRT15(hi) stem cells--were markedly diminished. In functional assays, analogous CD200(hi)Itga6(hi) cells from murine hair follicles were multipotent and generated new hair follicles in skin reconstitution assays. These findings support the notion that a defect in conversion of hair follicle stem cells to progenitor cells plays a role in the pathogenesis of AGA.",hair Follicle,ITGA6

OBJECTIVE: Here, we assessed the ability of CSLM to evaluate the formation of neogenic hair follicles after a full-thickness wound in mice. METHODS: Full-thickness wounds were made on the dorsal skin of 3-week-old mice. After scab detachment (SD), the number, width, length, space and volume of neogenic hair follicles were analyzed using CSLM. The results were compared with those from conventional methods, including staining for alkaline phosphatase (AP) and keratin 17 (K17) as well as histology. RESULTS: Quantification of neogenic hair follicles using CSLM compared favorably with the results from direct measurements on isolated epidermal tissue after immunostaining for K17, a marker for the epithelial portion of new hair follicles. CSLM detected 89% of K17-stained follicles. CSLM more accurately quantified the number of new follicles compared with AP staining, which detects the dermal portion of the new follicle. The width and length measurement from CSLM and histology were very close and correlated with each other. The minimum length of a neogenic hair follicle that could be detected by CSLM was 21 mum. The space between neogenic hair follicles was decreased in histological sections compared with CSLM. CONCLUSION: CSLM is an accurate and valuable method for counting and measuring neogenic hair follicles non-invasively. CSLM produces images similar to histology in mice. Measurements of microstructures using CSLM more accurately reflect actual sizes as this technique avoids fixation artifacts. In vivo visualization of developing follicles with CSLM allows the detection of serial changes in hair follicle formation, thus conserving the numbers of mice required for studies and improving the detection of temporal changes in developing hair follicles.",hair Follicles,keratin 17

OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanisms of hair follicle regeneration by injection of follicular cells isolated from murine skin. METHODS: Epidermis was peeled off from the dermis of 3-5 d C57BL/6J mouse by 0.2% Dispase digestion at 37 degrees C for 2 hours. Dermis was cut into small pieces and digested in 0.2% collagenase at 37 degrees C for 30 minute with low speed stirring to isolate hair follicles from dermis. Hair follicles were collected through filtration, low-speed centrifugation and density gradient centrifugation. Collagenase and trypsin were added to digest hair follicles into dissociated cells which were marked by Dio and injected into the nude mouse skin. RESULTS: 2 d after intradermal injection of hair follicle cells, a cyst was formed containing lots of round and elliptical cells and homogeneous eosin stained cell-free tissues. The cyst wall was composed of many spindle shaped fibroblast cells and showed sparsely localized green fluorescence. The contents of the cyst showed bright green fluorescence. 4 d after injection, the skin became slightly thicken with grey appearance, a lots of hair follicles formed with black bulb. 1 weeks after injection, the injection site became black and evaluated with a lots of black hair follicles and hyperproliferation of capillary blood. Newly formed hair follicles showed bright green fluorescence. 3 weeks after injection, a cyst containing lots of black hairs formed in the injection site. Newly formed hair follicles showed positive for Dio. Sebaceous gland can be seen accompanied with hair follicles. 6 weeks after injection, the cyst contained lots of sheded club hair shafts and hair follicles on the stage of anagen. Cultured follicular cells and injection below 1 x 10(5) failed to regenerate hairs. While the regenerated hair follicle was few when the hair follicle cells were injected subcutaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Follicular cells can aggregate spontaneously and develop synergistically into hair follicles with normal growth cycle after implantation. The regeneration depends on the interactions between follicular cells, as well as on the recipient sites and cell numbers.",Hair Follicle regeneration,bulb. 1

To gain insight into the functional role of Trps1, we analyzed the late morphogenesis vibrissae phenotype of Trps1(Deltagt) mutant mice, which is characterized by follicle degeneration after peg downgrowth has been initiated. We found that Trps1 directly represses expression of the hair follicle stem cell regulator Sox9 to control proliferation of the follicle epithelium. Furthermore, we identified a copy number variation upstream of SOX9 in a family with hypertrichosis that significantly decreases expression of the gene in the hair follicle, providing new insights into the long-range regulation of SOX9.

Prostaglandins (PGs) are key inflammatory mediators involved in wound healing and regulating hair growth; however, their role in skin regeneration after injury is unknown. Using wound-induced hair follicle neogenesis (WIHN) as a marker of skin regeneration, we hypothesized that PGD2 decreases follicle neogenesis. PGE2 and PGD2 were elevated early and late, respectively, during wound healing. The levels of WIHN, lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (Ptgds), and its product PGD2 each varied significantly among background strains of mice after wounding, and all correlated such that the highest Ptgds and PGD2 levels were associated with the lowest amount of regeneration. In addition, an alternatively spliced transcript variant of Ptgds missing exon 3 correlated with high regeneration in mice. Exogenous application of PGD2 decreased WIHN in wild-type mice, and PGD2 receptor Gpr44-null mice showed increased WIHN compared with strain-matched control mice. Furthermore, Gpr44-null mice were resistant to PGD2-induced inhibition of follicle neogenesis. In all, these findings demonstrate that PGD2 inhibits hair follicle regeneration through the Gpr44 receptor and imply that inhibition of PGD2 production or Gpr44 signaling will promote skin regeneration.",skin regeneration,Ptgds

BACKGROUND AIMS: Little is published on the characterization and therapeutic potential of human mesenchymal cells derived from hair follicle (HF) dermal sheath (DS). In this study, we isolated and characterized HF DS-mesenchymal stromal cells (DS-MSCs) with respect to the bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs). We further tested if DS-MSC-conditioned medium (CM), like what was previously reported for BM-MSC CM, has superior wound-healing properties, in both in vitro and in vivo wound models compared with skin fibroblast CM. METHODS: DS-MSCs were isolated from HF and cultured in vitro to assess long-term growth potential, colony-forming efficiency (CFE), expression of CD surface markers and differentiation potential. The cytokine expression of DS-MSC CM was determined through an antibody-based protein array analysis. The wound-healing effects of the CM were tested in vitro with the use of human cell cultures and in vivo with the use of a diabetic mouse wound model. RESULTS: In vitro results revealed that DS-MSCs have high growth capacity and CFE while displaying some phenotypes similar to BM-MSCs. DS-MSCs strongly expressed many surface markers expressed in BM-MSCs and could also differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes. DS-MSCs secreted significantly higher proportions of paracrine factors such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and growth-related oncogene. DS-MSC-CM demonstrated enhanced wound-healing effects on human skin keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in vitro, and the wound-healing time in diabetic mice was found to be shorter, compared with vehicle controls. CONCLUSIONS: Human HF DS stromal cells demonstrated MSC-like properties and might be an alternative source for therapeutic use in wound healing.",DS,IL-8

This process is likely coordinated by a variety of mechanisms including apoptosis and loss of growth factor signaling. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying follicle involution after hair keratinocyte differentiation and hair shaft assembly remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that a highly conserved microRNA, miR-22 is markedly upregulated during catagen and peaks in telogen. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches in vivo, we find that miR-22 overexpression leads to hair loss by promoting anagen-to-catagen transition of the HF, and that deletion of miR-22 delays entry to catagen and accelerates the transition from telogen to anagen. Ectopic activation of miR-22 results in hair loss due to the repression a hair keratinocyte differentiation program and keratinocyte progenitor expansion, as well as promotion of apoptosis.

To examine the role of this complex in the epidermis, we generated mutant mice harboring epidermal-specific deletion of aPKClambda (conditional knock-out (cKO)), a major component of the aPKC-PAR complex. The mutant mice exhibited abnormal hair follicle (HF) cycling, progressive losses of pelage hairs and vibrissae, and altered differentiation into the epidermis and sebaceous gland. We found that in the aPKClambda cKO mice HF stem cell (HFSC) quiescence was lost, as revealed by the decreased expression level of quiescence-inducing factors (Fgf18 and Bmp6) produced in Keratin 6-positive bulge stem cells. The loss of quiescence dysregulated the HFSC marker expression and led to the increase in Lrig1-positive cells, inducing hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous glands, and drove an increase in Lef1-positive matrix cells, causing a prolonged anagen-like phase. Persistent bulge stem cell activation led to a gradual depletion of CD34- and alpha6 integrin-positive HFSC reservoirs.

61,34026290,650,F000008,1,"Rescuing key native traits in cultured dermal papilla cells for human hair regeneration. Introduction: The dermal papilla (DP) represents the major regulatory entity within the hair follicle (HF), inducing hair formation and growth through reciprocal interactions with epithelial cells. However, human DP cells rapidly lose their hair inductive ability when cultured in an epithelium-deficient environment. Objectives: To determine if the conditioned medium collected from interfollicular keratinocytes (KCs-CM) is capable of improving DP cell native properties and inductive phenotype. Methods: DP cells were cultured with KCs-CM both in 2D and 3D culture conditions (spheroids). Further, the hair-inductive capacity of DP cells precultured with KCs-CM was tested in a hair reconstitution assay, after co-grafting with human keratinocytes in nude mice. Results: We demonstrate that KCs-CM contributes to restore the inductivity of cultured human DP cells in a more effective mode than the conventional 3D-cultures. This is supported by the higher active alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in DP cells, the improved self-aggregative capacity and the reduced expression of alpha-SMA and the V1-isoform of versican. Moreover, DP cells cultured with KCs-CM displayed a secretome profile (VEGF, BMP2, TGF- beta1, IL-6) that matches the one observed during anagen. KCs-CM also enhanced DP cell proliferation, while preventing cells to undergo morphological changes characteristic of high passage cells. In opposition, the amount of collagenous and non-collagenous proteins deposited by DP cells was lower in the presence of KCs-CM. The improvement in ALP activity was maintained in 3D spheroidal cultures, even after KCs-CM retrieval, being superior to the effect of the gold-standard culture conditions. Moreover, DP cells cultured with KCs-CM and grafted with human keratinocytes supported the formation of HF- and sebaceous gland-like structures in mice. Conclusion: The proposed strategy encourages future cell-based strategies for HF regeneration not only in the context of hair-associated disorders, but also in the management of wounds to aid in restoring critical skin regulatory appendages.",hair regeneration,BMP2

In this study, we attempted to reproduce the anatomical relationship between an epithelial main body and the dermal papilla (DP) within HF in vitro by three-dimensionally assembling columnarly molded human keratinocytes (KCs) and the aggregates of DP cells and evaluated how HF characteristics were reproduced in the constructs. The replaceability of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived DP substitutes was assessed using the aforementioned reconstruction assay. Human DP cell aggregates were embedded into Matrigel as a cluster. Subsequently, highly condensed human KCs were cylindrically injected onto DP spheroids. After 2-week culture, the structures visually mimicking HFs were obtained. KC-DP constructs partially reproduced HF microanatomy and demonstrated differential keratin (KRT) expression pattern in HFs: KRT14 in the outermost part and KRT13, KRT17, and KRT40, respectively, in the inner portion of the main body. KC-DP constructs tended to upregulate HF-related genes, KRT25, KRT33A, KRT82, WNT5A, and LEF1. Next, DP substitutes were prepared by exposing hiPSC-derived mesenchymal cells to retinoic acid and subsequently to WNT, BMP, and FGF signal activators, followed by cell aggregation. The resultant hiPSC-derived DP substitutes (iDPs) were combined with KCs in the invented assay. KC-iDP constructs morphologically resemble KC-DP constructs and analogously mimicked KRT expression pattern in HF. iDP in the constructs expressed DP-related markers, such as vimentin and versican. Intriguingly, KC-iDP constructs more intensely expressed KRT33A, KRT82, and LEF1, which were stepwisely upregulated by the addition of WNT ligand and the mixture of WNT, SHH, and EDA signaling activators, supporting the idea that iDP exhibited biological properties analogous to DP cell aggregates in the constructs in vitro.

These cells expressed neural markers upon isolation and maintained stemness for a minimum of 10 passages. Furthermore, HF-MSCs showed responsiveness to pro-inflammatory environments by expressing type-II major histocompatibility complex antigens (MHC)-II to a lesser extent than adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs). HF-MSCs effectively inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells equivalently to AT-MSCs. Additionally, HF-MSCs promoted the induction of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells to the same extent as AT-MSCs. Finally, HF-MSCs, more so than AT-MSCs, skewed M0 and M1 macrophages towards M2 phenotypes, with upregulation of typical M2 markers CD163 and CD206 and downregulation of M1 markers such as CD64, CD86, and MHC-II.

71,19474150,15200,F000001,1,"KGF and EGF signalling block hair follicle induction and promote interfollicular epidermal fate in developing mouse skin. A key initial event in hair follicle morphogenesis is the localised thickening of the skin epithelium to form a placode, partitioning future hair follicle epithelium from interfollicular epidermis. Although many developmental signalling pathways are implicated in follicle morphogenesis, the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, also known as FGF7) receptors are not defined. EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands have previously been shown to inhibit developing hair follicles; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been characterised. Here we show that receptors for EGF and KGF undergo marked downregulation in hair follicle placodes from multiple body sites, whereas the expression of endogenous ligands persist throughout hair follicle initiation. Using embryonic skin organ culture, we show that when skin from the sites of primary pelage and whisker follicle development is exposed to increased levels of two ectopic EGFR ligands (HBEGF and amphiregulin) and the FGFR2(IIIb) receptor ligand KGF, follicle formation is inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We then used downstream molecular markers and microarray profiling to provide evidence that, in response to KGF and EGF signalling, epidermal differentiation is promoted at the expense of hair follicle fate. We propose that hair follicle initiation in placodes requires downregulation of the two pathways in question, both of which are crucial for the ongoing development of the interfollicular epidermis. We have also uncovered a previously unrecognised role for KGF signalling in the formation of hair follicles in the mouse.",hair Follicle,HBEGF

BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) network is essential for proper development and homeostasis of skin and hair. However, detailed dissection of the role of the EGFR in hair follicle development and cycling have been impaired by the early mortality of EGFR knockout mice. OBJECTIVES: We have studied in Waved-5 mice carrying an antimorphic EGFR allele (Egfr(wa5)), whose product acts as a dominant-negative receptor, whether strongly reduced EGFR signaling impacts on the hair and skin phenotype. METHODS: Histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry were employed to study hair follicle morphogenesis stages and cycle induction in Waved-5 mice and control littermates during embryonic development and postnatal life. RESULTS: By routine histology and quantitative histomorphometry, no significant abnormalities in the epidermis and in hair follicle morphogenesis were detected, while the initiation of hair follicle cycling was slightly, but significantly retarded. Proliferation and apoptosis of epidermal and hair matrix keratinocytes of Waved-5 mice appeared unaltered. Intriguingly, the thickness of the subcutis and the percentage of proliferating subcutaneous adipocytes were significantly reduced in Waved-5 mice around days P8.5 to P10.5. Although no differences in total body weight gain could be detected, Wa5 mice showed a significant reduction in the percentage of body fat at P8.5. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the presence of effective compensatory mechanisms in murine skin in vivo that ensure nearly normal epidermal and hair follicle keratinocyte function despite very low levels of EGFR-mediated signaling.

The understanding of the anatomy and development of fetal and adult hair follicles and the molecular study of the major embryonic pathways that regulate the hair follicle have led to exciting discoveries concerning the development of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). These studies have shed light on the major roles of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling and its interactions with the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis in BCC development. New work, for example, explores a link between Shh signaling and IGF binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) in the hair follicle as it transforms into BCC. IGFBP-2 was overexpressed in specific hair follicle cells of mice with ectopically activated Shh signaling [keratin 14 (K14)-Cre: patched homologue 1 (Cre: Ptch1)(lox/lox) mice]. Ptch1 deletion resulted in both an expansion of the stem cell niche and inhibition of cell differentiation. In transformed hair follicles, IGFBP-2 mediates epidermal progenitor cell expansion.

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is key for normal epidermal morphogenesis, but little is known about its role in hair follicle stem cells and epidermal regeneration. Hair follicle stem cells are important contributors to newly formed epidermis following injury. We inactivated the Ilk gene in the keratin 15--expressing stem cell population of the mouse hair follicle bulge. Loss of ILK expression in these cells resulted in impaired cutaneous wound healing, with substantially decreased wound closure rates. ILK-deficient stem cells produced very few descendants that moved toward the epidermal surface and into the advancing epithelium that covers the wound. Furthermore, those few mutant cells that homed in the regenerated epidermis exhibited a reduced residence time. Paradoxically, ILK-deficient bulge stem cells responded to anagen growth signals and contributed to newly regenerated hair follicles during this phase of hair follicle growth. Thus ILK plays an important modulatory role in the normal contribution of hair follicle stem cell progeny to the regenerating epidermis following injury.",hair Follicle stem cells,keratin 15

Integrin alphavbeta6 is an epithelial-specific receptor that binds and activates latent transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). TGF-beta1 has been implicated as an endogenous inducer of hair follicle (HF) regression during hair cycling. We hypothesized that alphavbeta6 integrin-mediated TGF-beta1 signaling regulates hair regeneration and HF involution. In wild-type (WT) mice, the expression of integrin alphavbeta6 was strongly upregulated in the outer root sheath (ORS) during early hair regeneration, and was specifically enhanced in the HF bulge region. Expression gradually decreased in late anagen and remained restricted to the bulge region in the catagen and telogen stage HFs. The first spontaneous hair cycle was not altered in beta6 integrin knockout (beta6(-/-)) mice. However, after depilation, beta6(-/-) mice exhibited retarded HF regression compared with WT controls. beta6(-/-) follicles contained significantly higher numbers of proliferating Ki67-positive keratinocytes than WT follicles at an identical cycle stage. The beta6(-/-) follicles also demonstrated significantly reduced levels of TGF-beta1 expression and Smad2 phosphorylation during early anagen and anagen-catagen transition. Our study indicates that alphavbeta6 integrin has an important inhibitory role in keratinocyte proliferation in both HFs and interfollicular epidermis.

In this study, we investigated the presence and localization of beta-catenin and Lef-1 in murine hair follicles through the first postnatal month, which encompasses the first hair cycle in mice, using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Our results show that beta-catenin and Lef-1 are expressed during all stages in a hair cycle, most strongly in the anagen and weakly in the catagen and telogen phases.

To direct ODC expression in distinct epidermal compartments, we have developed keratin 6 (K6)-ODC/SKH-1 and keratin 14 (K14)-ODC/SKH-1 mice and employed them to investigate the role of ODC directed to these epidermal compartments on UVB-induced carcinogenesis. K6-driven ODC over-expression directed to outer root sheath (ORS) of hair follicle was more effective in augmenting tumorigenesis as compared to mice where K14-driven ODC expression was directed to inter-follicular epidermal keratinocytes. Chronically UVB-irradiated K6-ODC/SKH-1 developed 15+-2.5 tumors/mouse whereas K14-ODC/SKH-1 developed only 6.8+-1.5 tumors/mouse. K6-ODC/SKH-1 showed augmented UVB-induced proliferation and much higher pro-inflammatory responses than K14-ODC/SKH-1 mice. Tumors induced in K6-ODC/SKH-1 were rapidly growing, invasive and ulcerative squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) showing decreased expression of epidermal polarity marker E-cadherin and enhanced mesenchymal marker, fibronectin. Interestingly, the number of CD34/CK15/p63 positive stem-like cells was significantly higher in chronically UVB-irradiated K6-ODC/SKH-1 as compared to K14-ODC/SKH-1 mice. Reduced Notch1 expression was correlated with the expansion of stem cell compartment in these animals. However, other signaling pathways such as DNA damage response or mTOR signaling pathways were not significantly different in tumors induced in these two murine models suggesting the specificity of Notch pathway in this regard. These data provide a novel role of ODC in augmenting tumorigenesis via negatively regulated Notch-mediated expansion of stem cell compartment.",hair Follicle,CK15

Keloid is a skin fibrotic disease with the characteristics of recurrence and invasion, its pathogenesis still remains unrevealed. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for wound healing, fibrosis, recurrence, and invasion of cancer. We sought to investigate the EMT in keloid and the mechanism through which the EMT regulates keloid formation. In keloid tissues, the expressions of EMT-associated markers and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1/Smad3 signaling were examined by immunohistochemistry. In the keloid epidermis and dermal tissue, the expressions of genes related to the regulation of skin homeostasis, fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and p63, were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that accompanying the loss of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and the gain of the mesenchymal markers fibroblast-specific protein 1 (FSP1) and vimentin in epithelial cells from epidermis and skin appendages, and in endothelial cells from dermal microvessels, enhanced TGF-beta1 expression and Smad3 phosphorylation were noted in keloid tissues. Moreover, alternative splicing of the FGFR2 gene switched the predominantly expressed isoform from FGFR2-IIIb to -IIIc, concomitant with the decreased expression of DeltaNp63 and TAp63, which changes might partially account for abnormal epidermis and appendages in keloids. In addition, we found that TGF-beta1-induced hair follicle outer root sheath keratinocytes (ORSKs) and normal skin epithelial cells underwent EMT in vitro with ORSKs exhibiting more obvious EMT changes and more similar expression profiles for EMT-associated and skin homeostasis-related genes as in keloid tissues, suggesting that ORSKs might play crucial roles in the EMT in keloids.

Human hair follicle mesenchymal stem cells (hHFMSCs) are an important source of cardiovascular tissue engineering for their differentiation potential into smooth muscle cells (SMCs), yet the molecular pathways underlying such fate determination is unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in cell differentiation. In present study, we found that miR-128 was remarkably decreased during the differentiation of hHFMSCs into SMCs induced by transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Moreover, overexpression of miR-128 led to decreased expression of SMC cellular marker proteins, such as smooth muscle actin (SMA) and calponin, in TGF-beta1-induced SMC differentiation. Further, we identified that miR-128 targeted the 3'-UTR of SMAD2 transcript for translational inhibition of SMAD2 protein, and knockdown of SMAD2 abrogated the promotional effect of antagomir-128 (miR-128 neutralizer) on SMC differentiation. These results suggest that miR-128 regulates the differentiation of hHFMSCs into SMCs via targeting SMAD2, a main transcription regulator in TGF-beta signaling pathway involving SMC differentiation. The miR-128/SMAD2 axis could therefore be considered as a candidate target in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine for SMCs.",hair Follicle mesenchymal stem cells,TGF-beta

Emerging research revealed the essential role of mitochondria in regulating stem/progenitor cell differentiation of neural progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells and other stem cells through reactive oxygen species (ROS), Notch or other signaling pathway. Inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis results in hair loss upon injury. However, alteration of mitochondrial morphology and metabolic function during hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) differentiation and how they affect hair regeneration has not been elaborated upon. Methods. We compared the difference in mitochondrial morphology and activity between telogen bulge cells and anagen matrix cells. Expression levels of mitochondrial ROS and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) were measured to evaluate redox balance. In addition, the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were estimated to present the change in energetic metabolism during differentiation. To explore the effect of the mitochondrial metabolism on regulating hair regeneration, hair growth was observed after application of a mitochondrial respiratory inhibitor upon hair plucking. Results. During HFSCs differentiation, mitochondria became elongated with more abundant organized cristae and showed higher activity in differentiated cells. SOD2 was enhanced for redox balance with relatively stable ROS levels in differentiated cells. PDK increased in HFSCs while differentiated cells showed enhanced PDH, indicating that respiration switched from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation during differentiation. Inhibiting mitochondrial respiration in differentiated hair follicle cells upon hair plucking repressed hair regeneration in vivo. Conclusions. Upon HFSCs differentiation, mitochondria are elongated with more abundant cristae and show higher activity, accompanying with activated aerobic respiration in differentiated cells for higher energy supply. Also, dysfunction of mitochondrial respiration delays hair regeneration upon injury.",hair Follicle stem cell,pyruvate dehydrogenase
88,27287810,1499,F000001,1,"Inhibition of beta-catenin signalling in dermal fibroblasts enhances hair follicle regeneration during wound healing. New hair follicles (HFs) do not form in adult mammalian skin unless epidermal Wnt signalling is activated genetically or within large wounds. To understand the postnatal loss of hair forming ability we monitored HF formation at small circular (2 mm) wound sites. At P2, new HFs formed in back skin, but HF formation was markedly decreased by P21. Neonatal tail also formed wound-associated HFs, albeit in smaller numbers. Postnatal loss of HF neogenesis did not correlate with wound closure rate but with a reduction in Lrig1-positive papillary fibroblasts in wounds. Comparative gene expression profiling of back and tail dermis at P1 and dorsal fibroblasts at P2 and P50 showed a correlation between loss of HF formation and decreased expression of genes associated with proliferation and Wnt/beta-catenin activity. Between P2 and P50, fibroblast density declined throughout the dermis and clones of fibroblasts became more dispersed. This correlated with a decline in fibroblasts expressing a TOPGFP reporter of Wnt activation. Surprisingly, between P2 and P50 there was no difference in fibroblast proliferation at the wound site but Wnt signalling was highly upregulated in healing dermis of P21 compared with P2 mice. Postnatal beta-catenin ablation in fibroblasts promoted HF regeneration in neonatal and adult mouse wounds, whereas beta-catenin activation reduced HF regeneration in neonatal wounds. Our data support a model whereby postnatal loss of hair forming ability in wounds reflects elevated dermal Wnt/beta-catenin activation in the wound bed, increasing the abundance of fibroblasts that are unable to induce HF formation.",hair Follicles,beta-catenin

In androgenetic alopecia, androgens impair dermal papilla-induced hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) differentiation inhibiting Wnt signaling. Wnt agonists/antagonists balance was analyzed after dihydrotestosterone (DHT) stimulation in androgen-sensitive dermal papilla cells (DPC) cultured as spheroids or monolayer. In both culture conditions, DHT stimulation downregulated Wnt5a and Wnt10b mRNA while the Wnt antagonist Dkk-1 was upregulated. Notably, tissue architecture of DPC-spheroids lowers Dkk-1 and enhances Wnt agonists' basal expression; probably contributing to DPC inductivity. The role of Wnt agonists/antagonists as mediators of androgen inhibition of DPC-induced HFSC differentiation was evaluated. Inductive DPC-conditioned medium supplemented with DKK-1 impaired HFSC differentiation mimicking androgens' action. This effect was associated with inactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in differentiating HFSC by both DPC-conditioned media. Moreover, addition of WNT10b to DPC-medium conditioned with DHT, overcame androgen inhibition of HFSC differentiation. Our results identify DKK1 and WNT10b as paracrine factors which modulate the HFSC differentiation inhibition involved in androgen-driven balding.",hair Follicle stem cell,beta-catenin

Although hair loss or alopecia is a common disease, its exact mechanisms are not yet well understood. The present study investigated the hypothesis that the homeostatic regulation of genes during hair regeneration may participate in hair loss, based on the cyclicity of hair growth. A cluster of such genes was identified by an expression gene-array from the dorsal skin in a depilated mouse model, and CXCL4 was identified as a significantly regulated gene during the hair regeneration process. To elucidate the function of CXCL4 in hair growth, CXCL4 activity was blocked by the administration of an anti-CXCL4 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Histomorphometric analysis indicated that anti-CXCL4 mAb induced an earlier anagen phase and delayed hair follicle regression, in contrast with that in the control group. Moreover, CXCL4 mAb upregulated the transcription levels of several hair growth-related genes, including Lef1, Wnt10b, Bmp4 and Bmp2. In addition, CXCL4 mAb increased the levels of the proliferation-related protein PCNA and Bcl-2 during the anagen phase, while it reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved caspase-3 during the catagen phase. These findings reveal that CXCL4 plays an important role in hair growth, and that blockade of CXCL4 activity promotes hair growth.",hair regeneration,Bcl-2

Introduction: Regarding the limited ability of the damaged cartilage cells to self-renew, which is due to their specific tissue structure, subtle damages can usually cause diseases such as osteoarthritis. In this work, using laser photobiomodulation and an interesting source of growth factors cocktail called the synovial fluid, we analyzed the chondrogenic marker genes in treated hair follicle dermal papilla cells as an accessible source of cells with relatively high differentiation potential. Methods: Dermal papilla cells were isolated from rat whisker hair follicle (Rattus norvegicus) and established cell cultures were treated with a laser (gallium aluminum arsenide diode Laser (lambda=780 nm, 30 mW) at 5 J/cm2 ), the synovial fluid, and a combination of both. After 1, 4, 7, and 14 days, the morphological changes were evaluated and the expression levels of four chondrocyte marker genes (Col2a1, Sox-9, Col10a1, and Runx-2) were assessed by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: It was monitored that treating cells with laser irradiation can accelerate the rate of proliferation of cells. The morphology of the cells treated with the synovial fluid altered considerably as in the fourth day they surprisingly looked like cultured articular chondrocytes. The gene expression analysis showed that all genes were up-regulated until the day 14 following the treatments although not equally in all the cell groups. Moreover, the cell groups treated with both irradiation and the synovial fluid had a significantly augmented expression in gene markers. Conclusion: Based on the gene expression levels and the morphological changes, we concluded that the synovial fluid can have the potential to make the dermal papilla cells to most likely mimic the chondrogenic and/or osteogenic differentiation, although this process seems to be augmented by the irradiation of the low-level laser.",hair Follicle,Runx-2

The purpose of this study was to use an in vivo model of hair follicle (HF)-mimic based on a human dermal papilla (DP) spheroid system prepared by three-dimensional (3D) culture and to investigate the effect of Rg4 on the hair-inductive properties of DP cells. Treatment of the DP spheroids with Rg4 (20 to 50 mug/ml) significantly increased the viability and size of the DP spheres in a dose-dependent manner. Rg4 also increased the mRNA and protein expression of DP signature genes that are related to hair growth including ALP, BMP2, and VCAN in the DP spheres. Analysis of the signaling molecules and luciferase reporter assays further revealed that Rg4 induces the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and the inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3beta, which activates the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway. These results correlated with not only the increased nuclear translocation of beta-catenin following the treatment of the DP spheres with Rg4 but also the significant elevation of mRNA expression of the downstream target genes of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway including WNT5A, beta-catenin, and LEF1. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg4 promotes the hair-inductive properties of DP cells by activating the AKT/GSK3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway in DP spheres, suggesting that Rg4 could be a potential natural therapy for hair growth.",Dermal Papilla,BMP2

Enhanced telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) levels in dermal keratinocytes can serve as a novel target for hair growth promotion. Previously, we identified fisetin using a system for screening food components that can activate the TERT promoter in HaCaT cells (keratinocytes). In the present study, we aimed to clarify the molecular basis of fisetin-induced hair growth promotion in mice. To this end, the dorsal skin of mice was treated with fisetin, and hair growth was evaluated 12 days after treatment. Histochemical analyses of fisetin-treated skin samples and HaCaT cells were performed to observe the effects of fisetin. The results showed that fisetin activated HaCaT cells by regulating the expression of various genes related to epidermogenesis, cell proliferation, hair follicle regulation, and hair cycle regulation. In addition, fisetin induced the secretion of exosomes from HaCaT cells, which activated beta-catenin and mitochondria in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and induced their proliferation. Moreover, these results revealed the existence of exosomes as the molecular basis of keratinocyte-HFSC interaction and showed that fisetin, along with its effects on keratinocytes, caused exosome secretion, thereby activating HFSCs. This is the first study to show that keratinocyte-derived exosomes can activate HFSCs and consequently induce hair growth.",hair Follicle stem cells,telomerase reverse transcriptase

INTRODUCTION: Although it has been reported that the anti-diabetic drug metformin has multiple extra-hypoglycemic activities, such as anti-oxidation, anti-aging and even anti-tumor, topical metformin also can induce hair regeneration, but the precise mechanism involved in that process is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of metformin on hair growth in a mouse hair follicle reconstitution model generated by in vitro self-assembled three-dimensional aggregates of epidermal and dermal cells (3D aggregates). METHODS: Epidermal cells and dermal cells were isolated and cultured from the mouse skin of fifty C57BL/6 mouse pups (1-day-old). For tracing the distribution of dermal cells during the self-assembly process of 3D aggregates, the dermal cells were labeled with Vybrant Dil cell-labelling solution and mixed with epidermal cells at 1:1 ratio. Formed 3D aggregates were treated with 10 mM metformin and then were grafted into recipient BALB/c nude mice. The biomarkers (HGF, CD133, ALP, beta-catenin and SOX2) associated with the hair-inductive activity of dermal cells were detected in the grafted skin tissues and in cultured 3D aggregates treated with metformin using immunofluorescent staining, quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting. Furthermore, the expression levels of CD133 were also examined in dermal cells with different passage numbers using qRT-PCR and western blotting. RESULTS: Metformin directly stimulates the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of cultured 3D aggregates, upregulates both the protein and mRNA expression levels of molecular markers (HGF, CD133, ALP, beta-catenin and SOX2) and improves the survival rate of reconstituted hair follicles. Moreover, we also found that metformin increases the expression of CD133 in dermal cells thus maintaining their trichogenic capacity that would normally be lost by serial subculture. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that metformin can promote hair follicle regeneration in vitro through up-regulation of the hair inductive capability of dermal cells, warranting further evaluation in the clinical treatment of male or female pattern hair loss.",hair Follicles,HGF

Normally asymptomatic, inflammatory outgrowth of mites can accompany malnutrition, immune dysfunction, and aging, but mechanisms restricting Demodex outgrowth are not defined. Here, we show that control of mite HF colonization in mice required group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), interleukin-13 (IL-13), and its receptor, IL-4Ra-IL-13Ra1. HF-associated ILC2s elaborated IL-13 that attenuated HFs and epithelial proliferation at anagen onset; in their absence, Demodex colonization led to increased epithelial proliferation and replacement of gene programs for repair by aberrant inflammation, leading to the loss of barrier function and HF exhaustion. Humans with rhinophymatous acne rosacea, an inflammatory condition associated with Demodex, had increased HF inflammation with decreased type 2 cytokines, consistent with the inverse relationship seen in mice.

Dlx homeobox transcription factors regulate epidermal, neural and osteogenic cellular differentiation. Here, we demonstrate the central role of Dlx3 as a crucial transcriptional regulator of hair formation and regeneration. The selective ablation of Dlx3 in the epidermis results in complete alopecia owing to failure of the hair shaft and inner root sheath to form, which is caused by the abnormal differentiation of the cortex. Significantly, we elucidate the regulatory cascade that positions Dlx3 downstream of Wnt signaling and as an upstream regulator of other transcription factors that regulate hair follicle differentiation, such as Hoxc13 and Gata3. Colocalization of phospho-Smad1/5/8 and Dlx3 is consistent with a regulatory role for BMP signaling to Dlx3 during hair morphogenesis. Importantly, mutant catagen follicles undergo delayed regression and display persistent proliferation. Moreover, ablation of Dlx3 expression in the telogen bulge stem cells is associated with a loss of BMP signaling, precluding re-initiation of the hair follicle growth cycle. Taken together with hair follicle abnormalities in humans with Tricho-Dento-Osseous (TDO) syndrome, an autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia linked to mutations in the DLX3 gene, our results establish that Dlx3 is essential for hair morphogenesis, differentiation and cycling programs.",hair morphogenesis,Dlx3

Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma)-induced collapse of hair follicle (HF) immune privilege (IP) is a key element in the pathogenesis of alopecia areata. In this pilot study, we investigated whether the immunosuppressive neuropeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), can protect from and/or restore IFNgamma-induced HF-IP collapse. After showing that human scalp HFs express CGRP receptor-like receptor (CRLR) immunoreactivity, anagen HFs were cultured in the presence of IFNgamma, with CGRP added before or after. Adding CGRP after IFNgamma administration ('restoration assay') failed to downregulate IFNgamma-induced ectopic MHC class I expression, while MHC class II expression was reduced. However, administering CGRP before IFNgamma application ('protection assay') significantly reduced the IFNgamma-induced overexpression and ectopic expression of MHC class I and II and reduced the increased degranulation of perifollicular mast cells induced by IFNgamma. This suggests that CGRP may not restore HF-IP once it has collapsed, but may protect it from collapsing.

EPCs derived from three hiPSC lines generated with 4 or 3 factors (POU5F1, SOX2, KLF4 +/- MYC) mostly expressed keratin 18, a marker of epithelial progenitors. When cocultured with human dermal papilla (DP) cells, a 4 factor 201B7 hiPSC-EPC line upregulated follicular keratinocyte (KC) markers more significantly than normal human adult KCs (NHKCs) and other hiPSC-EPC lines. DP cells preferentially increased DP biomarker expression in response to this line. Interestingly, 201B7 hiPSCs were shown to be ectodermal/epithelial prone, and the derived EPCs were putatively in a wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT)-activated state. Importantly, co-transplantation of 201B7 hiPSC-EPCs, but not NHKCs, with trichogenic mice dermal cells into immunodeficient mice resulted in HF formation.

BACKGROUND: Keratinocytes in the hair follicle bulge region have a high proliferative capacity, with characteristics of epithelial stem cells. This cell population might thus be an ideal source for generating the interfollicular epidermis in a canine skin equivalent. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to determine the ability of canine hair follicle bulge cell-enriched keratinocytes to construct canine living skin equivalents with interfollicular epidermis in vitro. ANIMALS: Four healthy beagle dogs from a research colony. METHODS: Bulge cell-enriched keratinocytes showing keratin 15 immunoreactivity were isolated from canine hair follicles and cultured on dermal equivalent containing canine fibroblasts. Skin equivalents were subjected to histological, immunohistochemical, western blot and RT-PCR analyses after 10-14 days of culture at the air-liquid interface. RESULTS: The keratinocyte sheets showed an interfollicular epidermal structure comprising four to five living cell layers covered with a horny layer. Immunoreactivities for keratin 14 and desmoglein 3 were detected in the basal and immediate suprabasilar layers of the epidermis, while keratin 10 and desmoglein 1 occurred in more superficial layers. Claudin 1 immunoreactivity was seen in the suprabasalar layer of the constructed epidermis, and filaggrin monomers and loricrin were detected in the uppermost layer. Basal keratinocytes in the skin equivalent demonstrated immunoreactivity to antibodies against basement membrane zone molecules. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: A bulge stem cell-enriched population from canine hair follicles formed interfollicular epidermis within 2 weeks in vitro, and thus represents a promising model for regenerative therapy of canine skin.",hair Follicle bulge,keratin 15

In human hair follicles (HFs), it is prominently expressed in the inner hair matrix that harbors the HF pigmentary unit. However, the role of P-cadherin in normal human pigmentation remains unknown. As patients with mutations in the gene that encodes P-cadherin show hypotrichosis and fair hair, we explored the hypothesis that P-cadherin may control HF pigmentation. When P-cadherin was silenced in melanogenically active organ-cultured human scalp HFs, this significantly reduced HF melanogenesis and tyrosinase activity as well as gene and/or protein expression of gp100, stem cell factor, c-Kit, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), both in situ and in isolated human HF melanocytes. Instead, epidermal pigmentation was unaffected by P-cadherin knockdown in organ-cultured human skin. In hair matrix keratinocytes, P-cadherin silencing reduced plasma membrane beta-catenin, whereas glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) and phospho-beta-catenin expression were significantly upregulated. This suggests that P-cadherin-GSK3beta/Wnt signaling is required for maintaining the expression of MITF to sustain intrafollicular melanogenesis.

131,23796167,3880,F000034,1,"Effect of intense pulsed light treatment on human skin in vitro: analysis of immediate effects on dermal papillae and hair follicle stem cells. BACKGROUND: Hair follicles house a permanent pool of epithelial stem cells. Intense pulsed light (IPL) sources have been successfully used for hair removal, but long-term hair reduction may require several treatments. Many questions remain regarding the impact of IPL treatment on the structure of the hair follicle, more specifically on hair follicular stem cells and dermal papilla cells, a group of specialized cells that orchestrate hair growth. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the destruction of human hair follicles and surrounding tissues following IPL treatment, with more attention paid to the bulge and the bulb regions. METHODS: Human scalp specimens of Fitzpatrick skin phototype II were exposed ex vivo to IPL pulses and were then processed for histological analysis, immunodetection of stem cell-associated keratin 19, and revelation of the endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity expressed in dermal papilla cells. RESULTS: Histological analysis confirmed that pigmented structures, such as the melanin-rich matrix cells of the bulb in anagen follicles and the hair shaft, are principally targeted by IPL treatment, while white hairs and epidermis remained unaffected. Damage caused by heat sometimes extended over the dermal papilla cells, while stem cells were mostly spared. CONCLUSIONS: IPL epilation principally targets pigmented structures. Our results suggest that, under the tested conditions, collateral damage does not deplete stem cells. Damage at the dermal papilla was observed only with high-energy treatment modalities. Extrapolated to frequently treated hairs, these observations explain why some hairs grow back after a single IPL treatment.",dermal papilla cells,keratin 19

Exp Dermatol 2014 evaluated the effect of leptin on hair follicle cycling using mutant and wild-type mice. They report that leptin is produced in dermal papilla cells in hair follicles and that leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice show an abnormality in hair follicle cycling. Moreover, leptin injection induced the transition into the growth stage of the hair cycle (anagen). On this basis, it now deserves exploration whether leptin-mediated signalling is a key stimulus for anagen induction and whether this may be targeted to manage human hair disorders with defect in the control of hair follicle cycling.",dermal papilla cells,Leptin

OBJECTIVES: To close the knowledge gap in the expression of ABC transporters in the human hair follicle (HF). METHODS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of ABC genes and immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of cryosections of human HFs. RESULTS: By qPCR analysis, numerous members of the ABC transporter superfamily, such as ABCB1, ABCG2 and ABCA12, were found to be transcribed in full-length human scalp HFs. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the intrafollicular protein expression of different xenobiotic ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC4, ABCG2) varies greatly, with ABCG2 expression restricted primarily to the epithelial stem cell region of the outer root sheath (bulge), whereas expression of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCC4 was more widespread.

Here, we describe a differential enrichment approach to derive HFSCs from hair follicles of vibrissae and ear skin using the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632. In the presence of Y-27632, primary cultured hair follicle cells grew in clustered colonies surrounded by keratinocyte-like cells and simultaneously expressed three HFSC markers: CD34, K15, and ITGB1. HFSCs cultured in medium containing Y-27632 were presented at a stable ratio of 30.7%, 34.1%, and 32.9% after passages 5, 10, and 15, respectively. By contrast, in medium containing epidermal growth factor, clustered HFSC colonies disappeared after 6 passages and lacked HFSC marker expression. After withdrawal of Y-27632 from the medium, HFSCs rapidly differentiated into keratinocyte-like cells. Furthermore, HFSCs derived with Y-27632 formed spherical clusters in collagen matrix in vitro, differentiated into keratinocytes and adipose cells under in vitro induction conditions, and cooperated with fetal dermal cells to regenerate hair follicles in vivo 6 weeks after their intracutaneous injection into immune-deficient mice.

144,31894311,7422,F000001,1,"Protective effects of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells against dexamethasone-induced apoptotic cell death in hair follicles. Alopecia is a common and distressing condition, and developing new therapeutic agents to prevent hair loss is important. Human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) have been studied intensively in regenerative medicine. However, the therapeutic potential of these cells against hair loss and hair organ damage remains unclear, and the effects of hUCB-MSC transplantation on hair loss require evaluation. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of hUCB-MSCs on hair regression in vivo and restoration of anagen conduction on hair growth in vitro. The effects of hUCB-MSCs were explored in mouse catagen induction models using a topical treatment of 0.1% dexamethasone to induce hair regression. Dexamethasone was also used to simulate a stress environment in vitro. The results demonstrated that hUCB-MSCs significantly prevented hair regression induced by dexamethasone topical stimulation in vivo. Additionally, hUCB-MSCs significantly increased the proliferation of human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and HaCaT cells, which are key constituent cells of the hair follicle. Stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and decreased expression of DKK-1 by hUCB-MSCs were also observed in hDPCs. Restoration of cell viability by hUCB-MSCs suggested that these cells exerted a protective effect on glucocorticoid stress-associated hair loss.

Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) is primarily recognized as an inhibitory receptor involved in the regulation of immunological tolerance. However, recent studies have indicated that PD-1/PD-L1 signaling could also regulate the functions of nonimmune cells and may be involved in regulating hair biology. In this study, we showed in a mouse model of depilation-induced hair cycling that PD-1/PD-L1 are expressed in the murine epidermis and hair follicle (HF) in a hair cycle-dependent manner. During HF morphogenesis, PD-1 expression was strongly decreased during the anagen phase compared with the catagen and telogen phases. PD-L1 expression was enhanced during the catagen phase compared with the anagen and telogen phases. Moreover, direct blockade of PD-L1 not only accelerated hair anagen phase onset but also delayed catagen progression. In conclusion, our findings indicated that PD-1/PD-L1 signaling may act as a negative regulator of hair cycle transition. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy may thus be a promising strategy for treating anagen-reduced hair loss.",hair Follicle,PD-L1

However, their expression and role during the hair cycle are unknown. This study aims to investigate the expression of CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, in the vicinity of hair follicles and their effect on hair growth. CXCL12 was highly expressed in dermal fibroblasts (DFs) and its level was elevated throughout the catagen and telogen phases of the hair cycle. CXCR4 is expressed in the dermal papilla (DP) and outer root sheath (ORS). In hair organ culture, hair loss was induced by recombinant CXCL12 therapy, which delayed the telogen-to-anagen transition and decreased hair length. In contrast, the suppression of CXCL12 using a neutralizing antibody and siRNA triggered the telogen-to-anagen transition and increased hair length in hair organ culture. Neutralization of CXCR7, one of the two receptors for CXCL12, only slightly affected hair growth. However, inhibition of CXCR4, the other receptor for CXCL12, increased hair growth to a considerable extent.

Common anti-hair loss drugs carry some side-effects, therefore, novel, safer approaches targeting milder phenotypes are highly advocated. In this context, we investigated an extract of the alpine plant Edelweiss, Leontopodium alpinum var. Helvetia, for its ability to modulate hair follicle (HF) growth ex vivo and inhibit hair loss while increasing hair regeneration in vivo. METHODS: Human amputated HFs were micro-dissected from three donors, two females and one male, and cultured ex vivo for 6 days. After treatment with 0.001% Edelweiss extract (EWDE), we investigated hair shaft production, and anagen/catagen conversion, and measured known parameters associated with hair growth, i.e., hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation and apoptosis, dermal papilla inductivity, and growth factors, by quantitative (immuno-) histomorphometry. To assess the anti-hair loss potential of the alpine plant compound, we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled human study enrolling Caucasian women and men, aged 18 to 65 years, with normal hair loss. After five months' daily use of an extract containing leave-on serum, we analysed hair density and anagen to catagen/telogen ratio by Trichogram analysis. RESULTS: Our results revealed a significant prolongation in the anagen phase in HFs treated with 0.001% Edelweiss, as indicated by an increase in HFs remaining in anagen and a significant decrease in hair cycle score. In line with this effect, EWDE significantly stimulated hair matrix (HM) keratinocyte proliferation, and dermal papilla inductivity, as shown by a significant up-regulation of versican expression and alkaline phosphatase activity, and a tendential increase in FGF7 immunoreactivity in the dermal papilla of all HFs or only anagen VI HFs. Corroborating the ex vivo results, we observed a significant increase in growing hair shaft numbers (hair density) after treatment with Edelweiss extract formulation, and a tendential up-regulation in the anagen to catagen-telogen ratio.

155,35561753,24088,F000001,1,"Timely Wound Healing is Dependent upon Endothelial but not Hair Follicle Stem Cell Toll-like Receptor 2 Signaling. As a part of innate immunity, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) plays an important function in most defensive responses of the organism, including but not limited to infections. Cutaneous injury, one of the most common challenges for mammals, mobilizes a number of cell types, including epithelial, immune, and vascular cells for timely tissue repair. However, in contrast to immune cells, little is known about TLR2 function on non-immune cells during skin regeneration. Here, we used two tissue-specific conditional TLR2 knockout mouse lines to address the impact of TLR2 in endothelial and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) on cutaneous wound healing. The loss of TLR2 on endothelial cells diminishes their ability to migrate, sprout, and proliferate in response to specific TLR2 ligands, and also reduces the secretion of key pro-angiogenic factors. Lack of TLR2 on endothelial cells prolongs wound healing due to diminished angiogenesis. TLR2 is expressed in key structures of hair follicle including HFSCs, secondary hair germ, and dermal papilla. Despite the prominent role for HFSCs in skin regeneration, excision of TLR2 from HFSCs has no impact on their proliferation or wound healing potential. Our study demonstrates that timely tissue regeneration after skin injury is dependent upon endothelial TLR2 for robust angiogenesis, while HFSC TLR2 is dispensable.",hair Follicle,Toll-like Receptor 2

BACKGROUND: Proteoglycans (PGs) are known to play key roles in many cellular signalling pathways involved in hair follicle biology. Although some PG core proteins have previously been described in adult human hair follicles, their glycosaminoglycan (GAG) moieties have been less studied. OBJECTIVES: To add knowledge about PG core protein and GAG distributions in human anagen hair follicle and, for selected follicles, during catagen. METHODS: We used immunohistochemistry and immunohistofluorescence to revisit the expression pattern of GAG chains and core proteins in human hair follicle. The studied epitopes included CD44v3, syndecan-1, perlecan, versican, aggrecan, biglycan, heparan sulphate (HS), chondroitin sulphate (CS), dermatan sulphate (DS) and keratan sulphate (KS). RESULTS: The membrane PGs syndecan-1 and CD44v3 were respectively detected in the epithelial part of whole hair and in the outer root sheath basal layer. The dermal part of the hair follicle contained high amounts of extracellular PGs such as perlecan, versican, aggrecan, biglycan and their saccharidic moieties, namely HS, CS, DS and KS. We also observed a variable distribution of these components along the hair follicle. Especially, we noted a PG impoverishment at the very bottom of the anagen bulb. Moreover, while type D chondroitin expression remained unaffected, 4C3-CS and PG4-CS/DS epitopes respectively decreased in the dermal papilla and the connective tissue sheath, at the onset of catagen. CONCLUSIONS: GAG and PG expression along the human anagen hair follicle was characterized by (i) discontinuities mainly affecting the basement membrane and (ii) disappearance of some epitopes at catagen onset.

163,19211676,19664,F000001,1,"Notch signaling in bulge stem cells is not required for selection of hair follicle fate. Notch signaling plays an important role in hair follicle maintenance, and it has been suggested that Notch is also required for follicular fate selection by adult hair follicle stem cells in the bulge. Here we demonstrate that, on the contrary, Notch signaling in bi-potential bulge stem cells or their uncommitted descendents acts to suppress the epidermal fate choice, thus ensuring follicular fate selection. To examine the role of Notch signaling in adult hair follicle stem cells, we used a Krt1-15-CrePR1 transgenic mouse line to delete Rbpj or all Notch proteins specifically in the bulge stem cells. We conclusively determined that in the absence of Notch signaling, bulge stem cell descendents retain their capacity to execute the follicular differentiation program but fail to maintain it owing to their genetic deficiency. The defect in terminal differentiation caused the diversion of Notch-deficient hair follicles to epidermal cysts, and the presence of wild-type cells could not prevent this conversion.

However, this developmental abnormality is not recapitulated in mice lacking closely related kinases Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3. To examine whether Akt2 interacts with SGK3 in postnatal hair development, we have generated and characterized Akt2/SGK3 double knockouts (DKOs). We find that the DKO mice have a defect in hair growth that is markedly worse than that of SGK3(-/-) mice and does not ameliorate with age. Morphologically, this defect is characterized by accelerated entry into catagen and through anagen, irregular hair follicle orientation, and increased expression of sebaceous glands. The defect is preceded by a profound failure to increase follicle matrix cell nuclear beta-catenin accumulation and proliferation at the onset of morphogenesis. Furthermore, in cultured keratinocytes, transfected Akt2 and SGK3 both stimulate transcription of a beta-catenin-LEF1-dependent reporter gene.

The Zhongwei goat is an important and unique goat breed indigenous to China. It has a natural hair curling phenotype at birth, but the degree of curling gradually decreases with growth. The molecular mechanism underlying the dynamic changes in the wool curvature in Zhongwei goats is poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in many biological processes, including hair growth and development. In this study, we selected skins from Zhongwei goats at different ages (45 and 108 days) that exhibited different levels of hair curvature and performed miRNA sequencing to explore the molecular mechanism of hair bending. In total, 28 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were identified in the three groups of samples between the two developmental stages. An analysis of the target genes of the above-mentioned DE miRNAs by the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses indicated that the DE miRNAs were involved in signal pathways which were previously associated with hair bending and hair follicle development, such as the TGF-beta/SMAD, PI3K-Akt, JAK-STAT, and MAPK pathways. A comprehensive analysis of the correlations between the miRNA-seq results and issued transcriptional findings indicated that SMAD1 was a target gene of miR-26a and SMAD5 was a target gene of miR-130a. Furthermore, goat dermal papilla cells were successfully isolated and purified to determine the role of miRNAs in follicle development in vitro. The study results demonstrated that miR-130a and miR-26a had significant effects on the proliferation of dermal papilla cells. In addition, the detection results of mRNA and protein levels indicate that the overexpression of miR-26a can promote the expression of related genes in the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway, while miR-130a has the opposite substitution effect. The dual luciferase report test showed that miR-26a targeted the SMAD1 gene and reduced the expression of the SMAD1 protein in hair papillary cells. Our results identified DE microRNAs which perhaps change at the time of hair straightening in Zhongwei goats and explore the role of miR-26a and miR-130a in dermal papilla cells proliferation.

The hair follicle (HF) is an important mini-organ of the skin, composed of many types of cells. Dermal papilla cells are important signalling components that guide the proliferation, upward migration and differentiation of HF stem cell progenitor cells to form other types of HF cells. Thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4), a major actin-sequestering protein, is involved in various cellular responses and has recently been shown to play key roles in HF growth and development. Endogenous Tbeta4 can activate the mouse HF cycle transition and affect HF growth and development by promoting the migration and differentiation of HF stem cells and their progeny. In addition, exogenous Tbeta4 increases the rate of hair growth in mice and promotes cashmere production by increasing the number of secondary HFs (hair follicles) in cashmere goats. However, the molecular mechanisms through which Tbeta4 promotes HF growth and development have rarely been reported.

Dermal papillae are a target of androgen action in patients with androgenic alopecia, where androgen acts on the epidermis of hair follicles in a paracrine manner. To mimic the complexity of the dermal papilla microenvironment, a better culture model of human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) is needed. Therefore, we evaluated the inhibitory effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated two-dimensional (2D)- and 3D-cultured DPCs on hair follicle growth. 2D- and 3D-cultured DPC proliferation was inhibited after co-culturing with outer root sheath (ORS) cells under DHT treatment. Moreover, gene expression levels of beta-catenin and neural cell adhesion molecules were significantly decreased and those of cleaved caspase-3 significantly increased in 2D- and 3D-cultured DPCs with increasing DHT concentrations. ORS cell proliferation also significantly increased after co-culturing in the control-3D model compared with the control-2D model. Ki67 downregulation and cleaved caspase-3 upregulation in DHT-treated 2D and 3D groups significantly inhibited ORS cell proliferation. Sequencing showed an increase in the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix synthesis in the 3D model group. Additionally, the top 10 hub genes were identified, and the expression of nine chemokine-related genes in DHT-treated DPCs was found to be significantly increased. We also identified the interactions between transcription factor (TF) genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) with hub genes and the TF-miRNA coregulatory network. Overall, the findings indicate that 3D-cultured DPCs are more representative of in vivo conditions than 2D-cultured DPCs and contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying androgen-induced alopecia.",ORS,beta-catenin

A novel device was designed and manufactured to precisely control the micro-injury parameters. Then the most appropriate extent of micro-injury without over-damaging the skin was evaluated. Finally, the effects of micro-injury on hair regeneration and vitiligo repigmentation were examined by macroscopical observation, histological staining, gene and protein expression analysis. We discover that proper micro-injury effectively induces hair regeneration by activating the hair follicle stem cell proliferation and migration downwards to the hair matrix, finally shifting the hair follicle stage from telogen into anagen. On vitiligo model mice, micro-injury also induces the hair follicle melanocyte stem cells to migrate upwards to the interfollicular epidermis, activating and giving rise to melanocytes to repopulate the vitiligo lesion. Mechanistic analysis indicates that the canonical Wnt/ -catenin pathway plays a key role in the micro-injury-induced repair process.

Mechanistic investigations indicated that Smurf2 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of SMAD2, thus causing downregulation of SMAD2 expression. By this mechanism, NANOG expression was reduced and the subsequent DNMT1 transcriptional expression was also diminished, leading to suppression of differentiation and apoptosis of HFSCs while stimulating cell proliferation. Moreover, in vivo data showed that Smurf2 upregulation limited epidermal wound healing in mice by inhibiting the SMAD2/NANOG/DNMT1 axis. Our work proposed a potential target regarding SMAD2 restoration in promoting HFSC differentiation and skin wound healing.",hair Follicles,DNMT1

Background: 3D organoid cultures of hair follicles (HFs) are powerful models that mimic native HF for both in-depth study of HF disease and precision therapy. However, few studies have investigated the complete structure and properties of HF organoids. To investigate and characterize the complete HF organoids self-assembled by coculture of neonatal mouse epidermal cells (MECs) and dermal cells in Matrigel. Methods: Fresh epidermal and dermal cells from newborn mice (n=4) were isolated, and cocultured (1:1 ratio) in Matrigel using DMEM/F12 medium for 1 week. During the culture, an inverted microscope was used to observe the morphology of the 3D constructs. After 1 week, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining of HF-related markers (K5, K73, AE13, and K10), HF stem cell markers (K15, CD34, CD49f), skin-derived precursor-related marker (Nestin), and dermal papillae (DP)-specific markers (SOX2 and ALP) was performed in the harvested constructs to identify the HF organoids. Results: Epidermal and dermal cells self-assembled into HF organoids comprising an infundibular cyst-like structure, a lower segment-like structure, and a bulb-like structure from tail to root. The HF organoid had multiple, well-defined compartments similar to native anagen HF. Of the three segments, K73 was expressed in the inner root sheath-like layer, AE13 was localized in the hair shaft-like structure, K5, K15, CD34, and CD49f were present in the outer root sheath-like layer, Nestin labeled the connective tissue sheath-like layer, and SOX2 and ALP were expressed in the DP-like structure. Furthermore, K10 and K73 were expressed in the infundibular cyst-like structure. The expression of these molecular proteins was consistent with native anagen HF. Conclusions: The complete HF organoid regenerated in Matrigel has specific compartments and is an excellent model to study HF disease and precision therapy.",dermal cells,CD49f
186,17223342,22337,F000011,1,"Role of the vitamin D receptor in hair follicle biology. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in numerous cells and tissues, including the skin. The critical requirement for cutaneous expression of the VDR has been proven by investigations in mice and humans lacking functional receptors. These studies demonstrate that absence of the VDR leads to the development of alopecia. The hair follicle is formed by reciprocal interactions between an epidermal placode, which gives rise to the hair follicle keratinocytes and the underlying mesoderm which gives rise to the dermal papilla. Hair follicle morphogenesis ends the second week of life in mice. Studies in VDR null mice have failed to demonstrate a cutaneous abnormality during this period of hair follicle morphogenesis. However, VDR null mice are unable to initiate a new hair cycle after the period of morphogenesis is complete, therefore, do not grow new hair. Investigations in transgenic mice have demonstrated that restricted expression of the VDR to keratinocytes is capable of preventing alopecia in the VDR null mice, thus demonstrating that the epidermal component of the hair follicle requires VDR expression to maintain normal hair follicle homeostasis. Studies were then performed to determine which regions of the VDR were required for these actions. Investigations in mice lacking the first zinc finger of the VDR have demonstrated that they express a truncated receptor containing an intact ligand binding and AF2 domain. These mice are a phenocopy of mice lacking the VDR, thus demonstrate the critical requirement of the DNA binding domain for hair follicle homeostasis. Transgenic mice expressing VDRs with mutations in either the ligand-binding domain or the AF2 domain were generated. These investigations demonstrated that mutant VDRs incapable of ligand-dependent transactivation were able to prevent alopecia.

P-cadherin is a member of the classical cadherin family that forms the transmembrane core of adherens junctions. Recently, mutations in the P-cadherin gene (CDH3) have been shown to cause two inherited diseases in humans: hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD) and ectodermal dysplasia, ectrodactyly, macular dystrophy (EEM syndrome). The common features of both diseases are sparse hair and macular dystrophy of the retina, while only EEM syndrome shows the additional finding of split hand/foot malformation (SHFM). We identified five consanguineous Pakistani families with either HJMD or EEM syndrome, and detected pathogenic mutations in the CDH3 gene of all five families. In order to define the role of P-cadherin in hair follicle and limb development, we performed expression studies on P-cadherin in the mouse embryo, and demonstrated the predominant expression of P-cadherin not only in the hair follicle placode, but also at the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb bud. Based on the evidence that mutations in the p63 gene also result in hypotrichosis and SHFM, and that the expression patterns of p63 and P-cadherin overlap in the hair follicle placode and AER, we postulated that CDH3 could be a direct transcriptional target gene of p63. We performed promoter assays and ChIP, which revealed that p63 directly interacts with two distinct regions of the CDH3 promoter. We conclude that P-cadherin is a newly defined transcriptional target gene of p63, with a crucial role in hair follicle morphogenesis as well as the AER during limb bud outgrowth in humans, whereas it is not required for either in mice.",hair Follicle morphogenesis,P-cadherin

Furthermore, we elaborate on the potential role of nerve growth factor (NGF) and substance P-dependent neurogenic inflammation in HFeSC damage, and explore how neuroendocrine signals may influence the balance between maintenance and destruction of hair follicle immune privilege, which protects these stem cells and their progeny.

Rho proteins are regulatory molecules that mediate changes in cell shape, contractility, motility and gene expression. AIM: To test the hypothesis that 'RhoB protein is expressed in the human skin and its expression undergoes hair follicle cycle dependent changes'. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of RhoB in the normal human skin and hair follicles (HFs) using immunohistochemical methods. METHODS: A total of 50 normal human scalp skin specimens were obtained from 50 females (age: 53-57 years) undergoing elective cosmetic plastic surgery. The specimens were obtained from both frontal and temporal regions of the scalp. A total of 50 HF, (35 anagen, 10 catagen and 5 telogen) were examined in each case using immunohistologic staining methods. Semiquantitative analysis was done. RESULTS: RhoB protein was strongly expressed in the various elements of the human scalp skin and hair follicles. In the epidermis, a moderate RhoB immunoreactivity was found in all layers except stratum corneum where RhoB protein was completely absent. In sebaceous glands, a strong RhoB immunoreactivity was detected in all sebaceocytes. In the hair follicles, the expression of RhoB protein showed hair follicle cycle stages-associated changes, i.e. strong expression during anagen, but weak and completely absent expressions during catagen and telogen phases, respectively. Semiquantitative analysis revealed statistically significant high expression values (staining intensity, percentage of positive cells and immunoreactivity scores) in the anagen VI hair follicles compared to either cantagen or telogen ones (p < 0.05). Similarly, RhoB protein expression was significantly high in the stratum basale, stratum spinosum and sebaceous glands compared to stratum granulosum (p < 0.05).

To examine this possibility, we studied the role of TAK1 in mouse hair follicle development and cycling as an instructive model system. By comparing keratinocyte-specific TAK1-deficient mice (Map3k7(fl/fl)K5-Cre) with control mice, we found that the number of hair germs (hair follicles precursors) in Map3k7(fl/fl)K5-Cre mice was significantly reduced at E15.5, and that subsequent hair follicle morphogenesis was retarded.

We assessed cell viability, melanogenesis and migration of melanocytes derived from HF-NCSCs after NB-UVB radiation. Tyrosinase, Tyrp1, Dct, Kit, Mc1R, Fzd4, NT3R, Ednra, EP1, TGFbetaR, Sox10, Mitf, Lef1 and Pax3 gene expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR, while Tyrosinase, Sox10 and Mitf protein expression were measured by Western blot analysis. Cell migration was measured by Boyden chamber transwell assay. RESULTS: NB-UVB increased the expression of tyrosinase during melanocytic differentiation from mouse HF-NCSCs, however, NB-UVB inhibited proliferation of melanocytes derived from HF-NCSCs. Mechanistically, increased melanocyte maturation after NB-UVB treatment was resulted from increased expression of several key melanogenic factors, including Sox10, Kit and Mc1R, which play a critical role to promote tyrosinase expression. Furthermore, the migration of the HF-NCSCs-derived melanocytes was downregulated as NB-UVB doses increased. However, the migration of HF-NCSCs was upregulated under 0.4J NB-UVB radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Those data provide in vitro evidence demonstrating some direct effects of NB-UVB on pigmentation of melanocyte lineage differentiated from HF-NCSCs, and may provide a possible mechanism for the effect of NB-UVB in vitiligo.",HF-NCSCs,Ednra

BACKGROUND: Human hair follicles are important for the renewal of new hairs and their development. The generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from hair follicles is easy due to its accessibility and availability. The pluripotent cells derived from hair follicles not only have a higher tendency to re-differentiate into hair follicles, but are also more suited for growth in hair scalp tissue microenvironment. METHODS: In this study, human hair follicular keratinocytes were used to generate iPSCs, which were then further differentiated in vitro into keratinocytes. The derived iPSCs were characterised by using immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and reverse-transcription PCR to check for its pluripotency markers expression. RESULTS: The iPSC clones expressed pluripotency markers such as TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, SSEA4, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, LEFTY, and GABRB. The well-formed three germ layers were observed during differentiation using iPSCs derived from hair follicles. The successful formation of keratioctyes from iPSCs was confirmed by the expression of cytokeratin 14 marker. DISCUSSION: Hair follicles represent a valuable keratinocytes source for in vitro hair cloning for use in treating hair balding or grafting in burn patients. Our significant findings in this report proved that hair follicles could be used to produce pluripotent stem cells and suggested that the genetic and micro-environmental elements of hair follicles might trigger higher and more efficient hair follicles re-differentiation.",hair Follicle,cytokeratin 14

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether feeder layers composed of human hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hHFDCs) are able to support human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). hHFDCs and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 and low-glucose DMEM, respectively. hHFDCs were passaged three times and subsequently characterized. hHFDCs and MEFs were mitotically inactivated with mitomycin C for 3 h prior to co-culture with H9-hESCs. hESCs were initially established on a mouse feeder layer, subsequently transferred onto a human feeder layer and split every 5 days. Cell morphology, expression of specific 'undifferentiation' markers and growth factors, and the differentiation capacity of hESCs grown on the hHFDC feeder layer were analyzed. hHFDCs are adherent to plastic, possess the classic mesenchymal stem cell phenotype [they express cluster of differentiation (CD)90, CD73 and CD105] and are able to differentiate into adipocytes, chondroblasts and osteocytes, indicating that these cells are multipotent. Population-doubling time analysis revealed that hHFDCs rapidly proliferate over 34.5 h. As a feeder layer, hHFDC behaved similarly to MEF in maintaining the morphology of hESCs. The results of alkaline phosphatase activity, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the expression of pluripotency transcription factors [octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), Nanog and sex determining region Y-box 2], and immunofluorescence assays of markers (stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 and Oct4) in hESCs co-cultured over hHFDC, indicated that the undifferentiated state of hESCs was preserved. No change in the level of growth factor transcripts (bone morphogenetic protein 4, fibroblast growth factor-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, Pigment epithelium-derived factor and transforming growth factor-beta1) was detected for either feeder layer prior to or following inactivation. Similar phenotypes of embryoid body formation, size and morphology were observed in the hHFDC and MEF feeders. In conclusion, hHFDC maintained hESCs in an undifferentiated state comparable to MEF in standard conditions, which may be an important finding regarding the establishment of stem cell-based translational applications.",hHFDCs,Nanog

Furthermore, in an in vivo study in mice, chitosan and SDACNF application promoted hair growth. The number of anagen follicles significantly increased compared with that in the control group, whereas the number of telogen follicles significantly decreased in the chitosan and SDACNF groups. In the chitosan and SDACNFs groups, moreover, the expression levels of FGF-7 and Sonic hedgehog were significantly upregulated in hair follicles.

Hair growth and morphology are generally regulated by the hair cycle in mammals. Fibroblast Growth Factor 5 (FGF5), which is a hair cycle regulator, has a role in regulating the hair cycle during the transition from the anagen phase to the catagen phase, and a hereditary long hair phenotype has been widely reported when FGF5 is mutated in humans and other species. However, there has been no such report in rabbits. Thus, the first exon of rabbit FGF5 was disrupted by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and the phenotype of FGF5-/- rabbits was characterized while using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, scanning electron microscopy, and western blotting. The results showed a significant and systemic long hair phenotype in the FGF5-/- rabbits, which indicated that FGF5 is a negative regulator of hair growth. In addition, a decreased diameter of the fiber and a higher area proportion of hair follicle clusters were determined in FGF5-/- rabbits as compared with the WT rabbits. Further investigation verified that prolonging the anagen phase in rabbits, with decreased BMP2/4 pathway signaling and increased VERSICAN pathway signaling, caused the systemic long hair phenotype. Taken together, these results indicate a systemic long hair phenotype by prolonging anagen in FGF5-/- rabbits, which could be widely used for Fur production and an ideal model for studying the mechanism of long hair in the future.",hair Follicle,FGF5

The dermal papilla cell (DPC) is a type of highly specialized mesenchymal cells located in hair follicles (HF). Due to the primary role in the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that enables hair-follicle morphogenesis and hair cycling, DPC has become an attractive cell source for hair regeneration to treat alopecia patients. However, DPCs tend to lose their function during in vitro culture. Hence, there exists a clear need to develop a microenvironment that can recapitulate the interactions within the native milieu of DPCs. Since layer-by-layer (LBL) nano-coating with biocompatible materials on the cell surface displays the versatility with tunable loading and release properties, which can provide a remodeled microenvironment for regulating cell function. Here, we developed a LBL self-assembly technique to single DPCs to create a nano-scale ultrathin extracellular matrix (ECM). We studied that the single cell-based LBL-encapsulation would not impact the viability, morphology, proliferation and intrinsic properties of DPCs using Western blot and mRNA expressions of beta-catenin, ALP and alpha-SMA. We then included fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) into the LBL nano-structure to regulate the DPC function. Finally, we performed in vivo hair reconstitution assays using LBL-encapsulated DPCs combined with freshly isolated epidermal cells (EPCs) and found this strategy can treat hair loss.",hair reconstitution,fibroblast growth factor-2

This study was performed to elucidate the hair growth promoting effects of Polygonum multiflorum extract (PM extract) in cultured human DPCs and its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The effects of PM extract on cultured DPCs were investigated. Cell viability and mitochondrial activity were measured by CCK-8 and JC-1 analysis, respectively. Western blotting, dot blotting, ELISA analysis, immunocytochemistry and real-time PCR analysis were also performed to elucidate the changes in protein and mRNA levels induced by PM extract. 3D cultured DPC spheroids were constructed for mimicking the in vivo DPs. The hair growth stimulatory effect of PM extract was evaluated using human hair follicle organ culture model. RESULTS: PM extract increased the viability and mitochondrial activity in cultured human DPCs in a dose dependent manner. The expression of Bcl2, an anti-apoptotic protein expressed dominantly in anagen was significantly increased and that of BAD, a pro-apoptotic protein expressed in early catagen was decreased by PM extract in cultured DPCs and/or 3D DPC spheroid culture. PM extract also decreased the expression of catagen inducing protein, Dkk-1. Growth factors including IGFBP2, PDGF and VEGF were increased by PM extract, revealed by dot blot protein analysis. We also have found that PM extract could reverse the androgenic effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent androgen.

Gain-of-function mutations in the TRPV3 gene can cause Olmsted syndrome characterized by palmoplantar and periorificial keratoderma, itch, and hair loss. The mechanism underlying the hair loss remains unclear. In this study, we engineered an Olmsted syndrome mouse model by introducing the point mutation G568V to the corresponding Trpv3 locus in the mice. These mice developed fully penetrant hair loss. The hair loss was associated with premature differentiation of follicular keratinocytes characterized by precocious degeneration of trichohyalin and keratins, increased production of deiminated proteins, elevated apoptosis, and attenuation of transcription regulators (Foxn1, Msx2, Dlx3, and Gata3) known to regulate hair follicle differentiation. These abnormalities occurred in the medial-proximal region of the inner root sheath and the hair shaft, where Trpv3 is highly expressed, and correlated with an impaired formation of the hair canal and the hair shaft. The mutant Trpv3 mice also exhibited increased proliferation in the outer root sheath, accelerated hair cycle, reduction of hair follicle stem cells, and miniaturization of regenerated hair follicles.

Quiescent hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) reside in specialized bulge niche where they undergo activation and differentiation upon sensing niche-dependent signals during hair follicle (HF) homeostasis and wound repair. The underlying mechanism of HFSCs and bulge niche maintenance is poorly understood. Our previous study has reported that a transcription factor, forkhead box P1 (Foxp1), functions to maintain the quiescence of HFSCs. Here, we further discovered that forkhead box P4 (Foxp4), a close family member of Foxp1, had similar expression profiles in various components of HFs and formed a complex with Foxp1 in vitro and in vivo. The HF-specific deficiency of Foxp4 resulted in the precocious activation of HFSCs during hair cycles. In contrast to single Foxp1 or Foxp4 conditional knockout (cKO) mice, Foxp1/4 double cKO exerted an additive effect in the spectrum and severity of phenotypes in HFSC activation, hair cycling acceleration and hair loss, coupled with remarkable downregulation of fibroblast growth factor 18 (Fgf18) and bone morphogenetic protein 6 (Bmp6) expression in bulge cells. In addition, the double KO of Foxp1/4 induced the apoptosis of K6-positive (K6+) inner bulge cells, a well-established stem cell (SC) niche, thus resulting in the destruction of the bulge SC niche and recurrent hair loss.

Congenital BFH lesions arranged in a segmental distribution have been described, suggesting they derive from a somatic post-zygotic mutational event. Previously, BFH were described in Happle-Tinschert syndrome, which results from a post-zygotic SMO variant and is characterized by segmental BFH with variable involvement of the teeth, skeleton, and central nervous system. Here, we describe two patients with isolated segmental BFH and no systemic involvement. Paired whole exome sequencing of BFH and normal tissue revealed a pathogenic SMO c.1234 C>T, p.L412F variant restricted to BFH tissue. We characterized the proliferation index and expression of Hedgehog and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway related proteins in segmental BFH compared to sporadic basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and found that segmental BFH had a lower proliferation index. Although segmental BFH expressed a similar level of Gli-1 compared to BCCs, levels of LEF-1 and SOX-9 expression in BFH were weaker for both and patchier for LEF-1.

Doxorubicin, a widely used cancer chemotherapy drug, induces disruption of the hair cycle and subsequent alopecia. We show in this report that doxorubicin causes disruption of the hair-follicle-associated blood vessel network resulting in a greatly reduced density of these blood vessels. Dystrophic hair follicles were also observed with abnormal melanogenesis in the mice treated with doxorubicin. Visualization of the effect of doxorubicin on hair-follicle angiogenesis was made possible by the use of transgenic mice in which green fluorescent protein was driven by regulatory elements of the nestin gene (ND-GFP). In these transgenic mice, the hair-follicle stem cells and the follicle structure as well as the blood vessels associated with the hair follicles express ND-GFP. The hair-follicle stem cells did not appear to be affected by doxorubicin, which may explain why hair regrows after chemotherapy. These results suggest that inhibition of hair-follicle-associated angiogenesis by doxorubicin may be an important factor in hair-follicle dystrophy associated with chemotherapy-induced alopecia.

The homeostasis of both cornea and hair follicles depends on a constant supply of progeny cells produced by populations of keratin (K) 14-expressing stem cells localized in specific niches. To investigate the potential role of Co-factors of LIM domains (Clims) in epithelial tissues, we generated transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative Clim molecule (DN-Clim) under the control of the K14 promoter. As expected, the K14 promoter directed high level expression of the transgene to the basal cells of cornea and epidermis, as well as the outer root sheath of hair follicles. In corneal epithelium, the transgene expression causes decreased expression of adhesion molecule BP180 and defective hemidesmosomes, leading to detachment of corneal epithelium from the underlying stroma, which in turn causes blisters, wounds and an inflammatory response. After a period of epithelial thinning, the corneal epithelium undergoes differentiation to an epidermis-like structure. The K14-DN-Clim mice also develop progressive hair loss due to dysfunctional hair follicles that fail to generate hair shafts. The number of hair follicle stem cells is decreased by at least 60% in K14-DN-Clim mice, indicating that Clims are required for hair follicle stem cell maintenance. In addition, Clim2 interacts with Lhx2 in vivo, suggesting that Clim2 is an essential co-factor for the LIM homeodomain factor Lhx2, which was previously shown to play a role in hair follicle stem cell maintenance.

Here we document that Runx2 has a regulatory role in skin and hair follicle development. The expression of Runx2 is restricted to hair follicles and is dynamic, pari passu with follicle development. Follicle maturation is delayed in the absence of Runx2 and overall skin and epidermal thickness of Runx2 null embryos is significantly reduced. The Runx2 null epidermis is hypoplastic, displaying reduced expression of Keratin 14, Keratin 1 and markers of proliferation. The expression pattern of Runx2 in the bulb epithelium of mature hair follicles is asymmetric and strikingly similar to that of Sonic hedgehog. This suggests that Runx2 may be a regulator of hedgehog signaling in skin as it is in bones and teeth. Supporting this possibility, we demonstrate that Sonic hedgehog, Patched1 and Gli1 transcripts are reduced in the skin of Runx2 null embryos. Moreover, we document Patched1 expression in epidermal basal cells and show that the skin of Sonic(+/-) embryos is thinner than that of wild-type littermates.

Heparanase is a heparan sulphate endo-glycosidase which was previously detected in the outer root sheath of murine hair follicles. Heparanase overexpression was reported to improve mouse hair (re)growth. In this study, we investigated its involvement in human hair biology. Immunofluorescence detection was used to explore heparanase distribution in both anagen and catagen hair follicles. Heparanase functionality was assessed in in vitro cultured hair follicles, in the presence of a heparanase activity inhibitor. Our results showed that heparanase expression was (i) primarily located in the inner root sheath (IRS) of human hair follicle, and there (ii) restricted to anagen phase. Furthermore, inhibition of heparanase in in vitro cultured hair follicles induced a catagen-like process. Hair shaft retreat upward was accompanied by a decrease in Ki67-positive cells, the formation of an epithelial strand as evidenced by K14 keratin expression, and the loss of IRS as assessed by transglutaminase 1 and desmoglein labelling. IRS distribution of heparanase and the induction of catagen-like involution of hair follicles when a potent heparanase inhibitor is added suggest that heparanase is a key actor of IRS differentiation and hair homeostasis.",hair Follicle homeostasis,transglutaminase 1

In adult skin, epithelial hair follicle stem cells (SCs) reside in a quiescent niche and are essential for cyclic bouts of hair growth. Niche architecture becomes pronounced postnatally at the start of the first hair cycle. Whether SCs exist or function earlier is unknown. Here we show that slow-cycling cells appear early in skin development, express SC markers, and later give rise to the adult SC population. To test whether these early slow-cycling cells function as SCs, we use Sox9-Cre for genetic marking and K14-Cre to embryonically ablate Sox9, an essential adult SC gene. We find that the progeny of Sox9-expressing cells contribute to all skin epithelial lineages and Sox9 is required for SC specification. In the absence of early SCs, hair follicle and sebaceous gland morphogenesis is blocked, and epidermal wound repair is compromised. These findings establish the existence of early hair follicle SCs and reveal their physiological importance in tissue morphogenesis.",hair cycle,K14

BACKGROUND: Acceleration of skin regeneration is still an unsolved problem in the clinical treatment of patients suffering from deep burns and scalds. Although erythropoietin (EPO) has a protective role in a wide range of organs and cells during ischemia and after trauma, it has been recently discovered that EPO is not tissue-protective in the common beta subunit receptor (betaCR) knockout mouse. The protective capacity of EPO in tissue is mediated via a heteroreceptor complex comprising both the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and betaCR. However, proof of coexpression of these heterogenic receptors in regenerating skin after burns is still lacking. METHODS: To understand the role of nanosized recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) in wound healing, we investigated the effects of subcutaneous injections of EPO on skin regeneration after deep second-degree scalding injuries. Our aim was to determine if joint expression of EPOR and betaCR is a prerequisite for the tissue-protective effect of rhEPO. The efficiency in wound regeneration in a skin scalding injury mouse model was examined. A deep second-degree dermal scald injury was produced on the backs of 20 female Balb/c mice which were subsequently randomized to four experimental groups, two of which received daily subcutaneous injections of rhEPO. At days 7 and 14, the mice were sacrificed and the effects of rhEPO were analyzed with respect to grade of re-epithelialization (wound closure) and stage of epidermal maturation. This was investigated using different histological parameters of epithelial covering, such as depth of the epidermal layer, epidermal stratification, and presence of conical and hair follicle structures. RESULTS: Expression of EPOR, betaCR, and growth hormone receptor at the mRNA and protein levels was demonstrated with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. After rhEPO treatment, the rate of re-epithelialization of the scalding injury was increased and the time to final wound closure was reduced. In addition, the quality of regenerated skin was improved. In this investigation, for the first time, we demonstrated coexpression of EPOR and betaCR at the RNA and protein levels in vivo using a deep second-degree scalding injury mouse model. These results highlight the potential role of rhEPO in the improved treatment of burns patients, which might be crucial for the development of innovative new therapy regimes.

Active Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the dermal papilla (DP) is required for postnatal hair cycling. In addition, maintenance of the hair-inducing ability of DP cells in vitro requires external addition of Wnt molecules. However, whether DP cells are a critical source of Wnt ligands and induce both autocrine and paracrine signaling cascades to promote adult hair follicle growth and regeneration remains elusive. To address this question, we generated an animal model that allows inducible ablation of Wntless (Wls), a transmembrane Wnt exporter protein, in CD133-positive (CD133+) DP cells. CD133+ cells have been shown to be a specific subpopulation of cells in the DP, which possesses the hair-inducing capability. Here, we show that ablation of Wls expression in CD133+ DP cells results in a shortened period of postnatal hair growth. Mutant hair follicles were unable to enter full anagen (hair growth stage) and progressed toward a rapid regression. Notably, reduced size of the DP and decreased expression of anagen DP marker, versican, were observed in hair follicles when CD133+ DP cells lost Wls expression. Further analysis showed that Wls-deficient CD133+ DP cells led to reduced proliferation and differentiation in matrix keratinocytes and melanocytes that are needed for the generation of the hair follicle structure and a pigmented hair shaft. These findings clearly demonstrate that Wnt ligands produced by CD133+ DP cells play an important role in postnatal hair growth by maintaining the inductivity of DP cells and mediating the signaling cross-talk between the mesenchyme and the epithelial compartment.",hair cycling,CD133

The histomorphometric observation indicated significantly increases the number, shaft of hair follicles and deep subcutis area in the keratin extract treated group in contrast to the control group, which was considered an indication of anagen phase induction. Subsequently, the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that fibroblast growth factor-10, vascular endothelial growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, beta-catenin, and Shh were expressed earlier in the keratin extract-treated group than in the control group. Besides, keratin extract has been observed to be biocompatible when analyzed with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining using immortalized human keratinocyte cells, showing more than 90% cell viability. Our study demonstrated that keratin extract stimulating hair follicle growth by inducing the growth phase; anagen in telogenic C57BL/6 mice and thus the topical application of keratin extract may represent a promising biomaterial for the management and applications of hair follicle disorder.",Hair growth,Shh

BACKGROUND: Body region-dependent hair follicle (HF) characteristics are concerned with follicular size and distribution, and have been demonstrated to have characteristics for each region of the body. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression patterns of the markers called cytokeratin 15 (K15), cytokeratin 6 (K6) and monoclonal antibody Ki-67, and also apoptosis in HFs, which can be observed in different parts of the human body. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, healthy human HFs were taken by biopsy from 5 various donor sites of the human body: the scalp, the leg, the abdomen, the back and waist. HF-containing skin specimens taken using cryosection were stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and K15, K6, Ki-67 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dNTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) immunofluorescence staining protocol was performed. RESULTS: Different skin regions from the human body were examined histologically. While the HFs of scalp tissue showed anatomically obvious hair layers, some hair sections from other regions, like the leg, the abdomen, back and waist, were not as distinct as in the scalp region. According to our findings, K15 expression was highest in the scalp. In addition, the immunoreactivity (IR) intensity of K15 was significantly decreased in the HFs on the waist and abdominal regions, compared to the scalp and back regions (p < 0.001). However, the IR intensity of K6 in the scalp region was statistically significantly higher than the IR intensity of K6 in the abdomen region (p < 0.05). Moreover, we showed intraepithelial apoptosis and proliferation of keratinocytes in the bulge of HF. In the study, Ki-67-positive and TUNEL-positive cell numbers were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are important for further investigation of molecular aspects of the human hair follicle stem cells compartments in health and disease, which might be a promising model for comparative studies with different human diseases.",hair Follicle stem cells,cytokeratin 15

Activins and their receptors play important roles in the control of hair follicle morphogenesis, but their role in vibrissae follicle growth remains unclear. To investigate the effect of Activin B on vibrissae follicles, the anagen induction assay and an in vitro vibrissae culture system were constructed. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed to determine the hair cycle stages. The 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays were used to examine the cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle phase. Inhibitors and Western blot analysis were used to investigate the signaling pathway induced by Activin B. As a result, we found that the vibrissae follicle growth was accelerated by 10 ng/mL Activin B in the anagen induction assay and in an organ culture model. 10 ng/mL Activin B promoted hair matrix cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, Activin B modulates hair matrix cell growth through the ERK-Elk1 signaling pathway, and Activin B accelerates hair matrix cell transition from the G1/G0 phase to the S phase through the ERK-Cyclin D1 signaling pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Activin B may promote mouse vibrissae growth by stimulating hair matrix cell proliferation and cell cycle progression through ERK signaling.",hair cycle,Cyclin D1

OBJECTIVES: Recognizing the central role of Wnt signalling in hair biology, the aim was to delineate the differential expression of key agonists, antagonists and target genes of this pathway during the telogen-to-anagen transformation of human scalp HFs. METHODS: This differential expression was studied by in situ hybridization in human telogen and early-anagen scalp HF sections. RESULTS: On anagen induction, gene expression of the Wnt ligands WNT3, WNT4 and WNT10B, the Wnt ligand secretion regulator WLS, and the Wnt target genes AXIN2 and LEF1, is significantly increased within the secondary hair germ and the dermal papilla. Conversely, expression of the secreted Wnt inhibitor SFRP1 (secreted frizzled-related protein 1) is reduced. Human epithelial HF stem cells upregulate WNT4 and WNT10A expression, suggesting that these Wnt agonists are important for stem cell activation.

Here, we identify a small transdermally deliverable 5-mer peptide (GLYYF; P5) that activates adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and promotes hair growth. P5 sufficiently reproduces the biological effect of adiponectin protein via AMPK signaling pathway, increasing the expression of hair growth factors in the dermal papilla cells of human hair follicle. P5 accelerates hair growth ex vivo and induces anagen hair cycle in mice in vivo. Furthermore, we elucidate a key spot for the binding between AdipoR1 and adiponectin protein using docking simulation and mutagenesis studies. This study suggests that P5 could be used as a topical peptide drug for alleviating pathological conditions, which can be improved by adiponectin protein, such as alopecia.",hair growth,AdipoR1
266,16537021,17311,F000008,1,"Biological characterization of cultured dermal papilla cells and hair follicle regeneration in vitro and in vivo. BACKGROUND: Dermal papilla cells (DPC) are a group of mesenchyme-derived cells at the base of the hair follicle, where they regulate and control hair follicle growth through the expression and secretion of cytokines. Nevertheless, the role of DPC derived chemokines and other cytokines in the hair follicle biology remain speculative. In this study, we investigated the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and stem cell factor (SCF) in different passages of cultured DPC and their effects on the biological behaviour of DPC. METHODS: The expression of bFGF, ET-1 and SCF in different passages of cultured DPC and their possible effects on the biological behavior of DPC are investigated using in situ hybridization and immunochemistry. In addition, we performed transplantation of hair follicle cells into nude mice. The cultured DPC, dermal sheath cells and fibroblast of human scalp, respectively, were mixed with cells of the hair follicle epithelium in different ratios, and then were cultured in hair follicle organotypic cultures or implanted into the subcutis of nude mice. RESULTS: The expression of ET-1 and SCF in early passages of cultured DPC became stronger, but turned weaker and even negative in late passages (> 6 passages). Hair follicle-like structures were formed after DPC combined with the cells of hair follicle epithelium cells in hair follicle organotypic cultures. When hair follicle organotypic cultures were implanted into the subcutis of nude mice, the relative intact hair follicles were formed. After the transplantation of hair follicle cells into the nude mice, the hair follicle-like structure was formed in the group that contained DPC mixed with hair follicle epithelium cells. However, no hair follicles were formed in the other two groups. It was found that the higher the expression of ET-1 and SCF in DPC, the stronger the ability of DPC to induce hair follicle regeneration.

To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of embryonic HF fate determination during epidermal development/differentiation, we analyzed conditional mutant mice with keratinocytes expressing constitutively active beta-catenin (K5-Cre Catnb(ex3)fl/+). The mutant mice developed scaly skin with a thickened epidermis and showed impaired epidermal stratification. The hair shaft keratins were broadly expressed in the epidermis but there was no expression of the terminal differentiation markers K1 and loricrin. Hair placode markers (Bmp2 and Shh) and follicular dermal condensate markers (noggin, patched 1 and Pdgfra) were expressed throughout the epidermis and the upper dermis, respectively. These results indicate that the embryonic epidermal keratinocytes have switched extensively to the HF fate. A series of genetic studies demonstrated that the epidermal switching to HF fate was suppressed by introducing the conditional mutation K5-Cre Catnb(ex3)fl/+Shhfl/- (with additional mutation of Shh signaling) or K5-Cre Catnb(ex3)fl/+BmprIAfl/fl (with additional mutation of Bmp signaling). These results demonstrate that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling relayed through Shh and Bmp signals is the principal regulatory mechanism underlying the HF cell fate change. Assessment of Bmp2 promoter activities suggested a putative regulation by beta-catenin signaling relayed by Shh signaling towards Bmp2. We also found that Shh protein expression was increased and expanded in the epidermis of K5-Cre Catnb(ex3)fl/+BmprIAfl/fl mice.

BACKGROUND: Hair follicle (HF) ostia represent a potential port of microbial entry into the skin. However, they rarely show clinical signs of infection. This suggests the presence of local, efficient, antimicrobial defence systems, which may include antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). OBJECTIVES: We determined the presence and distribution of the major AMPs, RNase 7 and psoriasin (S100A7), in human scalp HFs. We investigated whether HF production of these AMPs was induced by prototypic microbial products and proinflammatory cytokines, i.e. interferon (IFN)-gamma. Finally, we examined whether the classical pathways for AMP induction, such as toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and TLR5 expression, are present in human HFs and up-regulated after stimulation with bacterium-associated ligands. METHODS: Cryosections from fresh or organ-cultured full-thickness normal human scalp skin treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagellin, protein A, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) or IFN-gamma were stained for psoriasin and RNase 7 immunoreactivity (IR) as well as for TLR4 and TLR5. In addition, outer root sheath cell culture and semiquantitative analysis of mRNA expression levels of RNase 7 and psoriasin were performed. RESULTS: Specific RNase 7 IR was present throughout the entire HF outer root sheath in situ and in cell culture, whereas psoriasin IR was present only in the most distal compartment and not detectable in cultured ORS cells. Upon treatment with Gram-positive (LTA, protein A) or Gram-negative bacterial (LPS, flagellin) cell wall components, or with the cytokine IFN-gamma, the IR of both psoriasin and RNase 7 was modified. TLR4 and TLR5 IR was detected in the normal HF epithelium and were upregulated after treatment with their respective ligand. The mRNA analysis confirmed the immunohistochemistry results. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that normal human scalp HF epithelium possesses a functional antimicrobial defence system, which includes the AMPs RNase 7 and psoriasin, and TLRs, and that these are induced by classical microbial products.",HF outer root sheath,RNase 7

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family proteins act downstream of these GTPases, controlling actin assembly and cytoskeletal reorganization, but their role in epithelial cells has not been characterized in vivo. Here, we used a conditional knockout approach to assess the role of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), the ubiquitously expressed Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-like (WASL) protein, in mouse skin. We found that N-WASP deficiency in mouse skin led to severe alopecia, epidermal hyperproliferation, and ulceration, without obvious effects on epidermal differentiation and wound healing.

Amelogenin, an enamel matrix protein has been considered to be exclusively expressed by ameloblasts during odontogenesis. However, burgeoning evidence indicates that amelogenin is also expressed in non-mineralizing tissues. Under the hypothesis that amelogenin may be a functional molecule in developing hair follicles which share developmental features with odontogenesis, this study for the first time elucidated the presence and functional changes of amelogenin and its receptors during rat hair follicle development. Amelogenin was specifically localized in the outer epithelial root sheath of hair follicles. Its expression appeared in the deeper portion of hair follicles, i.e. the bulbar and suprabulbar regions rather than the superficial region. Lamp-1, an amelogenin receptor, was localized in either follicular cells or outer epithelial sheath cells, reflecting functional changes during development. The expression of amelogenin splicing variants increased in a time-dependent manner during postnatal development of hair follicles. Amelogenin expression was increased by treatment with cyclosporin A, which is an inducer of anagen in the hair follicle, whereas the level of Lamp-1 and -2 was decreased by cyclosporin A treatment.

The hair growth effect of FFO extract was evaluated by the culture method of vibrissa follicles and in vivo dotmatrix planimetry method. FFO extract increased the length of hair-fibers and enabled stimulated initiation into the anagen phase of the hair cycle. As expected, FFO extract significantly increased DPC proliferation. FFO extract induced the progression of the cell cycle and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 and Akt. FFO extract induced nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, a stimulator of anagen phase, through an increase of phospho-glycogen synthase kinase3beta (GSK3beta) level. Since various prostaglandins are known to promote hair growth in humans and mice, we examined the effect of DHA, a main omega-3 fatty acid of FFO, on DPC proliferation. DHA not only increased DPC proliferation but also upregulated levels of cell cycle-associated proteins such as cyclin D1 and cdc2 p34.

Plantar skin retains all of the mechanistic components needed for hair follicle development, as genetic deletion of Dkk2 permits formation of fully functional plantar hair follicles that give rise to external hair, contain sebaceous glands and a stem cell compartment, and undergo regenerative growth. In the absence of Dkk2, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activity is initially broadly elevated in embryonic plantar skin and gradually becomes patterned, mimicking follicular development in normally haired areas.

The study was performed on skin samples collected at different periods of HF cycle and the molecular expression of PDGFA, BMP2 and LHX2 was evaluated by Real-Time PCR (qPCR) at each time point. Since PDGFA showed the most variation, the goat PDGFA gene was sequenced and the protein localization was investigated by immunohistochemistry together with PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha). PDGFA immunostaining was observed in the basal layer of the HF outer root sheath and the immunoreaction appeared stronger in the regressive HFs compared to those in the anagen phase according to qPCR analysis. PDGFRalpha was observed in the HF epithelium, proving the effect of PDGFA on the follicular structure. The data obtained suggest that PDGFA and BMP2 are both implicated in HF cycle in goat. In particular, PDGFA secreted by the HF is involved in the anagen activation.",HF epithelium,PDGFA

Hair follicle reconstitution requires highly organized epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Skin equivalents containing the epidermal and dermal cells with hair reconstitution capacity can reproduce these processes, but have not been established. This study was conducted to develop a hair follicle-producing three-dimensional (3D) skin equivalent assay using neonate mouse epidermal and dermal cells. A skin equivalent comprised of mouse dermal cells (MDCs) embedded in type I collagen and overlaid with mouse epidermal cells (MECs) was used. MDCs were mixed with type I collagen and cultured for 7 days. One day after adding MECs on top, the composites were grafted onto nude mice. MDCs cultured on a two-dimensional (2D) plate for 7 days and mixed with MECs as a negative control, and freshly isolated MDCs and MECs mixture (chamber assay) as a positive control were also grafted. Six weeks after grafting, regenerated hair follicles were analysed. Our 3D skin equivalent culture assay reproducibly regenerated hair follicles, while MDCs precultured in the 2D model with MECs did not. Compared to the chamber assay, which produced randomly oriented hair follicles, nearly all regenerated hair follicles in our assay extruded through the skin and numerous regenerated hair follicles were higher than those in the chamber assay. Several representative genes associated with hair induction showed higher expression in our assay than in the 2D model. When Wnt3a was added, the number of regenerated hairs increased. Organized hair follicle regeneration was accomplished using our assay. This approach can be applied to assess a test agent with hair growth-promoting effects.",dermal cells,Wnt3a

The hair follicle is a complex structure that goes through a cyclic period of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen) under the regulation of several signaling pathways, including Wnt/ beta-catenin, FGF, Shh, and Notch. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is specifically involved in hair follicle morphogenesis, regeneration, and growth. beta-catenin is expressed in the dermal papilla and promotes anagen induction and duration, as well as keratinocyte regulation and differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated the activation of beta-catenin by a polyphenolic compound 3,4,5-tri-O-caffeoylquinic acid (TCQA) in mice model and in human dermal papilla cells to promote hair growth cycle. A complete regrowth of the shaved area of C3H mice was observed upon treatment with TCQA. Global gene expression analysis using microarray showed an upregulation in hair growth-associated genes. Moreover, the expression of beta-catenin was remarkably upregulated in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest that beta-catenin activation by TCQA promoted the initiation of the anagen phase of the hair cycle.",hair cycle,Shh

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy has been considered as a promising treatment for androgenetic alopecia (AGA). The aim of the study was comparative evaluation of the clinical efficacy of PRP-therapy, minoxidil, and their combination in the treatment of men with AGA and to evaluate the effects of PRP on the proliferation of hair follicle (HF) cells in skin biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 69 men who were divided into 3 groups who received PRP therapy, minoxidil, and their combination. The clinical efficacy of the therapy was evaluated by the dynamics of morphometric of hairs. To assess cell proliferation antibodies to beta-catenin, CD34, Ki67, and to Dkk-1 were used. RESULTS: PRP treatment was more effective than minoxidil therapy (p = 0.005). Complex therapy turned out to be more effective than minoxidil monotherapy (p < 0.0001) and PRP monotherapy (p = 0.007). After applying PRP the absolute and relative values of the beta-catenin and CD34 expression area increased; an increase in Ki67+ index was also significant.

In this study, we used a novel plant nanoparticle of safflower oil body (SOB) loaded with human fibroblast growth factor 10 (hFGF10) to target hair follicles and accelerate hair regeneration in AGA mice with few adverse effects. Our data revealed that the average particle size of SOB-hFGF10 was 226.73 +- 9.98 nm, with a spherical and uniform structure, and that SOB-hFGF10 was quicker to preferentially penetrate into hair follicles than hFGF2 alone. Using a mouse model of AGA, SOB-hFGF10 was found to significantly improve hair regeneration without any significant toxicity. Furthermore, SOB-hFGF10 inhibited dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 overproduction in macrophages in relation to hair follicle microinflammation, thereby enhancing the proliferation of dermal papilla cells.

BACKGROUND: Finasteride and minoxidil are two commonly used drugs for the treatment of hair loss. However, these two drugs have certain side effects. Thus, the further elucidation of treatments for hair loss, including those using Chinese herbal medicine, remains important clinically. Shi-Bi-Man (SBM) is a hair health supplement that darkens hair and contains ginseng radix, tea polyphenols, polygonum multiflorum, radix angelicae sinensis, aloe, linseed, and green tea extract. PURPOSE: This study aimed to find potential effective monomer components to promote hair regeneration from SBM and to explore the mechanism of SBM to promote hair regeneration. METHODS: Supplementation with the intragastric administration or smear administration of SBM in artificially shaved C57BL/6 mice, observe its hair growth. UPLC/MS and UPLC/LTQ-Orbitrap-MS detect the main components in SBM and the main monomers contained in the skin after smearing, respectively. A network pharmacology study on the main components of SBM and single-cell RNA sequencing was performed to explore the role of SBM for hair regeneration. RESULTS: SBM significantly induced hair growth compared with a control treatment. TSG and EGCG were the main monomers in the skin after SBM smearing. The results of single-cell sequencing revealed that after SBM treatment, the number of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and dermal papilla cells (DPCs) increased significantly. Cell interactions and volcano dots show that the interaction of the FGF signaling pathway was significantly enhanced, in which Fgf7 expression was especially upregulated in DPCs. In addition, the Wnt signaling pathway also had a partially enhanced effect on the interactions between various cells in the skin. The network pharmacology study showed that the promotion of the FGF and Wnt pathways by SBM was also enriched in alopecia diseases. CONCLUSION: We report that SBM has a potential effect on the promotion of hair growth by mainly activating the FGF signaling pathway.

In the case of hair growth, several members of the FGF family, such as FGF1 and FGF2, are involved in hair growth, while FGF5 has the opposite effect. In this study, the regulation of the hair growth cycle by FGF12 was investigated. To observe its effect, the expression of FGF12 was downregulated in mice and outer root sheath (ORS) by siRNA transfection, while FGF12 overexpression was carried out using FGF12 adenovirus. For the results, FGF12 was primarily expressed in ORS cells with a high expression during the anagen phase of hair follicles. Knockdown of FGF12 delayed telogen-to-anagen transition in mice and decreased the hair length in vibrissae hair follicles. It also inhibited the proliferation and migration of ORS cells. On the contrary, FGF12 overexpression increased the migration of ORS cells. FGF12-overexpressed ORS cells induced the telogen-to-anagen transition in the animal model. In addition, FGF12 overexpression regulated the expression of PDGF-CC, MDK, and HB-EGF, and treatment of these factors exhibited hair growth promotion.

It is increasingly evident that the molecular mechanisms underlying hair follicle differentiation and cycling recapitulate principles of embryonic patterning and organ regeneration. Here we used Hoxc13-overexpressing transgenic mice (also known as GC13 mice), known to develop severe hair growth defects and alopecia, as a tool for defining pathways of hair follicle differentiation. Gene array analysis performed with RNA from postnatal skin revealed differential expression of distinct subsets of genes specific for cells of the three major hair shaft compartments (cuticle, cortex, and medulla) and their precursors. This finding correlates well with the structural defects observed in each of these compartments and implicates Hoxc13 in diverse pathways of hair follicle differentiation. The group of medulla-specific genes was particularly intriguing because this included the developmentally regulated transcription factor-encoding gene Foxq1 that is altered in the medulladefective satin mouse hair mutant. We provide evidence that Foxq1 is a downstream target for Hoxc13 based on DNA binding studies as well as co-transfection and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Expression of additional medulla-specific genes down-regulated upon overexpression of Hoxc13 requires functional Foxq1 as their expression is ablated in hair follicles of satin mice. Combined, these results demonstrate that Hoxc13 and Foxq1 control medulla differentiation through a common regulatory pathway.

The Wnt and Notch signalling pathways regulate hair follicle maintenance, but how they intersect is unknown. We show that Notch signalling is active in the hair follicle pre-cortex, a region of high Wnt activity, where commitment to hair lineages occurs. Deletion of jagged 1 (Jag1) results in inhibition of the hair growth cycle and conversion of hair follicles into cysts of cells undergoing interfollicular epidermal differentiation. Conversely, activation of Notch in adult epidermis triggers expansion of the base of the hair follicle, sebaceous gland enlargement and abnormal clumping of the follicles. In adult epidermis, the induction of new hair follicle formation by beta-catenin is prevented by blocking Notch signalling pharmacologically or through Jag1 deletion. Conversely, activation of both pathways accelerates growth and differentiation of ectopic follicles. beta-catenin stimulates Notch signalling by inducing Jag1 transcription.

Moreover, the potency of proliferation was maintained during serial cultivations (more than 30 passages). We combined these established DP cells with epidermal cells and implanted them subcutaneously into athymic mice to examine their hair follicle-inducing ability. New hair follicles were induced by dissociated DP cells at earlier passages (under passage 4), but the cells from later passages could not induce follicles. We next aggregated the DP cells to form spheres and then injected them with epidermal cells. Unlike the dissociated DP cells, the spheres made from the later passaged cells (more than 10 passages) did induce new hair follicles. We examined several genes specific for DP of anagen follicles and confirmed that their expression level was elevated in the spheres compared with their expression level in adherent DP cells. These results suggest that FGF-2 is essential for dermal papilla cell culture and that sphere formation partially models the intact DP, resulting in hair follicle induction, even by later passaged cells.",dermal papilla cells,fibroblast growth factor-2

The underlying molecular pathogenesis in humans is virtually unknown because of the lack of adequate research models. Therefore, we have explored whether microdissected, organ-cultured, human scalp hair follicles (HFs) in anagen VI can be exploited for dissecting and manipulating the impact of chemotherapy on human HFs. Here, we show that these organ-cultured HFs respond to a key cyclophosphamide metabolite, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), in a manner that resembles chemotherapy-induced HF dystrophy as it occurs in vivo: namely, 4-HC induced melanin clumping and melanin incontinence, down-regulated keratinocyte proliferation, massively up-regulated apoptosis of hair matrix keratinocytes, prematurely induced catagen, and up-regulated p53. In addition, 4-HC induced DNA oxidation and the mitochondrial DNA common deletion.

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is key for cell survival, migration, and adhesion, but little is known about its role in epidermal development and homeostasis in vivo. We generated mice with conditional inactivation of the Ilk gene in squamous epithelia. These mice die perinatally and exhibit skin blistering and severe defects in hair follicle morphogenesis, including greatly reduced follicle numbers, failure to progress beyond very early developmental stages, and pronounced defects in follicular keratinocyte proliferation. ILK-deficient epidermis shows abnormalities in adhesion to the basement membrane and in differentiation. ILK-deficient cultured keratinocytes fail to attach and spread efficiently and exhibit multiple abnormalities in actin cytoskeletal organization. Ilk gene inactivation in cultured keratinocytes causes impaired ability to form stable lamellipodia, to directionally migrate, and to polarize. These defects are accompanied by abnormal distribution of active Cdc42 to cell protrusions, as well as reduced activation of Rac1 upon induction of cell migration in scraped keratinocyte monolayers.

Histologically, it is very important not to find cartilage or a central epithelial lined cystic structure for distinction from an accessory auricle and from a trichofolliculoma, respectively.

Several types of adult stem cells are capable of transdifferentiaton into other types of tissues. The hair follicle bulge area is an abundant and easily accessible source of pluripotent adult stem cells. We demonstrate that the bulge KSCs have the potential for transdifferentiation into corneal epithelial-like cells. Bulge KSCs isolated by collagen type IV adhesiveness possessed the highest colony formation efficiency (CFE), and expressed specific markers (CD34 and alpha6-integrin). The isolated cells transdifferentiate into corneal epithelial-like cells in conditioned medium containing corneal limbus soluble factors, including their specific marker, keratin12. The transdifferentiation depends on upregulation of pax6 and downregulation of beta-catenin and Lef-1. Furthermore, overexpression of pax6 in bulge KSCs induced their expression of k12. The expressions of beta-catenin and Lef-1 were not suppressed in the pax6-transfected bulge KSCs, but which were downregulated pax6-transfected cells cultured in the conditioned medium.

BACKGROUND: Keratin family proteins are generally accepted as being restricted to epithelial cells. However, several studies have challenged this paradigm by reporting, for example, that melanoma cells can express keratins and that normal human epidermal melanocytes, which derive from the neural crest, express keratin 16 (K16) in situ. OBJECTIVES: We wished to confirm or refute that K16 and/or its intermediate filament partner, keratin 6 (K6), are expressed in normal human epidermal and/or hair follicle melanocytes in situ. METHODS: Cryosections of normal human scalp skin were subjected to highly sensitive double immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies against K16 or K6 and against the melanocyte-specific marker NKI/beteb (gp100). Immunoreactivity (IR) was visualized by conventional light microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Despite the use of different, high-sensitivity immunostaining methods, stringent positive and negative controls, and monospecific, well-characterized antikeratin antibodies, we could detect neither K16 nor K6 IR within intraepidermal or intrafollicular pigment cells of normal human scalp skin. Instead, NKI/beteb+ cells were found to be intimately embedded in foci of K16+ and/or K6+ keratinocytes, which might create the illusion of keratin expression by these cells. CONCLUSIONS: Human epidermal or hair follicle melanocytes do not express K16 and/or K6 while residing in their natural habitat.",hair Follicle melanocytes,keratin 16

335,22661232,6469,F000034,1,"Shh maintains dermal papilla identity and hair morphogenesis via a Noggin-Shh regulatory loop. During hair follicle morphogenesis, dermal papillae (DPs) function as mesenchymal signaling centers that cross-talk with overlying epithelium to regulate morphogenesis. While the DP regulates hair follicle formation, relatively little is known about the molecular basis of DP formation. The morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is known for regulating hair follicle epithelial growth, with excessive signaling resulting in basal cell carcinomas. Here, we investigate how dermal-specific Shh signaling contributes to DP formation and hair growth. Using a Cre-lox genetic model and RNAi in hair follicle reconstitution assays, we demonstrate that dermal Smoothened (Smo) loss of function results in the loss of the DP precursor, the dermal condensate, and a stage 2 hair follicle arrest phenotype reminiscent of Shh(-/-) skin. Surprisingly, dermal Smo does not regulate cell survival or epithelial proliferation. Rather, molecular screening and immunostaining studies reveal that dermal Shh signaling controls the expression of a subset of DP-specific signature genes. Using a hairpin/cDNA lentiviral system, we show that overexpression of the Shh-dependent gene Noggin, but not Sox2 or Sox18, can partially rescue the dermal Smo knockdown hair follicle phenotype by increasing the expression of epithelial Shh. Our findings suggest that dermal Shh signaling regulates specific DP signatures to maintain DP maturation while maintaining a reciprocal Shh-Noggin signaling loop to drive hair follicle morphogenesis.",dermal papilla,Shh

Dermal Papillae (DP) is a unique population of mesenchymal cells that was shown to regulate hair follicle formation and growth cycle. During development most DP cells are derived from mesoderm, however, functionally equivalent DP cells of cephalic hairs originate from Neural Crest (NC). Here we directed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to generate first NC cells and then hair-inducing DP-like cells in culture. We showed that hESC-derived DP-like cells (hESC-DPs) express markers typically found in adult human DP cells (e.g., p-75, nestin, versican, SMA, alkaline phosphatase) and are able to induce hair follicle formation when transplanted under the skin of immunodeficient NUDE mice. Engineered to express GFP, hESC-derived DP-like cells incorporate into DP of newly formed hair follicles and express appropriate markers. We demonstrated that BMP signaling is critical for hESC-DP derivation since BMP inhibitor dorsomorphin completely eliminated hair-inducing activity from hESC-DP cultures. DP cells were proposed as the cell-based treatment for hair loss diseases. Unfortunately human DP cells are not suitable for this purpose because they cannot be obtained in necessary amounts and rapidly loose their ability to induce hair follicle formation when cultured. In this context derivation of functional hESC-DP cells capable of inducing a robust hair growth for the first time shown here can become an important finding for the biomedical science.",hair growth,versican

Alopecia is divided into two categories: androgenic alopecia and nonandrogenic alopecia. An androgen-dependent abnormality of biological functions causes alopecia in males, but the role of androgens is not yet elucidated in female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Modulation of androgenic activity is not effective in certain kinds of androgenic alopecia in females, as well as in cases of nonandrogenic alopecia in males and females. The hair growth drug, minoxidil, stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production as well as vascularization and hair growth in females. Yet, because minoxidil has side effects with long-term use, a safe alternative hair growth agent is needed. Whereas hair develops after birth in mammalian species, hair mostly grows in a precocial bird, in the chicken, between hatching days 14 and 15. Therefore, we hypothesized that the chicken egg contains a key hair growth factor. In this study, we demonstrated that water-soluble peptides derived from the egg yolk stimulate VEGF production and human hair follicle dermal papilla cell growth. We also found that these peptides enhance murine hair growth and improve hair growth in FPHL. Finally, we characterized that water-soluble egg yolk peptides induce VEGF expression through insulin growth factor-1 receptor activation-induced hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha transcription pathway.

OBJECTIVE: Hair greying (i.e., canities) is a component of chronological ageing and occurs regardless of gender or ethnicity. Canities is directly linked to the loss of melanin and increase in oxidative stress in the hair follicle and shaft. To promote hair pigmentation and reduce the hair greying process, an agonist of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), a biomimetic peptide (palmitoyl tetrapeptide-20; PTP20) was developed. The aim of this study was to describe the effects of the designed peptide on hair greying. METHODS: Effect of the PTP20 on the enzymatic activity of catalase and the production of H2 O2 by Human Follicle Dermal Papilla Cells (HFDPC) was evaluated. Influence of PTP20 on the expression of melanocortin receptor-1 (MC1-R) and the production of melanin were investigated. Enzymatic activity of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) after treatment with PTP20 was also determined. Ex vivo studies using human micro-dissected hairs allowed to visualize the effect of PTP20 on the expression in hair follicle of catalase, TRP-1, TRP-2, Melan-A, ASIP, and MC1-R. These investigations were completed by a clinical study on 15 human male volunteers suffering from premature canities. RESULTS: The in vitro and ex vivo studies revealed the capacity of the examined PTP20 peptide to enhance the expression of catalase and to decrease (30%) the intracellular level of H2 O2 . Moreover, PTP20 was shown to activate in vitro and ex vivo the melanogenesis process. In fact, an increase in the production of melanin was shown to be correlated with elevated expression of MC1-R, TRP-1, and Melan-A, and with the reduction in ASIP expression. A modulation on TRP-2 was also observed. The pivotal role of MC1-R was confirmed on protein expression analysed on volunteer's plucked hairs after 3 months of the daily application of lotion containing 10 ppm of PTP20 peptide.

The expression signature of key genes controlling hair growth and cycling, apoptosis, inflammation, and senescence was assessed for (1) chilled versus room temperature (RT) and (2) DP cell medium, saline, Hypothermosol, platelet-rich plasma, and ATPv-supplemented saline. RESULTS: The authors found chilled versus RT to prevent inflammatory cytokine signaling. Under chilled conditions, ATPv-supplemented saline was the best condition to preserve the expression of the trichogenic genes HEY1 and LEF1. CONCLUSION: Data disclose DP gene expression analysis as a useful methodology to ascertain the efficacy of preserving solutions and elucidate about the best currently available option for FUE clinical practice.",HF cells,HEY1

Exos derived from 3D DP (3D DP-Exos) promoted the proliferation of DP cells and outer root sheath (ORS) cells and increased the expression of growth factors (IGF-1, KGF and HGF) in DP cells. 3D DP-Exo treatment also increased hair shaft elongation in cultured human hair follicles. In addition, local injections of 3D DP-Exos induced anagen from telogen and also prolonged anagen in mice. Moreover, Exo treatment in human DP spheres augmented hair follicle neogenesis when the DP spheres were implanted with mouse epidermal cells. Similar results were obtained using Exos derived from 2D-cultured DP cells (2D DP-Exo).

SHED and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) (n = 3) were cultured in media combinations; i) STK2, ii) DMEM-KO+10% FBS, iii) STK2+2% FBS and profiled for the presence of positive hair growth-regulatory paracrine factors; SDF-1, HGF, VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and negative hair growth-regulatory paracrine factors; IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, TGF-beta, bFGF, TNF-alpha, and BDNF. The potential of CM from both cell sources to stimulate hair growth was evaluated based on the paracrine profile and measured dynamics of hair growth under in vitro conditions. The administration of CM media to telogen-staged synchronized 7-week old C3H/HeN female mice was carried out to study the potential of the CM to stimulate hair growth in vivo. SHED and HFSCs cultured in STK2 based media showed a shorter population doubling time, higher viability and better maintenance of MSC characteristics in comparison to cells cultured in DMEM-KO media. STK2 based CM contained only two negative hair growth-regulatory factors; TNF-alpha, IL-1 while DMEM-KO CM contained all negative hair growth-regulatory factors. The in vitro study confirmed that treatment with STK2 based media CM from passage 3 SHED and HFSCs resulted in a significantly higher number of anagen-staged hair follicles (p<0.05) and a significantly lower number of telogen-staged hair follicles (p<0.05). Administration of SHED-CM to C3H/HeN mice resulted in a significantly faster stimulation of hair growth in comparison to HFSC-CM (p<0.05), while the duration taken for complete hair coverage was similar for both CM sources.

BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma has shown some promise in the treatment of alopecia areata. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of platelet-rich plasma on hair regrowth and lesional T-cell cytokine expression in alopecia areata. METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, split-head study involving 27 patients with alopecia areata (Severity of Alopecia Tool score >=25%). Alopecia patches on either side of the scalp were randomized to receive 3 intradermal injections of platelet-rich plasma or normal saline at monthly intervals and evaluated 3 months after the last session. Lesional T-cell cytokine messenger RNA expression was compared pre- and posttreatment in the platelet-rich plasma-treated sites. RESULTS: The mean Severity of Alopecia Tool score did not change significantly compared with baseline with either platelet-rich plasma or placebo injections at any visit; however, the mean percentage reduction in the score in the platelet-rich plasma arm was more than in the placebo arm (9.05% +- 36.48% vs 4.99% +- 33.88%; P = .049) at final assessment. The mean interferon gamma (P = .001) and interleukin 17 cytokine (P = .009) messenger RNA expression decreased, whereas the mean interleukin 10 (P = .049) and FOXP3 (P = .011) messenger RNA expression increased significantly after platelet-rich plasma treatment. LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and a relatively short follow-up. CONCLUSION: Platelet-rich plasma was found to have limited efficacy in alopecia areata.

Therefore, we investigated how perifollicular adipocytes affect the physiology of human anagen scalp HFs. Quantitative immunohistomorphometry, X-ray microcomputed tomography, and transmission electron microscopy showed that the number and size of perifollicular adipocytes declined during anagen-catagen transition, whereas fluorescence-lifetime imaging revealed increased lipid oxidation in adipocytes surrounding the bulge and/or sub-bulge region. Ex vivo, dWAT tendentially promoted hair shaft production, and significantly stimulated hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation and HF pigmentation. Both dWAT pericytes and PREF1/DLK1+ adipocyte progenitors secreted HGF during human HF-dWAT co-culture, for which the c-Met receptor was expressed in the hair matrix and dermal papilla. These effects were reproduced using recombinant HGF and abrogated by an HGF-neutralizing antibody. Laser-capture microdissection-based microarray analysis of the hair matrix showed that dWAT-derived HGF upregulated keratin (K) genes (K27, K73, K75, K84, K86) and TCHH. Mechanistically, HGF stimulated Wnt/beta-catenin activity in the human hair matrix (increased AXIN2, LEF1) by upregulating WNT6 and WNT10B, and inhibiting SFRP1 in the dermal papilla.

Hair loss, including alopecia, is a common and distressing problem for men and women, and as a result, there is considerable interest in developing treatments that can prevent or reverse hair loss. Dermal papillae closely interact with epidermal cells and play a key role during hair follicle induction and hair morphogenesis. As dermal papilla cells (DPCs) lose their hair-inducing ability in monolayer cultures in vitro, it is difficult to obtain de novo hair follicle structures following DPC transplantation in vivo. The present study aimed to explore culture conditions to maintain DPC characteristics using conditioned media (CM) from the supernatant of cultured HaCaT keratinocyte cells supplemented with other components. Initially, it was observed that during passaging of in vitro monolayer DPC cultures, the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was repressed, while the TGF-beta/Smad pathway was activated, and that HaCaT cells cultivated in 1% fetal bovine serum had higher levels of expression of Wnt3a and Wnt10b compared with normal keratinocytes.

FGF5 is overexpressed during the late anagen phase and serves as a crucial regulatory factor that promotes the anagen-to-catagen transition in the hair follicle cycle. FGF18, which is overexpressed during the telogen phase, mainly regulates the hair follicle cycle by maintaining the telogen phase and inhibiting the entry of hair follicles into the anagen phase. The inhibition of FGF5 may prolong the anagen phase, whereas the inhibition of FGF18 may promote the transition of the hair follicles from the telogen phase to the anagen phase. In the present study, we used siRNA to suppress FGF5 or FGF18 expression as a way to inhibit the activity of these genes. Using qPCR, we showed that FGF5-targeting siRNA modified by cholesterol was more effective than the same siRNA bound to a cell-penetrating peptide at suppressing the expression of FGF5 both in vitro and in vivo. We then investigated the effects of the cholesterol-modified siRNA targeting either FGF5 or FGF18 on the hair follicle cycle in a depilated area of the skin on the back of mice. The cholesterol-modified siRNA, delivered by intradermal injection, effectively regulated the hair follicle cycle by inhibiting the expression of FGF5 and FGF18. More specifically, intradermal injection of a cholesterol-modified FGF5-targeted siRNA effectively prolonged the anagen phase of the hair follicles, whereas intradermal injection of the cholesterol-modified FGF18-targeted siRNA led to the mobilization of telogen follicles to enter the anagen phase earlier.

366,15367491,6469,F000001,1,"Requirement of the forkhead gene Foxe1, a target of sonic hedgehog signaling, in hair follicle morphogenesis. The forkhead transcription factor FOXE1 is mutated in patients with Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome that exhibit hair follicle defects, suggesting a possible role for Foxe1 in hair follicle morphogenesis. Here, we report that Foxe1 is specifically expressed in the lower undifferentiated compartment of the hair follicle, at a time and site that parallel activation of the Shh signaling pathway. The Foxe1 protein is also expressed in human and mouse basal cell carcinoma in which hedgehog signaling is constitutively activated, whereas it is undetectable in normal epidermis and squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of Gli2 in skin results in complete suppression of Foxe1 expression in the hair follicle, whereas transcriptionally active Gli2 stimulates activity of the Foxe1 promoter. Foxe1-null skin displays aberrant hair formation with the production of thinner and curly pelage hairs. Although the hair follicle internal structure is conserved and several lineage markers are properly expressed, the orderly downgrowth of follicles is strikingly disrupted, causing disorientation, misalignment and aberrantly shaped of hair follicles. Our findings provide a strong indication that the defect in Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome is due to altered FOXE1 function in the hair follicle, and is independent of systemic defects present in affected individuals. In addition, we establish Foxe1 as a downstream target of the Shh/Gli pathway in hair follicle morphogenesis, and as a crucial player for correct hair follicle orientation into the dermis and subcutis.",hair Follicle,Shh
367,15608839,16669,F000003,1,"A review: the location, molecular characterisation and multipotency of hair follicle epidermal stem cells. INTRODUCTION: Recent work has focused on the hair follicle as the main repository of multipotent stem cells in skin, which is a neat model to study the mechanisms regulating the proliferation, migration and final fate of adult stem cells. This review examines the available literature for its location, molecular markers and multipotency. METHODS: Peer-reviewed journals and monographs on the subject were covered. RESULTS: With the application of stem cell-labelling techniques and clonogenicity assay, it is clear that most of the hair follicle stem cells are located at the bulge region, but the base of the hair follicle does contain some clonogenic cells; whether they are stem cells is still unknown. Extensive works have been done in identifying hair follicle stem cells. The potential markers for hair follicle stem cells include: b1-integrin, keratin 19, a6- integrin, CD71, p63, and CD34. Most of these markers are expressed in high levels in hair follicle stem cells, but there is still difficulty in distinguishing hair follicle stem cells from their transitamplifying progeny, and the sorted hair follicle stem cells with these markers are far from pure. As hair follicle stem cells might have been activated after leaving the stem cell niche, the markers for cells in vitro might not be identical to those in vivo. Using double-labelling techniques with BrdU and 3H-Thymidine, and the creation of novel chimera transgenic mice, it was proved that hair follicle stem cells can repopulate wound epidermis, forming epidermis, hair follicles and sebaceous glands, but it contributes little to the epidermis in physiological condition, except the hair follicle. CONCLUSIONS: Slow cycling, label-retaining cells exist at the bulge of the hair follicle, with high proliferative potential and clonogenicity. The putative bulge stem cells can contribute to the epidermis, outer root sheath, inner root sheath, hair shaft and sebaceous gland. However, they still lack certain markers to distinguish bulge stem cells from their progeny, and much work needs to focus on the interrelations between bulge cells and interfollicular keratinocyte stem cells, the relations between bulge cells and dermal papilla mesenchyme cells, and the mechanism of hair growth.",hair growth,keratin 19

The development of ectodermal organs requires signalling by ectodysplasin (Eda), a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family member, its receptor Edar and downstream activation of the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor. In humans, mutations in the Eda pathway components cause hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, a syndrome characterized by missing teeth, sparse hair and defects in sweat glands. It has been postulated that Eda acts redundantly with another TNF pathway to regulate ectodermal organogenesis. A potential candidate is Troy (or TNFRSF19 or Taj), a TNF receptor which is homologous with Edar in its ligand-binding domain, and is expressed in an overlapping pattern. We have characterized Troy null mice and crossed them with Eda-deficient mice. Single Troy mutants had no defects in ectodermal organs. Analysis of the double mutants revealed an essential role for Troy in hair follicle development. In mice, hair follicles develop in three different waves. Only primary hair follicles are missing in Eda single mutants, whereas the compound mutants lacked also the follicles of the second wave, as well as all hair follicles in the middle of crown leading to focal alopecia. Assessment of NF-kappaB activity with a transgenic reporter construct indicated that Eda is the main activator of NF-kappaB signalling in developing skin appendages and surprisingly that the functional overlap of Troy and Eda signalling pathways is mediated by NF-kappaB independent pathways.",hair Follicles,ectodysplasin

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is an important regulator of growth, survival, and differentiation in many tissues. It is produced in several isoforms that differ in their N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal extension peptide. The locally acting isoform of IGF-1 (mIGF-1) was previously shown to enhance the regeneration of both muscle and heart. In this study, we tested the therapeutic potential of mIGF-1 in the skin by generating a transgenic mouse model in which mIGF-1 expression is driven by the keratin 14 promoter. IGF-1 levels were unchanged in the sera of hemizygous K14/mIGF-1 transgenic animals whose growth was unaffected. A skin analysis of young animals revealed normal architecture and thickness as well as proper expression of differentiation and proliferation markers. No malignant tumors were formed. Normal homeostasis of the putative stem cell compartment was also maintained. Healing of full-thickness excisional wounds was accelerated because of increased proliferation and migration of keratinocytes, whereas inflammation, granulation tissue formation, and scarring were not obviously affected. In addition, mIGF-1 promoted late hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling.

BACKGROUND: Alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is a well-tolerated immunomodulator with cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects that is known to stimulate melanogenesis and proliferation of follicular melanocytes. As human hair follicles (HFs) locally synthesize alpha-MSH, pharmacologically more easily handled alpha-MSH-related tripeptides, such as K(D)PT, may imitate this endogenous regulation, and may show a favourable side-effect profile on clinical use. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of the synthetic, alpha-MSH-related peptide K(D)PT [which is identical to interleukin (IL)-1beta(193-195)] on melanogenesis in human anagen HFs, under normal and proinflammatory growth conditions. METHODS: Normal human anagen VI scalp HFs were microdissected and organ cultured with different concentrations of K(D)PT with or without coadministration of a proinflammatory, catagen-inducing stimulus, interferon (INF)-gamma. Masson-Fontana histochemistry and NKI/beteb immunohistochemistry were employed to assess changes in the degree of human HF pigmentation and melanocyte dendricity. RESULTS: As confirmed by quantitative (immuno-)histomorphometry, compared with controls, K(D)PT alone did not affect human HF pigmentation in organ culture. However, in the presence of a strong, prototypic proinflammatory stimulus (IFN-gamma), K(D)PT significantly stimulated HF melanin content and melanocyte dendrite formation in situ. CONCLUSIONS: The IL-1beta- and alpha-MSH-related tripeptide, K(D)PT, displays interesting hair pigmentation-stimulatory activities under proinflammatory conditions. These might become exploitable for innovative antigreying strategies, notably in postinflammatory poliosis (regrowth of white hair, e.g. during recovery from alopecia areata), where no effective clinical therapy is yet available.",hair Follicle,alpha-MSH
386,19052558,19016,F000001,1,"Hair follicle stem cell-specific PPARgamma deletion causes scarring alopecia. Primary cicatricial or scarring alopecias (CA) are a group of inflammatory hair disorders of unknown pathogenesis characterized by the permanent destruction of the hair follicle. The current treatment options are ineffective in controlling disease progression largely because the molecular basis for CA is not understood. Microarray analysis of the lymphocytic CA, Lichen planopilaris (LPP), compared to normal scalp biopsies identified decreased expression of genes required for lipid metabolism and peroxisome biogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis showed progressive loss of peroxisomes, proinflammatory lipid accumulation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells followed by destruction of the pilosebaceous unit. The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, a transcription factor that regulates these processes, is significantly decreased in LPP. Specific agonists of PPARgamma are effective in inducing peroxisomal and lipid metabolic gene expression in human keratinocytes.

Hair follicles (HFs) maintain a peripheral, functional equivalent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, whose most proximal element is corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The mast cell (MC)-rich connective-tissue sheath (CTS) of mouse vibrissa HFs harbors MC precursors. Differentiation of these MC precursors into mature MCs can be induced by stem cell factor (SCF). We have investigated whether the MC progenitors of normal human scalp HF CTS respond to stimulation with CRH. Microdissected anagen HFs and full-thickness scalp skin were treated with CRH (10(-7) M). CRH treatment induced the degranulation of CTS MCs, in addition to increasing the number of CTS MCs in full-thickness skin and HF organ cultures in situ. In the latter, cells with characteristic MC features emigrated from the CTS. CRH-receptor protein expression in the CTS was colocalized with Kit expression on some CTS MCs in situ. CRH treatment upregulated SCF mRNA and protein expression within the HF epithelium. In skin organ culture, CRH-induced degranulation of CTS MCs was abolished by anti-SCF antibody. We demonstrate that human skin is an extramedullary reservoir for MC precursors, and we have identified a regulatory loop between CRH and SCF signaling. This highlights a previously unpublished finding about neuroendocrine control of human MC biology.",Hair Follicles,Kit

The hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) contains a unique prominin-1/CD133-positive (CD133+) cell subpopulation, which has been shown to possess hair follicle-inducing capability. By assaying for endogenous CD133 expression and performing lineage tracing using CD133-CreERT2; ZsGreen1 reporter mice, we find that CD133 is expressed in a subpopulation of DP cells during the growth phase of the murine hair cycle (anagen), but is absent at anagen onset. However, how CD133+ DP cells interact with keratinocytes to induce hair regenerative growth remains unclear. Wnt/beta-catenin has long been recognized as a major signaling pathway required for hair follicle morphogenesis, development, and regeneration. Nuclear Wnt/beta-catenin activity is observed in the DP during the hair growth phase. Here we show that induced expression of a stabilized form of beta-catenin in CD133+ DP cells significantly accelerates spontaneous and depilation-induced hair growth. However, hair follicle regression is not affected in these mutants. Further analysis indicates that CD133+ DP-expressed beta-catenin increases proliferation and differentiation of epithelial matrix keratinocytes. Upregulated Wnt/beta-catenin activity in CD133+ DP cells also increases the number of proliferating DP cells in each anagen follicle.

Histological examination of skin tissue revealed that Tbeta4-overexpressing, transgenic goats had a higher secondary to primary hair follicle (S/P) ratio compared to wild type goats.

Furthermore, we provide evidence that, contrary to the prevailing model, asymmetrical localization of the Fzd6 protein is not observed in skin epithelial cells. Through transcriptome analyses and in vitro studies, we show collagen triple helix repeat containing 1 (Cthrc1) to be a potential downstream effector of Fzd6, but not of Fzd3.

With the advantage of high throughput RNA-seq, we synchronously identified 2540 lncRNAs and 536 miRNAs from two types of cellular samples at 4th passages. Compared with DFs, 1286 mRNAs, 18 lncRNAs, and 42 miRNAs were upregulated, while 1254 mRNAs, 53 lncRNAs and 44 miRNAs were downregulated in DPCs. Through overlapping with mice data, we ultimately defined 25 core signatures of DPCs, including HOXC8 and RSPO1, two crucial activators for hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Subsequently, we emphatically investigated the impacts of miRNAs and lncRNAs (cis- and trans- acting) on the genes, indicating that ncRNAs extensively exert negative and positive effects on their expressions. Furthermore, we screened lncRNAs acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to sponge miRNAs and relief their repressive effects on targeted genes, and constructed related lncRNAs-miRNAs-HOXC8/RSPO1 interactive lines using bioinformatic tools. As a result, XR_310320.3-chi-miR-144-5p-HOXC8, XR_311077.2-novel_624-RSPO1 and others lines appeared, displaying that lncRNAs might serve as ceRNAs to indirectly adjust HFSCs status in hair growth. CONCLUSION: The present study provides an unprecedented inventory of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in goat DPCs and DFs. We also exhibit some miRNAs and lncRNAs potentially participate in the modulation of HFSCs activation via delicately adjusting core signatures of DPCs. Our report shines new light on the latent roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of ncRNAs on hair growth.""",hair Follicle,RSPO1

Recent studies have reported that T-reg cells are intimately linked with hair follicles in a stage-dependent manner and play an important role in hair follicle cycling and regeneration in murine skin. Further study revealed that T-reg cell's regulation of hair follicle growth is through its preferential expression of the Notch ligand Jagged-1 (Jag1), which facilitates hair follicle regeneration. However, the role of Jag1 in androgen-suppressed hair growth is yet to be investigated. In addition, although epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a mitogen for cells including skin cells, whether it works synergistically with Jag1 to enhance hair follicle development is unknown. The current study intended to investigate effects of topical application of Jag1 on androgen-suppressed hair growth, and to determine the potential synergistic effect of EGF and Jag1 in this process in vivo. Fifty mice were depilated at the dorsal back area to achieve synchronized anagen development, and randomly divided into five groups with the following topical treatments control for 14 days; testosterone to induce androgenetic alopecia; Jagged1 (testosterone + Jagged1); EGF (testosterone + EGF); and Jagged1 + EGF (testosterone + Jagged1 + EGF). It was found that EGF and Jag1 by itself respectively, did not promote androgen-suppressed hair growth significantly. This stimulating effect was enhanced in the presence of both EGF and Jagged1 (p < 0.05).

In this study, we investigated the effects of HP on the apoptosis and proliferation of hair follicles in chemotherapy-induced alopecia. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice in telogen were depilated to enter anagen. After 9 days, dystrophic catagen was induced by the intraperitoneal injection of 150 mg/kg cyclophosphamide. During 9 to 16 days, 0.1 and 1 mg/mL HP were topically applied to depilated dorsal skin. RESULTS: Dystrophic hair follicles by cyclophosphamide were recovered by HP treatment. New hair shafts containing hair fibers appeared to be straight after HP treatment. Immunohistological staining revealed a significant increase of Ki67-positive cells in hair follicles treated with 1 mg/mL HP.

The hair follicle is an excellent mini-system illustrating the mechanisms governing organogenesis and regeneration. Although the general mechanisms modulating skin and hair follicle development are widely studied in mouse and chicken models, the delicate network regulating skin and hair diversity remains largely unclear. Sheep is an additional model to address the various wool characteristics observed in nature. The coarse and fine wool sheep with diverse fibers were examined to show differences in the primary wool follicle size and skin thickness. The molecular dynamics in skin staged at the primary wool follicle induction between two sheep lines were investigated by RNA-sequencing analyses to generate 1994 differentially expressed genes revealing marker genes for epithelium (6 genes), dermal condensate (38 genes) and dermal fibroblast (58 genes) highly correlated with skin and wool follicle morphological differences. The DEGs were enriched in GO terms represented by epithelial cell migration and differentiation, regulation of hair follicle development and ectodermal placode formation, and KEGG pathways typified by WNT and Hedgehog signaling pathways governing the differences of skin structure. The qPCR detection of 9 genes confirmed the similar expression tendency with RNA-sequencing profiles. This comparative study of coarse and fine wool sheep skin reveals the presence of skin and wool follicle differences at primary wool follicle induction stage, and indicates the potential effectors (APCDD1, FGF20, DKK1, IGFBP3 and SFRP4) regulating the skin compartments during the early morphogenesis of primary wool follicles to shape the variable wool fiber thickness in later developmental stages.",hair Follicle,DKK1

In this current study, we have investigated the possible involvement of necroptosis in the hair cycle regulation and further examined its underlying molecular mechanisms. Diverse RIPK1/3 inhibitors and siRNA were tested in the human outer-root sheath (ORS) cells and animal models. The expression and hair cycle-dependent expression of RIPK 1, respectively, were investigated in the hair follicles (HF) of human, pig, and the mouse. Resulting from the experiment, Nec-1s was most effective in the hair growth promotion among several inhibitors. Nec-1s induced the ORS cell proliferation and migration, and increased the HF length in mouse and pig organ cultures. In addition, it accelerated the telogen-to-anagen transition and elongated the anagen period in the mouse model. Both apoptosis and necroptosis were detected in hair cycle. RIPK1 and RIPK3 were highly expressed in ORS cells during the hair regression period. Nec-1s upregulated the mRNA expression of Wnt3a and Wnt5b, and the activity of beta-catenin.

As a subjective mood-related disorder with an unclear mechanism, depression has many problems in its diagnosis, which offers great space and value for research. At present, the methods commonly used to judge whether an animal model of depression has been established are mainly by biochemical index detection and behavioral tests, both of which inevitably cause stress in animals. Stress-induced hair growth inhibition has been widely reported in humans and animals. The simplicity of collecting hair samples and the observable state of hair growth has significant advantages; we tried to explore whether the parameters related to hair growth could be used as auxiliary indicators to evaluate a depression model in animals. The length and weight of the hair were calculated. Correlation analysis was conducted between the depressive behavioral results and the glucocorticoid levels in hair and serum. Learned helplessness combined with chronic restraint stress, and chronic unpredictable stress in the animal were detectable by superficial observation, weight ratio, and length of hair, and follicular development scores were significantly reduced compared to the control. The hair growth parameters of rats with depression, the rise in corticosterone, and the corresponding changes in behavioral parameters were significantly correlated. The neurotrophic factors, glucocorticoid-receptor (GR), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5), are associated with depression and hair growth.

Here, we investigated its stimulating effect and the underlying mechanism of action on hair growth using rat vibrissa follicles and dermal papilla cells (DPCs), required for the regulation of hair cycle and length. BDB increased the length of hair fibers in rat vibrissa follicles and the proliferation of DPCs, along with causing changes in the levels of cell cycle-related proteins. We investigated whether BDB could trigger anagen-activating signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and autophagy in DPCs. BDB induces activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway through the phosphorylation of GSG3beta and beta-catenin. BDB increased the levels of autophagic vacuoles and autophagy regulatory proteins Atg7, Atg5, Atg16L, and LC3B. We also investigated whether BDB inhibits the TGF-beta pathway, which promotes transition to the catagen phase. BDB inhibited the phosphorylation of Smad2 induced by TGF-beta1.

Hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling were examined in transgenic mice that overexpress the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor Noggin under the control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter. The Noggin transgene was misexpressed in the proximal portion of the hair follicle, primarily the matrix cells, apart from the usual expression in neurons. Transgene expression appeared only after induction of both the primary (tylotrich) and secondary (nontylotrich) pelage hair follicles had already occurred, thus allowing examination of the role of BMP signaling in follicles that had been induced normally in the presence of BMPs. The overexpression of Noggin in these animals resulted in a dramatic loss of hair postnatally. There was an apparently normal, but shortened period of postnatal hair follicle morphogenesis, followed by premature initiation of hair follicle cycling via entry into the first catagen transformation. This resulted in a complete loss of hair shafts from the nontylotrich hair follicles in these mice while the tylotrich hair follicles were normal. The onset of anagen of the first postnatal hair follicle cycle was also accelerated in the transgenic mice. Our results show that BMP signaling is specifically required for proper proliferation and differentiation during late morphogenesis of nontylotrich hair follicles and that inhibition of this signaling pathway may be one of the triggers for the onset of catagen when the follicles are in anagen and the onset of anagen when the follicles are in telogen.

426,15654948,3815,F000013,1,"Hair follicle pigmentation. Hair shaft melanin components (eu- or/and pheomelanin) are a long-lived record of precise interactions in the hair follicle pigmentary unit, e.g., between follicular melanocytes, keratinocytes, and dermal papilla fibroblasts. Follicular melanogenesis (FM) involves sequentially the melanogenic activity of follicular melanocytes, the transfer of melanin granules into cortical and medulla keratinocytes, and the formation of pigmented hair shafts. This activity is in turn regulated by an array of enzymes, structural and regulatory proteins, transporters, and receptors and their ligands, acting on the developmental stages, cellular, and hair follicle levels. FM is stringently coupled to the anagen stage of the hair cycle, being switched-off in catagen to remain absent through telogen. At the organ level FM is precisely coupled to the life cycle of melanocytes with changes in their compartmental distribution and accelerated melanoblast/melanocyte differentiation with enhanced secretory activity. The melanocyte compartments in the upper hair follicle also provides a reservoir for the repigmentation of epidermis and, for the cyclic formation of new anagen hair bulbs. Melanin synthesis and pigment transfer to bulb keratinocytes are dependent on the availability of melanin precursors, and regulation by signal transduction pathways intrinsic to skin and hair follicle, which are both receptor dependent and independent, act through auto-, para- or intracrine mechanisms and can be modified by hormonal signals. The important regulators are MC1 receptor its and adrenocorticotropic hormone, melanocyte stimulating hormone, agouti protein ligands (in rodents), c-Kit, and the endothelin receptors with their ligands.

Hair follicles undergo cycles of proliferation and apoptotic regression, offering an excellent paradigm to study how this transition is governed. Several factors are known to affect the hair cycle, but it remains a mystery whether Akt kinases that are downstream of growth factor signaling impact this equilibrium. We now show that an Akt relative, Sgk (serum and glucocorticoid responsive kinase) 3, plays a critical role in this process. Hair follicles of mice lacking Sgk3 fail to mature normally. Proliferation is reduced, apoptosis is increased, and follicles prematurely regress. Maintenance of the pool of transiently amplifying matrix cells is impaired. Intriguingly, loss of Sgk3 resembles the gain of function of epidermal growth factor signaling.

Hair follicles undergo cycles of proliferation and apoptotic regression, offering an excellent paradigm to study how this transition is governed. Several factors are known to affect the hair cycle, but it remains a mystery whether Akt kinases that are downstream of growth factor signaling impact this equilibrium. We now show that an Akt relative, Sgk (serum and glucocorticoid responsive kinase) 3, plays a critical role in this process. Hair follicles of mice lacking Sgk3 fail to mature normally. Proliferation is reduced, apoptosis is increased, and follicles prematurely regress. Maintenance of the pool of transiently amplifying matrix cells is impaired. Intriguingly, loss of Sgk3 resembles the gain of function of epidermal growth factor signaling. Using cultured primary keratinocytes, we find that Sgk3 functions by negatively regulating phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signaling. Our results reveal a novel and important function for Sgk3 in controlling life and death in the hair follicle.",hair cycle,Sgk

The recent elucidation of the human type I keratin gene domain allowed the completion of the so far only partially characterized subcluster of type I keratin genes, KRT25-KRT28 (formerly KRT25A-KRT25D), representing the counterparts of the type II inner root sheath (IRS) keratin genes, KRT71-KRT74 (encoding proteins K71-K74, formerly K6irs1-K6irs4). Here, we describe the expression patterns of the type I IRS keratin proteins K25-K28 (formerly K25irs1-K25irs4) and their mRNAs. We found that K25 (K25irs1), K27 (K25irs3), and K28 (K25irs4) occur in the Henle layer, the Huxley layer, and in the IRS cuticle. Their expression extends from the bulb region up to the points of terminal differentiation of the three layers. In contrast, K26 (K25irs2) is restricted to the upper IRS cuticle. Apart from the three IRS layers, K25 (K25irs1), K27 (K25irs3), and K28 (K25irs4) are also present in the hair medulla. Based on previous, although controversial claims of the occurrence in the IRS of various """"classical"""" epithelial keratins, we undertook a systematic study using antibodies against the presently described human epithelial and hair keratins and show that the type I keratins K25-K28 (K25irs1-K25irs4) and the type II keratins K71-K74 (K6irs1-K6irs4) represent the IRS keratins of the human hair follicle.""",hair Follicle,K28

BACKGROUND: Wnt10b (wingless-related mouse mammary tumour virus integration site 10b) plays various roles in a wide range of biological actions, including hair-follicle development. AIM: To assess the roles that Wnt10b plays in postnatal hair-follicle growth. METHODS: Adenovirus vectors AdWnt10b, AdGFP, AdGFP plus AdRFP, AdWnt10b plus AdFrzB, and AdWnt10b plus AdSimBC were co-cultured separately with vibrissae. In situ protein expression of Wnt10b, beta-catenin and Lef1 was determined by immunohistochemistry, and the proliferation status of the hair follicle was detected by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling. The presence of Wnt signalling molecules in the three stages of hair-follicle growth was detected by PCR-based microarray. RESULTS: AdWnt10b-infected cells were able to secrete bioactive Wnt10b, and when this was added into the basal medium, the vibrissae grew faster than in control medium or in medium containing canonical Wnt signalling antagonists. The in situ protein expression of Wnt10b was consistent with that of beta-catenin and Lef1. The expression locus of Wnt10b was almost the same as the proliferating cells labelled by BrdU in the anagen hair follicle. CONCLUSIONS: Wnt10b may promote hair-follicle growth by inducing the switch from telogen to anagen via a canonical Wnt signalling pathway to promote the proliferation of matrix cells.",hair-Follicle development,Wnt10b

BACKGROUND: AEC (ankyloblepharon-ectodermal defects-clefting) syndrome is an autosomal dominant ectodermal dysplasia disorder caused by mutations in the transcription factor p63. Clinically, the skin is dry and often fragile; other features can include partial eyelid fusion (ankyloblepharon), hypodontia, orofacial clefting, sparse hair or alopecia, and nail dystrophy. OBJECTIVES: To investigate how p63 gene mutations affect gene and protein expression in AEC syndrome skin. METHODS: We performed microarray analysis on samples of intact and eroded AEC syndrome skin compared with control skin. Changes were verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and, for basal keratinocyte-associated genes, by immunohistochemistry and analysis of microdissected skin. RESULTS: We identified significant upregulation of six genes and downregulation of 69 genes in AEC syndrome skin, with the main changes in genes implicated in epidermal adhesion, skin barrier formation and hair follicle biology. There was reduced expression of genes encoding the basement membrane proteins FRAS1 and collagen VII, as well as the skin barrier-associated small proline-rich proteins 1A and 4, late cornified envelope protein 5A, hornerin, and lipid transporters including ALOX15B. Reduced expression of the hair-associated keratins 25, 27, 31, 33B, 34, 35, 81 and 85 was also noted. We also confirmed similar alterations in gene expression for 26 of the 75 genes in eroded AEC scalp skin.

434,22537489,12387,F000020,1,"Polyclonal origin and hair induction ability of dermal papillae in neonatal and adult mouse back skin. Hair follicle development and growth are regulated by Wnt signalling and depend on interactions between epidermal cells and a population of fibroblasts at the base of the follicle, known as the dermal papilla (DP). DP cells have a distinct gene expression signature from non-DP dermal fibroblasts. However, their origins are largely unknown. By generating chimeric mice and performing skin reconstitution assays we show that, irrespective of whether DP form during development, are induced by epidermal Wnt activation in adult skin or assemble from disaggregated cells, they are polyclonal in origin. While fibroblast proliferation is necessary for hair follicle formation in skin reconstitution assays, mitotically inhibited cells readily contribute to DP. Although new hair follicles do not usually develop in adult skin, adult dermal fibroblasts are competent to contribute to DP during hair follicle neogenesis, irrespective of whether they originate from skin in the resting or growth phase of the hair cycle or skin with beta-catenin-induced ectopic follicles. We propose that during skin reconstitution fibroblasts may be induced to become DP cells by interactions with hair follicle epidermal cells, rather than being derived from a distinct subpopulation of cells.",hair Follicle neogenesis,beta-catenin
435,25860385,12387,F000001,1,"Roles of GasderminA3 in Catagen-Telogen Transition During Hair Cycling. Hair follicles undergo cyclic behavior through regression (catagen), rest (telogen), and regeneration (anagen) during postnatal life. The hair cycle transition is strictly regulated by the autonomous and extrinsic molecular environment. However, whether there is a switch controlling catagen-telogen transition remains largely unknown. Here we show that hair follicles cycle from catagen to the next anagen without transitioning through a morphologically typical telogen after Gsdma3 mutation. This leaves an ESLS (epithelial strand-like structure) during the time period corresponding to telogen phase in WT mice. Molecularly, Wnt10b is upregulated in Gsdma3 mutant mice. Restoration of Gsdma3 expression in AE (alopecia and excoriation) mouse skin rescues hair follicle telogen entry and significantly decreases the Wnt10b-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Overexpression of Wnt10b inhibits telogen entry by increasing epithelial strand cell proliferation. Subsequently, hair follicles with a Gsdma3 mutation enter the second anagen simultaneously as WT mice. Hair follicles cannot enter the second anagen with ectopic WT Gsdma3 overexpression. A luciferase reporter assay proves that Gsdma3 directly suppresses Wnt signaling. Our findings suggest that Gsdma3 has an important role in catagen-telogen transition by balancing the Wnt signaling pathway and that morphologically typical telogen is not essential for the initiation of a new hair cycle.",Hair Follicles,beta-catenin

BACKGROUND: Androgenic alopecia (AGA) occurs as a result of the contraction of the anagen phase because of the action of androgens on hair follicles. TGF-beta production from dermal papillae is enhanced by androgens, and growth inhibition of hair-follicle cells is induced by TGF-beta, and the hair cycle progresses from the anagen phase to the catagen phase. We investigated both the in vitro and in vivo potency of the newly identified ALK5 inhibitor TP0427736 {6-[4-(4-methyl-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-5-yl]-1,3-benzothiazole}. METHODS: For in vitro study, kinase inhibitory activity was evaluated with ELISA, and inhibitory activity against TGF-beta-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation in A549 cells and TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition of human outer root sheath cells were assayed using ELISA. For in vivo study, we used a mouse model that had been synchronized through dorsal hair depilation. RESULTS: TP0427736 inhibited ALK5 kinase activity with an IC50 of 2.72nM; this effect was 300-fold higher than the inhibitory effect on ALK3. In cell-based assays, TP0427736 inhibited Smad2/3 phosphorylation in A549 cells and decreased the growth inhibition of human outer root sheath cells. The topical application of TP0427736 significantly decreased Smad2 phosphorylation in mouse skin, and its repeated application suppressed the shortening of average hair follicle length during the transition from the late anagen phase to the catagen phase.

In this study, a comprehensive characterization of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) based on gene expression and enzyme functionality was made in a reconstructed skin epidermal model derived from the outer root sheath (ORS) of hair follicles (ORS-RHE). The ORS-RHE model XME gene profile was consistent with native human skin. Cytochromes P450 (CYPs) consistently reported to be detected in native human skin were also present at the gene level in the ORS-RHE model. The highest Phase I XME gene expression levels were observed for alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases and (carboxyl) esterases. The model was responsive to the CYP inducers, 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and beta-naphthoflavone (betaNF) after topical and systemic applications, evident at the gene and enzyme activity level. Phase II XME levels were generally higher than those of Phase I XMEs, the highest levels were GSTs and transferases, including NAT1. The presence of functional CYPs, UGTs and SULTs was confirmed by incubating the models with 7-ethoxycoumarin, testosterone, benzo(a)pyrene and 3-MC, all of which were rapidly metabolized within 24h after topical application. The extent of metabolism was dependent on saturable and non-saturable metabolism by the XMEs and on the residence time within the model. In conclusion, the ORS-RHE model expresses a number of Phase I and II XMEs, some of which may be induced by AhR ligands.

The majority of wound dressings currently used cannot achieve scarless skin regeneration with complete recovery of appendages such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Functional regeneration of these skin appendages is a great challenge. However, we achieved this goal by the successful development and utilization of a photo-crosslinkable sericin hydrogel (SMH) as a new type of wound dressing for repairing full-thickness skin injury. SMH implanted in a mouse full-thickness skin injury model promoted scarless wound healing with effective regeneration of hair follicles and sebaceous glands. By employing techniques of molecular biology, biochemistry, and in vivo cell tracing, we revealed the underlying repair mechanisms: SMH inhibited inflammation, stimulated angiogenesis during healing process, prevented scar tissue formation via regulating the expressions of TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta3, and recruited mesenchymal stem cells to injury sites for regeneration of skin appendages.

Poly-gamma-glutamic acid (gamma-PGA)-based nanoparticles draw remarkable attention as drug delivery agents due to their controlled release characteristics, low toxicity, and biocompatibility. 4HGF is an herbal mixture of Phellinus linteus grown on germinated brown rice, Cordyceps militaris grown on germinated soybeans, Polygonum multiflorum, Ficus carica, and Cocos nucifera oil. Here, we encapsulated 4HGF within PGA-based hydrogel nanoparticles, prepared by simple ionic gelation with chitosan, to facilitate its penetration into hair follicles (HFs). In this study, we report the hair promoting activity of 4HGF encapsulated with PGA nanoparticles (PGA-4HGF) and their mechanism, compared to 4HGF alone. The average size of spherical nanoparticles was ~400 nm in diameter. Continuous release of PGA-4HGF was observed in a simulated physiological condition. As expected, PGA-4HGF treatment increased hair length, induced earlier anagen initiation, and elongated the duration of the anagen phase in C57BL/6N mice, compared with free 4HGF treatment. PGA-4HGF significantly increased dermal papilla cell proliferation and induced cell cycle progression. PGA-4HGF also significantly increased the total amount of beta-catenin protein expression, a stimulator of the anagen phase, through induction of cyclinD1 and CDK4 protein levels, compared to free 4HGF treatment. Our findings underscore the potential of PGA nanocapsules to efficiently deliver 4HGF into HFs, hence promoting hair-growth. Therefore, PGA-4HGF nanoparticles may be promising therapeutic agents for hair growth disorders.",dermal papilla cell,HGF

Genodermatoses, such as heritable skin disorders, mostly represent Mendelian conditions. Congenital hypotrichosis (HY) characterize a condition of being born with less hair than normal. The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinicopathological phenotype of a breed-specific non-syndromic form of HY in Hereford cattle and to identify the causative genetic variant for this recessive disorder. Affected calves showed a very short, fine, wooly, kinky and curly coat over all parts of the body, with a major expression in the ears, the inner part of the limbs, and in the thoracic-abdominal region. Histopathology showed a severely altered morphology of the inner root sheath (IRS) of the hair follicle with abnormal Huxley and Henle's layers and severely dysplastic hair shafts. A genome-wide association study revealed an association signal on chromosome 5. Homozygosity mapping in a subset of cases refined the HY locus to a 690 kb critical interval encompassing a cluster of type II keratin encoding genes. Protein-coding exons of six positional candidate genes with known hair or hair follicle function were re-sequenced. This revealed a protein-changing variant in the KRT71 gene that encodes a type II keratin specifically expressed in the IRS of the hair follicle (c.281delTGTGCCCA; p.Met94AsnfsX14). Besides obvious phenocopies, a perfect concordance between the presence of this most likely pathogenic loss-of-function variant located in the head domain of KRT71 and the HY phenotype was found.

There is increasing evidence that mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in early morphogenesis stages of both tooth and hair follicles show many similarities. In order to explore whether stem cells from one tissue could interact with cells from another tissue, a series of experiments were carried out. Here we successfully extracted and identified stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) of 8-12 years old kids, and then found that SHED could promote hair regeneration in a mouse model. In vitro, SHED shortened the hair regeneration cycle and promoted the proliferation and aggregation of dermal cells. In vivo, when SHED and skin cells of C57 mice were subcutaneously co-transplanted to nude mice, more hair was formed than skin cells without SHED. To further explore the molecular mechanism, epidermal and dermal cells were freshly extracted and co-cultured with SHED. Then several signaling molecules in hair follicle regeneration were detected and we found that the expression of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and Glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) was up-regulated.

BACKGROUND: Gap junctions, composed of connexin (Cx) subunits, are channels that allow intercellular communication between adjacent cells and are thought to play a key role in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. The Cx expression pattern and formation of gap junctions in human fetal hair follicles has yet to be clarified, including the prominent follicular bulge region that is believed to be a site rich in stem cells. OBJECTIVES: To study the expression of two major Cxs, Cx26 and Cx43, in developing hair follicles in skin samples from a series of human fetuses of estimated gestational age (EGA) 88-163 days, and to determine quantitatively the presence of gap junctions. METHODS: We used immunofluorescence labelling to investigate the sequential expression pattern of Cx26 and Cx43 in developing human hair follicles. Gap junction formation was observed by electron microscopy and the numbers of gap junctions were analysed quantitatively. Results Both Cx26 and Cx43 expression were observed at 88 days' EGA in the inner part of the hair peg. At 135 days' EGA, Cx26 was expressed in the outer root sheath (ORS) and the inner root sheath (IRS), while Cx43 was expressed chiefly in the IRS, hair matrix and sebaceous glands. At 163 days' EGA, Cx26 expression was most intense in the outermost layer of the ORS, in contrast to Cx43 expression which was in the inner part of the ORS. In the bulge region, only Cx43 was expressed in a subset of cells in the bulge. Ultrastructurally, gap junctions were observed at 102 days' EGA in the hair peg, and the number of gap junctions increased as the hair follicle matured. Gap junctions were also observed between the bulge cells in considerable numbers. CONCLUSIONS: The changing expression patterns of Cx26 and Cx43 and the increasing gap junction numbers suggest a close association of Cx expression and gap junction formation with hair follicle morphogenesis. In addition, the present ultrastructural observations demonstrate that considerable numbers of the bulge cells, a putative site rich in hair follicle stem cells, form gap junctions during human hair follicle development.",hair Follicle morphogenesis,Cx26

Members of the serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) family are important mediators of growth factor and hormone signaling that, like their close relatives in the Akt family, are regulated by lipid products of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. SGK3 has been implicated in the control of cell survival and regulation of ion channel activity in cultured cells. To begin to dissect the in vivo functions of SGK3, we generated and characterized Sgk3 null mice. These mice are viable and fertile, and in contrast to mice lacking SGK1 or Akt2, respectively, display normal sodium handling and glucose tolerance. However, although normal at birth, by postpartum day 4 they have begun to display an unexpected defect in hair follicle morphogenesis. The abnormality in hair follicle development is preceded by a defect in proliferation and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in hair bulb keratinocytes. Furthermore, in cultured keratinocytes, heterologous expression of SGK3 potently modulates activation of beta-catenin/Lef-1-mediated gene transcription. These data establish a role for SGK3 in normal postnatal hair follicle development, possibly involving effects on beta-catenin/Lef-1-mediated gene transcription.",hair Follicle development,SGK3

BACKGROUND: Apoptosis sculptures the most complicated skin appendage, feathers, out of epidermal layers by playing a variety of roles (1). Human hair follicle formation is different from feathers in growth direction and pattern formation of proliferative zone. OBJECTIVE: To delineate the apoptotic events together with proliferation and differentiation in developing human hair follicle and emphasis on the mechanism and biological meaning of epidermal hair canal. METHODS: We used TUNEL to examine apoptosis and Ki-67, involucrin, filaggrin immuno-localization to examine proliferation and differentiation. RESULTS: In hair germs, apoptosis was diffuse in periderm, basal keratinocytes, and mesenchymal cells with high Ki-67 expression, but spared follicular germinative cells with low Ki-67 and high bcl-2 expression. In hair pegs, apoptosis was active in high Ki-67 expression area, like outer root sheath, hair follicle sheath, but spared dermal papilla with low Ki-67 and high bcl-2 expression. In bulbous pegs, apoptosis appeared in companion layer, precortical area, inner root sheath and outer root sheath, but spared bulge area with high bcl-2 expression. Apoptosis resulted in epidermal and subepidermal hair canal formation. Filaggrin and involucrin were expressed in the lining cells of hair canal. CD1a+ cells were densely distributed alone the hair canal before its opening. CONCLUSION: During human hair follicle morphogenesis, apoptosis coordinates with proliferation to shape the growth zone, creates space to free the hair shaft from follicular wall, and directs a driving force on hair shaft extension. Apoptosis accompanies the terminal differentiation of epidermal hair canal. The bottom becomes interfollicular epidermis after roof shedding and hair exposure.

To study the role of Smad4 in skin development and epidermal tumorigenesis, we disrupted this gene in skin using the Cre-loxP approach. We showed that absence of Smad4 blocked hair follicle differentiation and cycling, leading to a progressive hair loss of mutant (MT) mice. MT hair follicles exhibited diminished expression of Lef1, and increased proliferative cells in the outer root sheath. Additionally, the skin of MT mice exhibited increased proliferation of basal keratinocytes and epidermal hyperplasia. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the absence of Smad4 resulted in a block of both TGFbeta and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways, including p21, a well-known cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Consequently, all MT mice developed spontaneous malignant skin tumors from 3 months to 13 months of age. The majority of tumors are malignant squamous cell carcinomas. A most notable finding is that tumorigenesis is accompanied by inactivation of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (Pten), activation of AKT, fast proliferation and nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1. These observations revealed the essential functions of Smad4-mediated signals in repressing skin tumor formation through the TGFbeta/BMP pathway, which interacts with the Pten signaling pathway.",Hair Follicle,Lef1

Thus, we hypothesized that Musashi might be expressed in stem cells and early progenitor cells of HF epithelium. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting identified Musashi-1 (Msi-1) and Musashi-2 (Msi-2) mRNA and protein in cultured mouse keratinocytes, but only Msi-1 was identified in human keratinocytes. In mice, immunohistochemical studies showed that Msi-1 and Msi-2 were expressed in the epidermis and HFs from E14.5 until adulthood. In the early anagen phase, Msi-1 and Msi-2 were expressed in the bulge and secondary germ cells and subsequently in inner root sheath (IRS) cells, especially the middle IRS cells, during the late anagen phase. In human skin, Msi-1 was detected in fetal HF cells but not in adult HFs.

Mammalian hair follicles cycle between stages of rapid growth (anagen) and metabolic quiescence (telogen) throughout life. Transition from anagen to telogen involves an intermediate stage, catagen, consisting of a swift, apoptosis-driven involution of the lower half of the follicle. How catagen is coordinated, and spares the progenitor cells needed for anagen re-entry, is poorly understood. Keratin 17 (K17)-null mice develop alopecia in the first week post-birth, correlating with hair shaft fragility and untimely apoptosis in the hair bulb. Here we show that this abnormal apoptosis reflects premature entry into catagen. Of the proapoptotic challenges tested, K17-null skin keratinocytes in primary culture are selectively more sensitive to TNFalpha. K17 interacts with TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)-associated death domain protein (TRADD), a death adaptor essential for TNFR1-dependent signal relay, suggesting a functional link between this keratin and TNFalpha signaling. The activity of NF-kappaB, a downstream target of TNFalpha, is increased in K17-null skin. We also find that TNFalpha is required for a timely anagen-catagen transition in mouse pelage follicles, and that its ablation partially rescues the hair cycling defect of K17-null mice. These findings identify K17 and TNFalpha as two novel and interdependent regulators of hair cycling.",hair Follicle cycling,TNFalpha

The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha form heterodimeric complexes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). HIF-1alpha/ARNT and HIF-2alpha/ARNT complexes activate hypoxia-inducible genes that play critical roles in angiogenesis, anaerobic metabolism, and other processes in response to O2 deprivation. HIF-2alpha is known to regulate the function and/or differentiation of stem cells by activating the POU domain transcription factor Oct4; however, the precise underlying mechanism is unknown. This study examined the role of HIF-2alpha/ARNT in hair development using conditional-knockout mice, in which Arnt was specifically deleted in keratinocytes. In wild-type mice, HIF-2alpha and ARNT were highly expressed in the precortex above the hair matrix, an area containing differentiating stem cells. An analysis of hair size and type in these mice showed that loss of ARNT decreased the production of zigzag hairs, corresponding to reduced expression of HIF-2alpha and induction of the mammalian cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27 (Kip1). The results suggest that the HIF-2alpha/ARNT complex regulates hair follicle differentiation via induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and possibly p27(Kip1), as p27(Kip1) expression was not altered in ARNT knockout mice.

BACKGROUND: Mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, has anti-inflammatory effects, and is widely used as an immunomodulatory agent. However, the beneficial effect of MPA in hair-loss disorders is not fully understood. AIM: To investigate the direct effect of MPA on dermal papilla cells (DPCs), and to examine the hair growth-stimulating effects of MPA topically applied to mouse skin. METHODS: Cultured DPCs were treated with various concentrations of MPA and analysed by MTT assay. Expressions of hair growth-related genes, including Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related genes and cellular apoptosis-regulating genes, such as Bcl-2, Bax and caspase-9, were examined using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and western blotting. The Wnt/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway was analysed by western blotting. The effect of topically applied MPA on anagen hair follicle induction after microneedle (MN) treatment with or without minoxidil (MXD) was evaluated by histopathological examination and RT-PCR. RESULTS: MPA showed a promoting effect on DPC proliferation, which was associated with increased Axin2 transcription levels. In addition, phospho-ERK protein was detected in the MPA-treated DPCs. An increased Bcl-2/Bax transcript ratio contributed to cellular proliferation, and this was maintained in the MPA-treated environment. Topically applied MPA promoted anagen hair follicle induction in mice. The effect of MPA on hair follicles was compatible with that of MXD, and this effect was accelerated by MN treatment.

Optimized research models are required to further understand the pathogenesis and prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Our aim was to develop a mouse model for chemotherapy-induced alopecia by follicular unit transplantation of human hair follicles onto immunodeficient mice. Twenty-two weeks after transplantation, a single dose of cyclophosphamide (Cph) was administered to mice in the Cph100 (100 mg/kg) and Cph150 (150 mg/kg) groups. On day 6, hair follicles showed dystrophic changes, with swollen dermal papilla and ectopic melanin clumping in the hair bulb. In addition, upregulated expression of apoptotic regulators [P53, Fas/Fas-ligand, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL/TRAIL receptor), and Bax], increased apoptotic matrix keratinocytes, downregulated Ki67 expression, and decreased melanogenic protein in the hair bulb were noted in both groups. After 12 treatment days, hair follicles in Cph100 mice appeared to diminish dystrophic changes. In contrast, hair follicles of Cph150 mice prematurely entered a dystrophic catagen phase after 9 treatment days, and immunofluorescence staining for Ki67 and melanogenic protein expressions was barely visible. Two hair follicle damage response pathways were observed in this model, namely dystrophic anagen (Cph100) and catagen (Cph150) pathways.

480,30153818,5118,F000001,1,"Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of goat skins identifies signatures associated with hair cycling. BACKGROUND: Hair follicles (HFs), upon development, undergo repetitive cycles of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen). The transition between the stages is determined by multiple molecular signals, including DNA methylation, which plays important roles in mammalian cellular identity and is essential for the development of HFs. Secondary hair follicles (SHFs) in cashmere goat exhibit classic cyclic hair development, and little has been done on a genome-wide scale to examine potentially methylated genes involved in the hair cyclic transition. RESULTS: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles between skin tissues sampled during the anagen and telogen stages in cashmere goats were investigated using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). The methylation status was observed to be higher in the skin samples with HFs in the telogen than those in the anagen stage. A total of 1311 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between the two groups, which contained 493 fully annotated DMR-related genes (DMGs) (269 Hyper- DMGs and 224 Hypo-DMGs). Furthermore, a significant over-representation of the functional categories for DMGs related to immune response and intercellular crosstalk during hair cycling was observed. By integrating DNA methylation and mRNA expression data, we revealed that four genes (FMN1, PCOLCE, SPTLC3, and COL5A1) are crucial factors for elucidating epigenetic mechanisms contributing to the telogen-to-anagen transition. CONCLUSION: Our study provided systematic methylome maps pertaining to the hair cycling stages (anagen vs telogen) at a single-base resolution, and revealed stage-specific methylation loci during cashmere growth or quiescence. Furthermore, we identified epigenetically regulated genes that are potentially involved in HF development and growth in cashmere goats, and likely in other mammal species.",Hair Follicles,PCOLCE

Many hair loss disorders, including non-scaring alopecia, are caused by the arrest of hair follicles at the telogen phase, and the failure to enter the growth phase. Several studies report the efficacy of tofacitinib in promoting hair growth, by mechanisms not precisely known. The aim of this study was to identify other mechanisms by which tofacitinib, applied topically, promotes hair growth. The results showed that histopathological studies in mice treated topically with tofacitinib increased number of hair follicles, ratio of hair follicles in anagen phase, and length of hair infundibulum, and a reduced interfollicular epidermal thickness, compared to DMSO-treated mice. RT-PCR experiments showed significant increases in the expression of noggin (P < 0.05) and BMP4 (P < 0.05) mRNAs, which were greater than those in the vehicle-controlled group. Moreover, the expression of noggin and BMP4 mRNAs was significantly higher in the tofacitinib-treated group than in the minoxidil-treated group. This study would help understand the efficacy and mechanism by which tofacitinib, applied topically, triggers noggin and BMP4 mRNA expression, both being important molecules involved in the onset of the growth phase of hair growth cycles.",hair growth,noggin

Wnt-1, beta-catenin, PDGF, VEGF, TGF-beta1, and collagen I levels were analyzed with the Western blot method. RESULTS: In trichoscopy measurements, hair density increased in the NaB 4 mg group (90.9%). In histopathological examination, anagen follicles were observed to increase in the NaB 1 mg and 2 mg groups (p < 0.05). Follicle diameter increased in all NaB groups (p < 0.05).

AP-2alpha is a member of a family of transcription factors expressed in cells of the epithelial and neural crest lineage. AP-2alpha plays an essential role in embryonic development and in regulation of epithelial gene transcription. To further characterize the role of AP-2alpha in skin biology, we assessed its expression in the skin of C57BL/6J mice during defined stages of hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling. During early hair follicle morphogenesis, AP-2alpha was upregulated in the epidermal placode, in the basal keratinocytes of the hair follicle bud, and then in the inner root sheath. The follicular papilla cells underwent a brief upregulation of AP-2alpha expression during the initiation of hair shaft formation and active hair follicle downward growth. Completion of hair follicle morphogenesis was associated with a marked reduction of AP-2alpha immunoreactivity in the lower portion of the hair follicle including both epithelial and mesenchymal compartments. In adolescent mouse skin, consistently strong AP-2alpha expression was found in the basal keratinocytes of the epidermis, in the hair follicle infundibulum, and in the sebocytes. In the follicular papilla, AP-2alpha was weakly expressed in telogen, significantly upregulated in early anagen, then gradually declined, and reappeared again in middle catagen. In the inner root sheaths, AP-2alpha expression was detected during early and middle anagen and during middle catagen stages. Prominent AP-2alpha expression was also seen in the zone of club hair formation. Therefore, AP-2alpha upregulation in both epithelial and mesenchymal hair follicle compartments was coordinated with initiation of major remodeling processes. Our findings support the use of the hair follicle as a model to explore the role of AP-2alpha in physiologic remodeling of developing organs and in reciprocal ectodermal-mesenchymal interactions.",hair Follicle,AP-2alpha

Such CNS stem cells are selectively labeled by placing GFP under the control of the nestin regulatory sequences. During early anagen or growth phase of the hair follicle, nestin-expressing cells, marked by GFP fluorescence in nestin-GFP transgenic mice, appear in the permanent upper hair follicle immediately below the sebaceous glands in the follicle bulge. This is where stem cells for the hair follicle outer-root sheath are thought to be located. The relatively small, oval-shaped, nestin-expressing cells in the bulge area surround the hair shaft and are interconnected by short dendrites. The precise locations of the nestin-expressing cells in the hair follicle vary with the hair cycle. During telogen or resting phase and in early anagen, the GFP-positive cells are mainly in the bulge area. However, in mid- and late anagen, the GFP-expressing cells are located in the upper outer-root sheath as well as in the bulge area but not in the hair matrix bulb. These observations show that the nestin-expressing cells form the outer-root sheath. Results of the immunohistochemical staining showed that nestin, GFP, keratin 5/8, and keratin 15 colocalize in the hair follicle bulge cells, outer-root sheath cells, and basal cells of the sebaceous glands.

This essay reviews the available evidence that the proximal hair follicle epithelium generates and maintains an area of relative immune privilege during a defined segment of the hair cycle (i.e., during anagen). This immune privilege is chiefly characterized by a very low level of expression of MHC class Ia antigens and by the local production of potent immunosuppressive agents, such as alpha-MSH and TGF-beta1. We discuss the putative functions of immune privilige of the anagen hair bulb, favoring the view that immune privilege serves mainly to sequester anagen- and/or melanogenesis-associated autoantigens from immune recognition by autoreactive CD8+ T cells. On this basis, we develop how the """"immune privilege collapse model"""" of alopecia areata pathogenesis was conceived. In our discussion of the clinical implications of immune privilege, we outline the currently available evidence in support of this still hypothetical scenario to explain the initiation, progression, and termination of alopecia areata lesions. We review the most recent evidence from our laboratory that alpha-MSH, IGF-1, and TGF-beta1 can downregulate IFN-gamma-induced ectopic MHC class I expression in human anagen hair bulbs in vitro. Finally, we suggest that hair follicle-derived alpha-MSH, IGF-gamma, and TGF-beta1 form part of a constitutively active """"IP restoration machinery"""" of the anagen hair bulb, which we propose to be recruited whenever the hair follicle suffers immune injury.

493,14623238,12443,F000002,1,"Shh expression is required for embryonic hair follicle but not mammary gland development. The embryonic mammary gland and hair follicle are both derived from the ventral ectoderm, and their development depends on a number of common fundamental developmental pathways. While the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is required for hair follicle morphogenesis, the role of this pathway during embryonic mammary gland development remains undetermined. We demonstrate here that, unlike the hair follicle, both Shh and Ihh are expressed in the developing embryonic mouse mammary rudiment as early as E12.5. In Shh(-/-) embryos, hair follicle development becomes arrested at an early stage, while the mammary rudiment, which continues to express Ihh, develops in a manner indistinguishable from that of wild-type littermates. The five pairs of mammary buds in Shh(-/-) female embryos exhibit normal branching morphogenesis at E16.5, forming a rudimentary ductal structure identical to wild-type embryonic mammary glands. We further demonstrate that loss of Hh signaling causes altered cyclin D1 expression in the embryonic dermal mesenchyme. Specifically, cyclin D1 is expressed at E14.5 principally in the condensed mesenchymal cells of the presumptive hair follicles and in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells of the mammary rudiments in wild-type and Shh-deficient embryos. By E18.5, robust cyclin D1 expression is maintained in mammary rudiments of both wild-type and Shh-deficient embryos. In hair follicles of wild-type embryos by E18.5, cyclin D1 expression switches to follicular epithelial cells. In contrast, strong cyclin D1 expression is observed principally in the mesenchymal cells of arrested hair follicles in Shh(-/-) embryos at E18.5. These data reveal that, despite the common embryonic origin of hair follicles and mammary glands, distinct patterns of Hh-family expression occur in these two tissues. Furthermore, these data suggest that cyclin D1 expression in the embryonic hair follicle is mediated by both Hh-independent and Hh-dependent mechanisms.",hair Follicle development,cyclin D1

This review focuses on the recent identification of two novel neural crest-derived cells in the adult mammalian hair follicle, pluripotent stem cells, and Merkel cells. Wnt1-cre/R26R compound transgenic mice, which in the periphery express beta-galactosidase in a neural crest-specific manner, were used to trace neural crest cells. Neural crest cells invade the facial epidermis as early as embryonic day 9.5. Neural crest-derived cells are present along the entire extent of the whisker follicle. This includes the bulge area, an epidermal niche for keratinocyte stem cells, as well as the matrix at the base of the hair follicle. We have determined by in vitro clonal analysis that the bulge area of the adult whisker follicle contains pluripotent neural crest stem cells. In culture, beta-galactosidase-positive cells emigrate from bulge explants, identifying them as neural crest-derived cells. When these cells are resuspended and grown in clonal culture, they give rise to colonies that contain multiple differentiated cell types, including neurons, Schwann cells, smooth muscle cells, pigment cells, chondrocytes, and possibly other types of cells. This result provides evidence for the pluripotentiality of the clone-forming cell. Serial cloning showed that bulge-derived neural crest cells undergo self-renewal, which identifies them as stem cells. Pluripotent neural crest cells are also localized in the back skin hair of adult mice. The bulge area of the whisker follicle is surrounded by numerous Merkel cells, which together with innervating nerve endings form slowly adapting mechanoreceptors that transduce steady skin indentation. Merkel cells express beta-galactosidase in double transgenic mice, which confirms their neural crest origin. Taken together, our data indicate that the epidermis of the adult hair follicle contains pluripotent neural crest stem cells, termed epidermal neural crest stem cells (eNCSCs), and one newly identified neural crest derivative, the Merkel cell. The intrinsic high degree of plasticity of eNCSCs and the fact that they are easily accessible in the skin make them attractive candidates for diverse autologous cell therapy strategies.",eNCSCs,Wnt1

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), their antagonists, and BMP receptors are involved in controlling a large number of biological functions including cell proliferation, differentiation, cell fate decision, and apoptosis in many different types of cells and tissues during embryonic development and postnatal life. BMPs exert their biological effects via using BMP-Smad and BMP-MAPK intracellular pathways. The magnitude and specificity of BMP signaling are regulated by a large number of modulators operating on several levels (extracellular, cytoplasmic, nuclear). In developing and postnatal skin, BMPs, their receptors, and BMP antagonists show stringent spatio-temporal expressions patterns to achieve proper regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in the epidermis and in the hair follicle. Genetic studies assert an essential role for BMP signaling in the control of cell differentiation and apoptosis in developing epidermis, as well as in the regulation of key steps of hair follicle development (initiation, cell fate decision, cell lineage differentiation). In postnatal hair follicles, BMP signaling plays an important role in controlling the initiation of the growth phase and is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis-driven hair follicle involution. However, additional efforts are required to fully understand the mechanisms and targets involved in the realization of BMP effects on distinct cell population in the skin and hair follicle.

Since mammalian skin expresses the enzymatic apparatus for melatonin synthesis, it may be an extrapineal site of melatonin synthesis. However, evidence is still lacking that this is really the case in situ. Here, we demonstrate melatonin-like immunoreactivity (IR) in the outer root sheath (ORS) of mouse and human hair follicles (HFs), which corresponds to melatonin, as shown by radioimmunoassay and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The melatonin concentration in organ-cultured mouse skin, mouse vibrissae follicles, and human scalp HFs far exceeds the respective melatonin serum level and is significantly increased ex vivo by stimulation with norepinephrine (NE), the key stimulus for pineal melatonin synthesis. By real-time PCR, transcripts for the melatonin membrane receptor MT2 and for the nuclear mediator of melatonin signaling, retinoid orphan receptor alpha (ROR)alpha, are detectable in murine back skin. Transcript levels for these receptors fluctuate in a hair cycle-dependent manner, and are maximal during apoptosis-driven HF regression (catagen). Melatonin may play a role in hair cycle regulation, since its receptors (MT2 and RORalpha) are expressed in murine skin in a hair cycle-dependent manner, and because it inhibits keratinocyte apoptosis and down-regulates ERalpha expression. Therefore, the HF is both, a prominent extrapineal melatonin source, and an important peripheral melatonin target tissue. Regulated intrafollicular melatonin synthesis and signaling may play a previously unrecognized role in the endogenous controls of hair growth, for example, by modulating keratinocyte apoptosis during catagen and by desensitizing the HF to estrogen signaling.

Relatively little is known of the signaling pathways that initiate branching morphogenesis and the formation of the ducts from the embryonic buds.

Hair follicles (HFs) undergo cycles of degeneration (catagen), rest (telogen), and regeneration (anagen) phases. Anagen begins when the hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) obtain sufficient activation cues to overcome suppressive signals, mainly the BMP pathway, from their niche cells. Here, we unveil that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling is activated in HFSCs, which coincides with the HFSC activation at the telogen-to-anagen transition. By using both an inducible conditional gene targeting strategy and a pharmacological inhibition method to ablate or inhibit mTOR signaling in adult skin epithelium before anagen initiation, we demonstrate that HFs that cannot respond to mTOR signaling display significantly delayed HFSC activation and extended telogen. Unexpectedly, BMP signaling activity is dramatically prolonged in mTOR signaling-deficient HFs. Through both gain- and loss-of-function studies in vitro, we show that mTORC1 signaling negatively affects BMP signaling, which serves as a main mechanism whereby mTORC1 signaling facilitates HFSC activation. Indeed, in vivo suppression of BMP by its antagonist Noggin rescues the HFSC activation defect in mTORC1-null skin.

Gross examination indicated that HP markedly increased hair regrowth as well as hair density and diameter. Histologic analysis showed that HP treatment enhanced the anagen induction of hair follicles. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that BrdU incorporation and the expressions of PCNA were increased by treatment of HP. HP treatment significantly increased the expression of FGF-7, which plays pivotal roles to maintain anagen phase both protein and mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that HP has a potent hair growth-promoting activity; therefore, it may be a good candidate for the treatment of alopecia.",hair re-growth,fibroblast growth factor-7

Hair loss (alopecia) is a universal problem for numerous people in the world. The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of red ginseng oil (RGO) and its major components on hair re-growth using testosterone (TES)-induced delay of anagen entry in C57BL/6 mice and their mechanisms of action. Seven-week-old C57BL/6 mice were daily treated with TES for 1 h prior to topical application of 10% RGO, 1% linoleic acid (LA), 1% beta-sitosterol (SITOS), or 1% bicyclo(10.1.0)tridec-1-ene (BICYCLO) once a day for 28 days. Hair regenerative capacity was significantly restored by treatment of RGO and its major compounds in the TES-treated mice. Histological analysis showed that RGO along with LA and SITOS but not BICYCLO promoted hair growth through early inducing anagen phase that was delayed by TES in mice. Treatment of mice with RGO, LA, or SITOS up-regulated Wnt/beta-catenin and Shh/Gli pathways-mediated expression of genes such as beta-catenin, Lef-1, Sonic hedgehog, Smoothened, Gli-1, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin E in the TES-treated mice. In addition, RGO and its major components reduced the protein level of TGF-beta but enhanced the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.

Alopecia affected approximately 16.6% of all people in China, however, treatment options remain limited due to the side effects. Plant bioactive compound baicalin (BC) possesses hair growth-promotion activity, but poor solubility and unsuitable log P value restrict its topical application, and natural Glycyrrhizin (GL) can exactly overcome these drawbacks. Here, BC was encapsulated in GL to form GL-BC micelles for alopecia treatment. Simultaneously, tween 80 (TW) as carriers was incorporated in the GL-BC to form GL-TW-BC micelles. The topical penetration, penetration pathways, cellular uptake and the underlying mechanisms behind the hair loss reconstruction of the GL micelles were investigated. We found that the optimal GL-BC and GL-TW-BC formulations significantly improved the penetration and accumulation of BC in the porcine skin predominantly through the hair follicles pathways without causing skin irritation, which resulted in a targeted treatment. The proliferation of human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and effective cellular uptake was also enhanced. Moreover, the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, up-expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), alpha-melanocyte- stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were the mechanisms for the hair recovery.

Basal keratinocytes in the epidermis and hair follicle are biologically heterogeneous but must include a stable subpopulation of epidermal stem cells. In animal models these can be identified by their retention of radioactive label due to their slow cycle (label-retaining cells) but human studies largely depend on in vitro characterization of colony forming efficiency and clonogenicity. Differential integrin expression has been used to detect cells of increased proliferative potential but further stem cell markers are urgently required for in vivo and in vitro characterization. Using LHM2, a monoclonal antibody reacting with a high molecular weight melanoma-associated proteoglycan core protein, a subset of basal keratinocytes in both the interfollicular epidermis and the hair follicle has been identified. Coexpression of melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with keratins 15 and 19 as well as beta 1 and alpha 6 integrins has been examined in adult and fetal human skin from hair bearing, nonhair bearing, and palmoplantar regions. Although melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan coexpression with a subset of beta 1 integrin bright basal keratinocytes within the epidermis suggests that melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan colocalizes with epidermal stem cells, melanoma-associated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan expression within the hair follicle was more complex and multiple subpopulations of basal outer root sheath keratinocytes are described.

The number of HFs was reduced in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, and cycling epithelial cells were reduced in mutant mice HFs. Our results strongly suggest that BMPR1A signaling is essential for inner root sheath differentiation and is indispensable for HF renewal in adult skin.",HF,BMPR1A

Alopecia is a feature of vitamin D receptor (VDR) mutations in humans and in VDR null mice. This alopecia results from an inability to initiate the anagen phase of the hair cycle after follicle morphogenesis is complete. Thus, once the initial hair is shed it does not regrow. VDR expression in the epidermal component of the hair follicle, the keratinocyte, is critical for maintenance of the hair cycle. To determine which functional domains of the VDR are required for hair cycling, mutant VDR transgenes were targeted to the keratinocytes of VDR null mice. Keratinocyte-specific expression of a VDR transgene with a mutation in the hormone-binding domain that abolishes ligand binding restores normal hair cycling in VDR null mice, whereas a VDR transgene with a mutation in the activation function 2 domain that impairs nuclear receptor coactivator recruitment results in a partial rescue. Mutations in the nuclear receptor corepressor Hairless are also associated with alopecia in humans and mice. Hairless binds the VDR, resulting in transcriptional repression.

533,16086740,4842,F000001,1,"Differential expression of nitric oxide synthases in human scalp epidermal and hair follicle pigmentary units: implications for regulation of melanogenesis. BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is a ubiquitous gaseous lipophilic molecule generated from the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by the NO synthases (NOSs). Ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced NO production appears to stimulate epidermal melanogenesis. However, given their relative protection from UVR, it is unclear whether NO plays a similar role in hair bulb melanocytes. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify the expression profiles of the NOS isoforms endothelial NOS (eNOS), neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) and of phosphorylated eNOS and nitrotyrosine within the epidermal and follicular melanin units of normal human haired scalp during the hair growth cycle. METHODS: This study employed single and double immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining techniques using haired scalp from 10 healthy individuals (six women and four men). RESULTS: Melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis expressed eNOS, nNOS and nitrotyrosine. By contrast, melanogenically active melanocytes of the anagen hair bulb were wholly negative for these markers. However, other follicular melanocytes not actively involved in pigment production, including undifferentiated melanocytes located in the outer root sheath and melanocytes surviving the apoptosis-driven hair follicle (HF) regression during catagen/telogen, expressed eNOS, nNOS and nitrotyrosine. While iNOS was only weakly expressed in the basal layer of the human epidermis, it was highly expressed in keratinocytes of the inner root sheath (IRS), where it colocalized with trichohyalin, a differentiation-associated protein of the IRS that requires enzyme-catalysed conversion of arginine to citrulline. CONCLUSIONS: The NOS isoforms and nitrotyrosine are differentially expressed in different cutaneous melanocyte subpopulations. Results of this study suggest a possible role for eNOS, nNOS, iNOS and nitrotyrosine in melanocyte biology, particularly with respect to melanogenesis and melanocyte survival during HF regression. Another example of possible NO involvement in HF biology is the postsynthetic modification of trichohyalin in differentiating keratinocytes of the IRS. These results suggest that NO may influence several aspects of HF biology.",hair Follicle,neuronal NOS

Western blotting with a GSK-3beta-specific antibody, Y174, also demonstrated GSK-3beta expression in the follicles. Moreover, GSK-3beta immunostaining with Y174 showed that GSK-3beta colocalized with hair follicle bulge markers. Contrary to GSK-3beta, GSK-3 alpha was widely expressed throughout the follicles when immunostained with a specific antibody, EP793Y. We then investigated the influence of GSK-3 inhibition. A GSK-3 inhibitor, BIO, promoted the growth of human outer root sheath cells, which could be cultured for up to four passages. The BIO-treated cells exhibited smaller and more undifferentiated morphology than control cells. Moreover, in organ culture of plucked human hair, outer root sheath cells in the middle of a hair follicle proliferated when cultured with BIO.

Ectodysplasin (Eda), a member of the tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) family, regulates skin appendage morphogenesis via its receptor Edar and transcription factor NF-kappaB. In humans, inactivating mutations in the Eda pathway components lead to hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), a syndrome characterized by sparse hair, tooth abnormalities, and defects in several cutaneous glands. A corresponding phenotype is observed in Eda-null mice, where failure in the initiation of the first wave of hair follicle development is a hallmark of HED pathogenesis. In an attempt to discover immediate target genes of the Eda/NF-kappaB pathway, we performed microarray profiling of genes differentially expressed in embryonic skin explants after a short exposure to recombinant Fc-Eda protein. Upregulated genes included components of the Wnt, fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, Tnf, and epidermal growth factor families, indicating that Eda modulates multiple signaling pathways implicated in skin appendage development. Surprisingly, we identified two ligands of the chemokine receptor cxcR3, cxcl10 and cxcl11, as new hair-specific transcriptional targets of Eda.

Distinct hair-follicle regions had differences in their expression of ligands for CCR2 and CCR6. The isthmus expressed the chemokine CCL2; the infundibulum expressed the chemokine CCL20; and keratinocytes in the bulge produced the chemokine CCL8, which is the ligand for CCR8. Thus, distinct hair-follicle keratinocyte subpopulations promoted or inhibited repopulation with LCs via differences in chemokine production, a feature also noted in humans.

BACKGROUND: Hairless (HR), a transcriptional cofactor, plays important roles in hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and cycling. Recently, we reported the new Hr mutant mouse called """"Hairpoor"""" (Hr(Hp)) that causes HR overexpression through translational de-repression. The Msh homeobox 2 (Msx2) is a homolog of the Drosophila muscle segment homeobox (msh) gene, which expressed in the hair bulb, including in the germinal matrix, and its expression spreads into the upper region of the HF including the hair cortex. OBJECTIVE: Although Msx2 is regarded as an important gene in hair cycle control and hair shaft differentiation, the regulation of Msx2 expression is not well-known. METHODS: Using realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot, we investigated the relationship between HR and Msx2 in the Hr(Hp)/Hr(Hp) mouse during the HF morphogenesis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to compare the pattern of expression of MSX2 in Hr(Hp)/Hr(Hp) mouse skin with that in wild-type skin. Msx2 mRNA expression and promoter activity was estimated using a transient expression system to see whether HR down-regulates Msx2 expression in vitro. We also investigated whether downregulation of MSX2 by HR also affects the MSX2 regulatory pathway in the Hr(Hp)/Hr(Hp) mouse and in an in vitro system. RESULTS: We found that the expression of Msx2 was down-regulated by HR, which in turn down-regulated expression of Foxn1 and Lef1, MSX2 target genes, in vivo as well as in vitro.

Keratinocyte stem/progenitor cells (KSCs) reside in the bulge region of the hair follicles and may be involved in hair growth. Hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) and outer root sheath (ORS) cells were treated with conditioned medium (CM) of KSCs. Moreover, the effects of KSC-CM on hair growth were examined ex vivo and in vivo. A human growth factor chip array and RT-PCR were employed to identify enriched proteins in KSC-CM as compared with CM from keratinocytes. KSC-CM significantly increased the proliferation of HFDPCs and ORS cells, and increased the S-phase of the cell cycle in HFDPCs. KSC-CM led to the phosphorylation of ATK and ERK1/2 in both cell types. After subcutaneous injection of KSC-CM in C3H/HeN mice, a significant increase in hair growth and increased proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes ex vivo was observed.

556,28725654,4345,F000001,1,"Stem cells from human hair follicles: first mechanical isolation for immediate autologous clinical use in androgenetic alopecia and hair loss. BACKGROUND: Hair follicles are known to contain a well-characterized niche for adult stem cells: the bulge, which contains epithelial and melanocytic stem cells. Stem cells in the hair bulge, a clearly demarcated structure within the lower permanent portion of hair follicles, can generate the interfollicular epidermis, hair follicle structures, and sebaceous glands. The bulge epithelial stem cells can also reconstitute in an artificial in vivo system to a new hair follicle. METHODS: In this study, we have developed a new method to isolate human adult stem cells by mechanical centrifugation of punch biopsy from human hair follicles without culture condition. Here, we used human follicle stem cells (HFSCs), to improve the hair density in 11 patients (38 to 61 years old) affected by AGA in stage 3-5 as determined by the Norwood-Hamilton classification scale. RESULTS: The primary outcomes were microscopic identification and counting of HFSCs. The secondary outcomes were clinical preliminary results and safety and feasibility in HFSCs-treated scalp. Each scalp tissue suspension contained about 3,728.5+-664.5 cells. The percentage of hair follicle-derived mesenchymal stem cells CD44+ [from dermal papilla (DP)] was about 5%+0.7% whereas the percentage of hair follicle epithelial stem cells CD200+ (from the bulge) was about 2.6%+0.3%. In total, 23 weeks after the last treatment with HFSCs mean hair count and hair density increases over baseline values. In particular, a 29%+-5% increase in hair density for the treated area and less than a 1% increase in hair density for the placebo area. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that the isolated cells are capable to improve the hair density in patients affected by androgenetic alopecia (AGA).

BACKGROUND: Despite high demand for a remedy, the treatment options for female pattern hair loss (FPHL) are limited. FPHL is frequent in postmenopausal women. In ovariectomized (OVX) mice, which lack beta-estradiol (E2) and manifest hair loss mimicking FPHL, E2 supplementation has been shown to increase hair density. However, the mechanism by which E2 exhibits its biological activity remains elusive. OBJECTIVE: To identify the downstream targets of E2 in the context of FPHL pathophysiology and discover a potential therapeutic agent for the E2-dependent subtype of FPHL. METHODS: Human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) were cultured with E2, and a microarray analysis was performed to identify the genes regulated by E2. Using OVX mice, the identified gene product was intradermally administered and then quantitative image analysis of hair density was conducted. In silico analysis to link E2 and the identified gene was performed. RESULTS: Global gene expression and bioinformatics analyses revealed that the genes associated with the angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) pathway were upregulated by E2 in hDPCs. ANGPT2 was significantly downregulated in OVX mice than in sham-operated mice (P < 0.01). Importantly, hair density was higher in OVX mice treated with ANGPT2 than in control mice (P < 0.05). In silico analysis showed DNA sequences with high possibility of estrogen receptor binding in the promoter region of ANGPT2. CONCLUSION: The E2-ANGPT2 axis is present in hair follicles.

The genes with the highest expression levels in each group were identified and genes known from studies in other species to be associated with structure and function of hair follicles and epidermis were evaluated. Transcriptome profiling revealed that late anagen follicles expressed mainly keratins and telogen follicles expressed GSN and KRT15. The interfollicular epidermis expressed predominately genes encoding for proteins associated with differentiation. All sample groups express genes encoding for proteins involved in cellular growth and signal transduction. The expression pattern of skin-associated genes in dogs is similar to humans. Differences in expression compared to mice and humans include BMP2 expression mainly in telogen and high KRT17 expression in the interfollicular epidermis of dogs.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are the structurally similar and highly conserved type of functional proteins that play an important role in hair follicle growth and development. BMP7 was a differentially expressed gene in different patterns of Hu sheep lambskin identified using Agilent microarray. Since hair follicle is the basis of pattern formation of lambskin, and its growth and development is governed by dermal papilla cells (DPCs), to clarify the role of BMP7 and hair follicle, our study was designed to investigate the regulation between BMP7 and DPCs. Firstly, the CDS region of BMP7 was cloned by 3'Race and PCR in Hu sheep and performed serious of bioinformatic analysis. Then, the effects of BMP7 on DPCs were analyzed after overexpression and interference of BMP7 in dermal papilla cells by CCK8, EdU, and PI assay. Additionally, qPCR was also conducted to clarify the relationship between BMP7 and the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. A total of 1296 bp of the BMP7 CDS region sequence was sucessfully cloned in Hu sheep, encoding a signal peptide of 431 amino acids, molecular weight was 49,316.9 Da and the isoelectric point (Pi) was 7.75. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of BMP7 revealed that Hu sheep had high homology with Bos taurus, Homo sapiens, and Canis lupus familiaris. Structure domain prediction showed that TGF-beta superfamily domain exist between 330th-431th amino acid, BMP7 protein is a secreted protein. In BMP7 up-regulated DPCs, DPCs proliferation rate and cell cycle were significantly higher than that of NC group (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the expression level of Smad3, Smad4, Samd6, and TGF-beta1 in TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway were significantly lower than that in NC group (p < 0.05). In BMP7 down-regulated DPCs, it presented the opposite result. In conclusion, our study showed that BMP7 had a positive effect on DPCs by accelerating the proliferation and cell cycle of DPCs, and hypothesized that regulate hair follicles growth and development via TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway.

In addition we show that PRL exerts functional effects on anagen hair follicles in murine skin organ culture by down-regulation of proliferation in follicular keratinocytes. In telogen follicles, PRL-like immunoreactivity was detected in outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes. During early anagen (III to IV), the developing inner root sheath (IRS) and the surrounding ORS were positive for PRL. In later anagen stages, PRL could be detected in the proximal IRS and the inner layer of the ORS. The regressing (catagen) follicle showed a strong expression of PRL in the proximal ORS. In early anagen, PRLR immunoreactivity occurred in the distal part of the ORS around the developing IRS, and subsequently to a restricted area of the more distal ORS during later anagen stages and during early catagen. The dermal papilla (DP) stayed negative for both PRL and PRLR throughout the cycle. Telogen follicles showed only a very weak PRLR staining of ORS keratinocytes. The long-form PRLR transcript was shown by real-time polymerase chain reaction to be transiently down-regulated during early anagen, whereas PRL transcripts were up-regulated during mid anagen. Addition of PRL (400 ng/ml) to anagen hair follicles in murine skin organ culture for 72 hours induced premature catagen development in vitro along with a decline in the number of proliferating hair bulb keratinocytes. These data support the intriguing concept that PRL is generated locally in the hair follicle epithelium and acts directly in an autocrine or paracrine manner to modulate the hair cycle.",hair Follicles,PRL

Diffuse hair loss ranks among the most frequent and psychologically most distressing adverse effects of systemic therapy with retinoids, which severely limits their therapeutic use even where clinically desired. Since the underlying mechanisms of retinoid-induced effluvium are as yet unknown, we have investigated the influence of the prototypic retinoid all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, tretinoin) on the growth of human scalp hair follicles (HF) in culture. HF in the anagen VI stage of the hair cycle were cultured in the presence of 10(-8) or 10(-10) M ATRA. Compared with controls, hair shaft elongation declined significantly already after 2 d in the ATRA-treated group, and approximately 80% of the ATRA-treated HF had prematurely entered catagen-like stage at day 6, compared with 30% in the control group. This corresponded to an upregulation of apoptotic and a downregulation of Ki67-positive cells in ATRA-treated HF. Since transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has been implicated as a key inducer of catagen, we next studied whether ATRA treatment had any effect on follicular expression. TGF-beta2 immunoreactivity was detected in the outer root sheath of anagen VI scalp HF. In catagen follicles, TGF-beta2 was also expressed in the regressing epithelial strand. After 4 d of ATRA treatment, TGF-beta2 was significantly upregulated in anagen HF in the dermal papilla (DP) and the dermal sheath, 7, and TGF-beta neutralizing antibody partially abrogated at RA induced hair growth inhibition. Real-time PCR confirmed a significant upregulation of TGF-beta2 transcripts in ATRA-treated hair bulbs. This study is the first to provide direct evidence that ATRA can indeed induce a catagen-like stage in human HF and suggests that this occurs, at least in part, via upregulation of TGF-beta2 in the DP. Therefore, topical TGF-beta2/TGF-beta receptor II antagonists deserve to be explored for the prevention and management of retinoid-induced hair loss.",hair Follicle regression,transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta
571,22297635,110308,F000001,1,"Hair cycle resting phase is regulated by cyclic epithelial FGF18 signaling. Hair follicles repeatedly cycle through growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and resting (telogen) phases. Although the signaling molecules involved in the anagen and anagen-catagen transition have been studied extensively, the signaling that controls telogen is only partly understood. Here we show that fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)18 is expressed in a hair stem cell niche throughout telogen, and that it regulates the hair cycle through the non-growth phases. When the Fgf18 gene is conditionally knocked out in keratin 5-positive epithelial cells in mice, telogen becomes very short, giving rise to a strikingly rapid succession of hair cycles. In wild-type mice, hair follicle growth during anagen is strongly suppressed by local delivery of FGF18 protein. Our results demonstrate that epithelial FGF18 signaling and its reduction in the milieu of hair stem cells are crucial for the maintenance of resting and growth phase, respectively.",Hair Follicles,keratin 5

Topical antigen is acquired by Langerhans cells (LC) and CD11b+ cDC2s but not cDC1s, and both  LCs and CD11b+ cDC2s reaching the lymph node can prime T cells and expand LAP+ Tregs. However, LCs are neither required nor sufficient for T cell priming, and have no role in tolerance induction. Conversely, IRF-4-dependent cDC2s are required for T cell priming.

The hormonal response to stress is due to the HPA axis, which comprises hormones such as corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol. Many reports have shown that CRF, a crucial stress hormone, inhibits hair growth and induces hair loss. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of CRF on human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) as well as hair follicles and to investigate whether the HPA axis was established in cultured human DPCs. RESULTS: CRF inhibited hair shaft elongation and induced early catagen transition in human hair follicles. Hair follicle cells, both human DPCs and human ORSCs, expressed CRF and its receptors and responded to CRF. CRF inhibited the proliferation of human DPCs through cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Anagen-related cytokine levels were downregulated in CRF-treated human DPCs. Interestingly, increases in proopiomelanocortin (POMC), ACTH, and cortisol were induced by CRF in human DPCs, and antagonists for the CRF receptor blocked the effects of this hormone. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that stress can cause hair loss by acting through stress hormones.

BACKGROUND: Neutrophilic folliculitis is an inflammatory condition of hair follicles. In some neutrophilic folliculitis, such as in patients with acne and hidradenitis suppurativa, follicular hyperkeratosis is also observed. Neutrophilic folliculitis is often induced and/or exacerbated by a high-fat diet (HFD). However, the molecular mechanisms by which an HFD affects neutrophilic folliculitis are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to elucidate how an HFD promotes the development of neutrophilic folliculitis. METHODS: Mice were fed an HFD, and their skin was subjected to histologic, RNA sequencing, and imaging mass spectrometry analyses. To examine the effect of an HFD on neutrophil accumulation around the hair follicles, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was used as an irritant to the skin. RESULTS: Histologic analysis revealed follicular hyperkeratosis in the skin of HFD-fed mice. RNA sequencing analysis showed that genes related to keratinization, especially in upper hair follicular keratinocytes, were significantly upregulated in HFD-fed mice. Application of PMA to the skin induced neutrophilic folliculitis in HFD-fed mice but not in mice fed a normal diet. Accumulation of neutrophils in the skin and around hair follicles was dependent on CXCR2 signaling, and CXCL1 (a CXCR2 ligand) was produced mainly by hair follicular keratinocytes. Imaging mass spectrometry analysis revealed an increase in fatty acids in the skin of HFD-fed mice. Application of these fatty acids to the skin induced follicular hyperkeratosis and caused PMA-induced neutrophilic folliculitis even in mice fed a normal diet. CONCLUSION: An HFD can facilitate the development of neutrophilic folliculitis with the induction of hyperkeratosis of hair follicles and increased neutrophil infiltration around the hair follicles via CXCR2 signaling.",hair Follicles,CXCL1

BACKGROUND: Cornified cell envelope (CCE) formation is an important step in the final stage of keratinization, in which CCE precursor proteins including involucrin and loricrin are cross-linked by keratinocyte transglutaminases (TGases) to the inner surface of the plasma membrane of cornified cells, while the outer surface is coated with material derived from secreted lamellar granules. OBJECTIVES: Skin samples from human fetuses of a series of estimated gestational age (EGA) (49-163 days) were studied for the prescence of precursor proteins. Methods TGase activity was studied by in situ TGase activity assay, and ultrastructural features of CCE formation were observed at each stage of hair follicle development. We used immunofluorescent labelling to investigate the time and site of expression of CCE precursor proteins involucrin and loricrin, TGases 1, 2 and 3, and a 25-kDa lamellar granule-associated protein (LGP) in developing human hair follicles. RESULTS: In the hair germ (65-84 days EGA) (corresponding to the stages 1-2 of murine hair follicle morphogenesis), only TGase 2 was observed in the entire hair germ, where in situ TGase activity was weakly positive, although thickening of cell membrane was not seen ultrastructurally. In the hair peg (85-104 days EGA) (corresponding to the stage 3 of murine hair follicle morphogenesis), loricrin and TGase 2 were seen in cells of the upper part of the hair peg while TGase 1, 3 and LGP were observed in the inner cells of the hair peg. In situ TGase activity was weakly positive in the upper part and inner cells of the hair peg. In the bulbous hair peg (105-135 days EGA) (corresponding to the stages 4-6 of murine hair follicle morphogenesis) and differentiated lanugo hair follicle (> 135 days EGA) (corresponding to the stages 7-8 of murine hair follicle morphogenesis), immunoreactivities of involucrin, loricrin, TGase 1, 2, 3, in situ TGase activity and LGP were detected in the inner root sheath cells, hair canals and inner cells of the outer root sheath in the region of the isthmus. Ultrastructurally, thickening of cell membrane was already seen in the inner root sheath cells of the bulbous hair peg and electron-dense, thick CCE was observed in the hair cuticle and hair canal of differentiated lanugo hair follicle. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that, in terms of CCE formation, certain portions of the developing human hair follicle have already been determined in differentiation of the hair canal and cuticle at the hair peg stage.",hair Follicle morphogenesis,loricrin

Estrogen is of importance for the regulation of hair growth and epidermal thickness. The effects of estrogen have predominantly been studied in females; however, recent studies demonstrate that estrogen also is critical for males. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative functional importance of estrogen receptor alpha and estrogen receptor beta in the regulation of the hair follicle cycling and epidermal thickness in male mice. Seven month old transgenic male mice, lacking estrogen receptor alpha (ERKO), estrogen receptor beta (BERKO), or both receptors (DERKO), were orchidectomized and treated for 3 week with 17beta-estradiol or vehicle. Orchidectomy induced a synchronized anagen phase of the hair follicles, which was inhibited by 17beta-estradiol treatment in wild-type and BERKO mice, but not in ERKO and DERKO mice. Furthermore, 17beta-estradiol treatment increased the thickness of epidermis in wild-type and BERKO mice, but not in ERKO and DERKO. This study demonstrates that estrogen is of importance for the regulation of hair follicle cycling and epidermal thickness in male mice. The effect on hair follicle cycling is caused by an estrogen receptor alpha mediated inhibition of telogen-anagen transition and the effect of estrogen to increase epidermal thickness is associated with an estrogen receptor alpha mediated increase in the proliferative rate of the keratinocytes in the basal cell layer of the epidermis.",hair Follicle cycling,Estrogen receptor alpha
592,12535193,21825,F000013,1,"Thrombospondin-1 plays a critical role in the induction of hair follicle involution and vascular regression during the catagen phase. Hair growth is associated with pronounced vascular-endothelial-growth-factor-induced perifollicular angiogenesis, whereas the catagen regression phase is characterized by apoptosis-driven blood vessel regression. The biologic relevance of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis in the control of hair cycling, however, has remained unknown. We studied the expression and biologic role of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) during the induced adult hair follicle cycle in wild-type, TSP-1 deficient, and TSP-1 overexpressing transgenic mice. TSP-1 expression was absent from hair bulb and dermal papilla cells during early to mid-anagen but was highly upregulated throughout the catagen involution phase. In TSP-1 deficient mice, the follicle growth phase was significantly prolonged, associated with increased perifollicular vascularization and vascular proliferation. Conversely, hair follicle growth was delayed in K14/TSP-1 transgenic mice that expressed high levels of TSP-1 in outer root sheath keratinocytes, associated with reduced perifollicular vascularization. These effects were most probably mediated via its antiangiogenic effects because TSP-1 did not affect the growth of cultured murine vibrissae in the absence of a functional vascular system. These results identify a critical role of TSP-1 in the induction of anagen follicle involution, with potential implications for the therapeutic modulation of hair follicle growth.",hair cycling,Thrombospondin-1

Chemotherapy alters the structure and function of hair follicle melanocytes. Molecular mechanisms controlling melanocyte responses during chemotherapy-induced hair loss, however, remain largely unknown. Using immunohistology and multicolor confocal microscopy, we show here that cyclophosphamide administration to C57BL/6 mice alters the activity and fate of hair follicle melanocytes. After 24-48 h, hair bulb melanocytes expressing Fas undergo apoptosis. The number of apoptotic follicular melanocytes is significantly reduced (p<0.01) in cyclophosphamide-treated Fas knockout mice compared to wild-type controls, suggesting that Fas signaling contributes to chemotherapy-induced melanocyte death. After 3-5 d, surviving hair bulb melanocytes express c-kit receptor, proliferate, and appear to migrate up the outer root sheath. Tyrosinase-positive and melanogenically active cells then appear in the epidermis. By Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, expression levels of the c-kit ligand, stem cell factor, in skin and epidermis are strongly increased after cyclophosphamide treatment. Cyclophosphamide-induced migration of the hair follicle melanocytes into epidermis is completely abrogated by administration of c-kit neutralizing antibody. These data suggest that chemotherapy induces a complex response in the hair follicle melanocytes, which includes apoptosis, proliferation, and migration. Pharmacologic manipulation of Fas and c-kit signaling pathways might be useful for the correction of skin hyperpigmentation as a side-effect of chemotherapy.",hair Follicle,Tyrosinase

During hair follicle morphogenesis, melanocyte precursors migrate into developing hair follicles and give rise to differentiated melanocytes that actively produce and transport pigment into the keratinocytes that form the hair shaft; however, patterns of melanocyte proliferation and differentiation during formation of the hair pigmentation unit remain to be elucidated. Using multicolor confocal microscopy and double immunofluorescence of melanogenic proteins (tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2, tyrosinase) and the proliferative marker Ki67, we have studied melanocyte development in C57BL/6 mouse embryonic hair follicles. Proliferating melanocyte precursors (tyrosinase-related protein-2/Ki67+ cells) are seen in the hair follicles at stages 1-2 of morphogenesis, as follicular invagination begins. In stage 3-4 hair follicles, the majority of intrafollicular melanocytes remain tyrosinase-related protein-2+ and Ki67+, whereas some located adjacent to the forming dermal papilla begin to express tyrosinase-related protein-1, an early marker of differentiation. Melanin granules appear in stage 5 hair follicles coincident with tyrosinase expression in nonproliferating tyrosinase-related protein-2+/tyrosinase-related protein-1+ melanocytes. Stage 6-8 hair follicles, those actively producing hair, show nonproliferating tyrosinase-related protein-2+ melanocytes in the bulge area, tyrosinase-related protein-2+/tyrosinase-related protein-1+ melanocytes in the outer root sheath, and tyrosinase-related protein-2+/tyrosinase-related protein-1+/tyrosinase+ melanocytes above the dermal papilla. These data suggest that melanocyte precursor cells proliferate extensively at the onset of follicle development. Progeny of these cells migrate down the developing follicle, differentiating further until reaching the area immediately above the dermal papilla, where fully differentiated nonproliferative melanin-producing melanocytes persist, contributing pigment to the growing hair shaft.",Follicle development,tyrosinase-related protein-1

The pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and adrenocorticotropic hormone, are important mediators of human skin pigmentation via action at the melanocortin-1 receptor. Recent data suggests that such a regulatory role also exists for the endogenous opiate, beta-endorphin (beta-END). A role for this beta-END in the regulation of follicular pigmentation, however, has not been determined. This study was designed to examine the involvement of the beta-END/mu-opiate receptor system in human follicular melanocyte biology. We employed RT-PCR, and immunohisto/cytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy using beta-END and mu-opiate receptor specific antibodies and a functional role for beta-END was assessed by direct stimulation with the peptide. This study has demonstrated that human hair follicle melanocytes (HFM) express mRNA for the mu-opiate receptor and POMC. Furthermore, beta-END and its high affinity mu-opiate receptor are expressed at the protein level in glycoprotein100-positive follicular melanocytes and as a function of their anatomic location and differentiation status during the hair growth cycle. Functional studies revealed that beta-END is a modifier of HFM phenotype via its ability to upregulate melanogenesis, dendricity, and proliferation. These findings suggest a new regulatory role for beta-END in human HFM biology, providing a new research direction into the fundamental regulation of human hair pigmentation.",hair growth cycle,beta-Endorphin

BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein (HSP) is a molecular chaperone involved in protein folding, assembly, and transport and in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. HSP27 protein is expressed in murine hair follicle (HF) and in human skin during fetal development. In this investigation we hypothesized that HSP27 protein is expressed in the human scalp skin and its expression in HF changes with the transitions form anagen --> catagen --> telogen stages. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, the immunoreactivity of HSP27 protein was examined in human scalp skin by immunofluorescent method. A total of 50 normal human scalp skin biopsy specimens were examined (healthy women, age 53-57 years). In each case, 50 HF were analyzed (35, 10, and 5 follicles in anagen, catagen, and telogen, respectively). RESULTS: HSP27 protein expression was prominent in human scalp anagen, and weak in both catagen and telogen HFs. Within HF, HSP27 protein immunoreactivity was prominent in the outer root sheath, inner root sheath, precorteocytes, and corteocytes of the hair shaft. In addition, HSP27 protein expression was prominent in the epidermis, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and arrector pili muscles. LIMITATIONS: Only some types of heat shock proteins are known to date. Also, our knowledge about the exact molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions among these protein and other molecular chaperones is still incomplete.

BACKGROUND: beta-Catenin, the transducer of Wnt signaling, is critical for the development and growth of hair follicles. In the absence of Wnt signals, cytoplasmic beta-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 and then degraded. Therefore, inhibition of GSK-3 may enhance hair growth via beta-catenin stabilization. Valproic acid is an anticonvulsant and a mood-stabilizing drug that has been used for decades. Recently, valproic acid was reported to inhibit GSK-3beta in neuronal cells, but its effect on human hair follicles remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of VPA on human hair growth. METHODS: We investigated the effect of VPA on cultured human dermal papilla cells and outer root sheath cells and on an in vitro culture of human hair follicles, which were obtained from scalp skin samples of healthy volunteers. Anagen induction by valproic acid was evaluated using C57BL/6 mice model. RESULTS: Valproic acid not only enhanced the viability of human dermal papilla cells and outer root sheath cells but also promoted elongation of the hair shaft and reduced catagen transition of human hair follicles in organ culture model. Valproic acid treatment of human dermal papilla cells led to increased beta-catenin levels and nuclear accumulation and inhibition of GSK-3beta by phosphorylation.

It is clear that the dermal papilla cell (DPC), which is located at the bottom of the hair follicle, is a special mesenchymal component, and it plays a leading role in regulating hair follicle development and periodic regeneration. Recent studies showed that the Wnt signaling pathway through beta-catenin (canonical Wnt signaling pathway) is an essential component in maintaining the hair-inducing activity of the dermal papilla and growth of hair papilla cells. However, the intrinsic pathways and regulating mechanism are largely unknown. In the previous work, we constructed a cDNA subtractive library of DPC and first found that the TCF4 gene, as a key factor of Wnt signaling pathway, was expressed as the upregulated gene of the hair follicle in low-passage DPC. This study was to explore the role of TCF4 in regulating the proliferation and secretory activity of DPC. We constructed a pcDNA3.0-TCF4 expression vector and transfected it into DPC to achieve stable expression by bangosome 2000. Furthermore, we used the method of chemosynthesis to synthesize three pairs of TCF4 siRNA and transfected them into DPC. Meanwhile, we compared the transfection group and non-transfection group.

In addition, VDR-/- mice exhibit impaired cutaneous wound healing. We undertook experiments to determine whether the stress-inducible regulator of energy homeostasis, DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (Ddit4), is involved in these processes. By analyzing hair cycle activation in vivo, we show that VDR-/- mice at day 14 exhibit increased Ddit4 expression within follicular stress compartments. At day 29, degenerating VDR-/- follicular keratinocytes, but not bulge stem cells, continue to exhibit an increase in Ddit4 expression. At day 47, when normal follicles and epidermis are quiescent and enriched for Ddit4, VDR-/- skin lacks Ddit4 expression. In a skin wound healing assay, the re-epithelialized epidermis in wildtype (WT) but not VDR-/- animals harbor a population of Ddit4- and Krt10-positive cells.

Genotoxicity-induced hair loss from chemotherapy and radiotherapy is often encountered in cancer treatment, and there is a lack of effective treatment. In growing hair follicles (HF), quiescent stem cells (SC) are maintained in the bulge region, and hair bulbs at the base contain rapidly dividing, yet genotoxicity-sensitive transit-amplifying cells (TAC) that maintain hair growth. How genotoxicity-induced HF injury is repaired remains unclear. We report here that HFs mobilize ectopic progenitors from distinct TAC compartments for regeneration in adaptation to the severity of dystrophy induced by ionizing radiation (IR). Specifically, after low-dose IR, keratin 5+ basal hair bulb progenitors, rather than bulge SCs, were quickly activated to replenish matrix cells and regenerated all concentric layers of HFs, demonstrating their plasticity. After high-dose IR, when both matrix and hair bulb cells were depleted, the surviving outer root sheath cells rapidly acquired an SC-like state and fueled HF regeneration. Their progeny then homed back to SC niche and supported new cycles of HF growth. We also revealed that IR induced HF dystrophy and hair loss and suppressed WNT signaling in a p53- and dose-dependent manner. Augmenting WNT signaling attenuated the suppressive effect of p53 and enhanced ectopic progenitor proliferation after genotoxic injury, thereby preventing both IR- and cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia. Hence, targeted activation of TAC-derived progenitor cells, rather than quiescent bulge SCs, for anagen HF repair can be a potential approach to prevent hair loss from chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

610,30143655,12737,F000003,1,"Tight Junction barriers in human hair follicles - role of claudin-1. Barrier function of hair follicles (HFs) is of great interest because they might be an entry port for allergens/pathogens, but could on the other hand be used for drug delivery or vaccination. Therefore we investigated tight junction (TJ) barrier function in human HFs. We show that there is a TJ barrier in the outermost living layer bordering to the environment from the infundibulum to the lower central part and between Henle's and Huxles layer of anagen HFs. In club hair typical for catagen and telogen HFs a TJ barrier is found surrounding the club. This demonstrates that there is a continuous TJ barrier along interfollicular epidermis and HFs in different phases of HF cycle. However, interestingly, in cell culture experiments we can show that barrier is less tight in HF keratinocytes compared to interfollicular keratinocytes. Knock-down of the TJ protein claudin-1, which we demonstrate here to be less expressed in HFs of lesional atopic dermatitis skin, results in impaired barrier function, decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of hair keratinocytes. This is in line with a hair growth phenotype in claudin-1 deficient patients (NISCH syndrome) and corresponding knock-out mice and indicates an important role of claudin-1 in HF barrier function and growth.",hair growth,claudin-1

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a dimeric glycoprotein that induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells as well as regulation of capillary formation around hair follicles which affects the growth and development of hair follicles. cgVEGF164 is a major splice variant of the cashmere goat VEGF-A gene, but its regulation on hair follicles is rarely known. In order to investigate the role of cgVEGF164 on the growth of murine hair follicles, we produced keratin 14 promoter-driven cgVEGF164 transgenic mice via pronuclear microinjection. Firstly, the diameter and density of hair follicles of transgenic mice were compared with non-transgenic control mice in paraffin sections stained by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E). Then, protein expression levels and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, AKT1 and LEF1 were examined by Western blot. There are five positive individuals among the neonatal mice (positive rate is 8.5%). Compared with non-transgenic control mice, the diameter and density of hair follicles in transgenic mice are both obviously increased. The expression levels of P-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, P-AKT1/AKT1 and P-LEF1/LEF1 are significantly higher in transgenic mice than those in non-transgenic control mice. Based on these results, we conclude that cgVEGF164 as a growth factor can improve the growth of hair follicles which might be mediated by increasing the levels of ERK1/2, AKT1, and LEF1 protein phosphorylation.",the growth and development of hair Follicles,Vascular endothelial growth factor

(Asteraceae) (EP) has been widely used for the treatment of skin disease in Asian traditional medicine. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the potency of EP in promoting hair growth in vivo and in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57BL/6N mice were divided into four groups (n = 4) as follows: control (topical treatment of normal saline), topical 3% minoxidil to the dorsal skin of mice for 14 days, and low (1 mg/day) and high (10 mg/day) doses of EP orally administered once a day for 14 days. Dorsal hairs of C57BL/6N mice were depilated to synchronize anagen induction. Hair growth activity was evaluated by gross and microscopic observations. Sections of dorsal skin were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. We also treated the various concentrations of EP (5, 10 and 50 mug/mL) for 24 h on the human dermal papilla cells (HDPs) and examined the effects of EP on the expression of FGF-7 and mTOR signalling. RESULTS: EP enhanced the induction of anagen in the dorsal skin of mice, characterized by the appearance of inner root sheath along with hair shaft, the emergence of hair shaft through the epidermis. EP increased the expression of FGF-7, while decreased the level of FGF-5 in C57/BL6 mice. EP also increased the expression of FGF-7, activated the mTOR signalling in HDPs. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that EP has a potency to enhance the growth of hair follicle, promoting hair growth through regulation of FGF-7 and FGF-5.",dermal papilla cells,FGF-7

BACKGROUND: Human hair is highly responsive to stress, and human scalp hair follicles (HFs) contain a peripheral neuroendocrine equivalent of the systemic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis. Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is supposed to be aggravated by stress. We used corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which triggers the HPA axis, to induce a stress response in human ex vivo male AGA HFs. Caffeine is known to reverse testosterone-mediated hair growth inhibition in the same hair organ culture model. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether caffeine would antagonize CRH-mediated stress in these HFs. METHODS: HFs from balding vertex area scalp biopsies of men affected by AGA were incubated with CRH (10-7 mol L-1 ) with or without caffeine (0 001% or 0 005%). RESULTS: Compared to controls, CRH significantly enhanced the expression of catagen-inducing transforming growth factor-beta2 (TGF-beta2) (P < 0 001), CRH receptors 1 and 2 (CRH-R1/2) (P < 0 01), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (P < 0 001) and melanocortin receptor 2 (MC-R2) (P < 0 001), and additional stress-associated parameters, substance P and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR ).

Previous studies have shown the distribution of ESGs and HFs in volar hindfeet of C57BL/6 mice, but there are few or no reports on the distribution of ESGs and HFs in volar forefeet of C57BL/6 mice and volar feet of SD rats. Here, we investigated the differential distribution and genetic determination of ESGs and HFs in the volar skin of C57BL/6 mice and SD rats through gross observation, iodine-starch sweat test, double staining with Nile Blue A and Oil Red O, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, double immunofluorescence staining of LIM Homeobox 2 (LHX2)/Na+-K+-ATPase alpha1(NKA) or LHX2/Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), and qRT-PCR detection of ESG-related gene Engrailed 1 (En1) and HF-related gene LHX2.

METHODS: We evaluated cell proliferations in cultured DPCs by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and measured the expressions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt, Bcl-2, and Bax by Western blot. We also measured elongation of hair follicles in organ culture. RESULTS: Minoxidil significantly increased the proliferation of DPCs. The levels of ERK phosphorylation and of phosphorylated Akt increased significantly 1 h post-treatment; percentage increase of ERK phosphorylation was 287% at 0.1 microM and 351% at 1.0 microM of minoxidil, and that of Akt phosphorylation was 168% at 0.1 microM and 257% at 1.0 microM of minoxidil. 1.0 microM of minoxidil increased Bcl-2 expression over 150%, while 1.0 microM of minoxidil decreased Bax expression by more than 50%.

Dermal papilla (DP) at the hair follicle base is important for hair growth. Recent studies demonstrated that mouse vibrissa DP cells can be cultured in the presence of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), but lose expression of versican and their follicle-inducing activity during the culture, and that activation of the Wnt signal, which is inhibited by glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), in the DP cells promotes hair growth activity. We therefore investigated the influence of a GSK-3 inhibitor, (2'Z,3'E)-6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO), on the growth of human DP cells and mouse vibrissa follicles in culture. We first demonstrated that, similarly to mouse DP cells, human DP cells were able to be cultured up to 15 passages in the presence of FGF-2, and lost the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). When human DP cells later than ten passages were treated with BIO, the expression of ALP as well as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), another DP marker, was significantly elevated. Nuclear and perinuclear translocation of beta-catenin was also observed. We then cultured mouse vibrissa follicles. In the presence of BIO, the follicles could be maintained for at least 3 days without detectable regression of the hair bulbs. The morphology and ALP expression were well preserved. BIO successfully retrieved the expression of DP marker molecules, such as ALP and IGF-1 in cultured human DP cells, and maintained mouse hair bulbs. Thus, treatment with BIO may be useful to prepare DP cells with hair follicle-inducing activity.",hair Follicle,beta-catenin

Despite significant progress in hair structure and hair shape determination using animal models, the mechanisms controlling the architecture and the shape of the human hair remain largely unexplored. In this study, comparison of the genetic expression of several human genes, especially those involved in growth, development, and differentiation, between Caucasian curly hair and naturally straight hair was performed. Thereafter, analyses using human recombinant and lentiviral vector technologies were conducted to further dissect and elucidate a molecular mechanism that regulates hair growth and development, particularly in controlling the shape of the hair shaft. Overexpression of IGF-binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5) in the human hair xenografts obtained from straight- and curly-haired individuals was found to result in the decreased expression of several extracellular matrix proteins and disassembly of adhesional junctions, resulting in twisted hair shafts as well as an unusual deposition of hair cuticle that may be derived from the disturbance of normal proliferation and differentiation. This study provides evidence that IGFBP-5 has an effect on human hair shape, and that lentiviral transduction regimen can be used for functional analysis of genes involved in human hair morphogenesis.",hair Follicle,IGF-binding protein 5
627,22696062,2932,F000001,1,"P-cadherin regulates human hair growth and cycling via canonical Wnt signaling and transforming growth factor-beta2. P-cadherin is a key component of epithelial adherens junctions, and it is prominently expressed in the hair follicle (HF) matrix. Loss-of-function mutations in CDH3, which encodes P-cadherin, result in hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy (HJMD), an autosomal recessive disorder featuring sparse and short hair. Here, we attempted to recapitulate some aspects of HJMD in vitro by transfecting normal, organ-cultured human scalp HFs with lipofectamine and CDH3-specific or scrambled control siRNAs. As in HJMD patients, P-cadherin silencing inhibited hair shaft growth, prematurely induced HF regression (catagen), and inhibited hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation. In situ, membrane beta-catenin expression and transcription of the beta-catenin target gene, axin2, were significantly reduced, whereas glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta) and phospho-beta-catenin immunoreactivity were increased. These effects were partially reversed by inhibiting GSK3beta. P-cadherin silencing reduced the expression of the anagen-promoting growth factor, IGF-1, whereas that of transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFbeta2; catagen promoter) was enhanced. Neutralizing TGFbeta antagonized the catagen-promoting effects of P-cadherin silencing. In summary, we introduce human HFs as an attractive preclinical model for studying the functions of P-cadherin in human epithelial biology and pathology. This model demonstrates that cadherins can be successfully knocked down in an intact human organ in vitro, and shows that P-cadherin is needed for anagen maintenance by regulating canonical Wnt signaling and suppressing TGFbeta2.",hair Follicle,glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta

The functional limitation of expanded adult DPCs has been a difficult challenge for cell-based hair regrowth therapy.

631,23389444,16590,F000013,1,"NFIB is a governor of epithelial-melanocyte stem cell behaviour in a shared niche. Adult stem cells reside in specialized niches where they receive environmental cues to maintain tissue homeostasis. In mammals, the stem cell niche within hair follicles is home to epithelial hair follicle stem cells and melanocyte stem cells, which sustain cyclical bouts of hair regeneration and pigmentation. To generate pigmented hairs, synchrony is achieved such that upon initiation of a new hair cycle, stem cells of each type activate lineage commitment. Dissecting the inter-stem-cell crosstalk governing this intricate coordination has been difficult, because mutations affecting one lineage often affect the other. Here we identify transcription factor NFIB as an unanticipated coordinator of stem cell behaviour. Hair follicle stem-cell-specific conditional targeting of Nfib in mice uncouples stem cell synchrony. Remarkably, this happens not by perturbing hair cycle and follicle architecture, but rather by promoting melanocyte stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The early production of melanin is restricted to melanocyte stem cells at the niche base. Melanocyte stem cells more distant from the dermal papilla are unscathed, thereby preventing hair greying typical of melanocyte stem cell differentiation mutants. Furthermore, we pinpoint KIT-ligand as a dermal papilla signal promoting melanocyte stem cell differentiation. Additionally, through chromatin-immunoprecipitation with high-throughput-sequencing and transcriptional profiling, we identify endothelin 2 (Edn2) as an NFIB target aberrantly activated in NFIB-deficient hair follicle stem cells. Ectopically induced Edn2 recapitulates NFIB-deficient phenotypes in wild-type mice. Conversely, endothelin receptor antagonists and/or KIT blocking antibodies prevent precocious melanocyte stem cell differentiation in the NFIB-deficient niche. Our findings reveal how melanocyte and hair follicle stem cell behaviours maintain reliance upon cooperative factors within the niche, and how this can be uncoupled in injury, stress and disease states.",hair cycle,KIT

The histological features of the follicles of newborn Hu-lambs were combined with fluorescence quantitative PCR technology to detect the correlation between the expression of the seven genes and hair follicle development. Among the genes studied, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7), and sideroflexin 1 (SFXN1) showed a significantly different pattern of expression in large, medium, and small wave follicles (P < 0.05). The expression of MMP2 had a significant positive correlation with secondary follicles in large waves (P < 0.05), while the expression of BMP7 had a significant correlation with primary follicle diameter in small wave follicles, and a highly significant positive correlation with the number of secondary follicles in the small waves (P < 0.01). The expression of SFXN1 was significantly and positively correlated with the diameters of small wave primary follicles; it also showed a highly significant positive correlation with secondary follicle diameters.

Hair growth disorders often carry a major psychological burden. Therefore, more effective human hair growth-modulatory agents urgently need to be developed. Here, we used the hypertrichosis-inducing immunosuppressant, Cyclosporine A (CsA), as a lead compound to identify new hair growth-promoting molecular targets. Through microarray analysis we identified the Wnt inhibitor, secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1), as being down-regulated in the dermal papilla (DP) of CsA-treated human scalp hair follicles (HFs) ex vivo. Therefore, we further investigated the function of SFRP1 using a pharmacological approach and found that SFRP1 regulates intrafollicular canonical Wnt/beta-catenin activity through inhibition of Wnt ligands in the human hair bulb. Conversely, inhibiting SFRP1 activity through the SFRP1 antagonist, WAY-316606, enhanced hair shaft production, hair shaft keratin expression, and inhibited spontaneous HF regression (catagen) ex vivo. Collectively, these data (a) identify Wnt signalling as a novel, non-immune-inhibitory CsA target; (b) introduce SFRP1 as a physiologically important regulator of canonical beta-catenin activity in a human (mini-)organ; and (c) demonstrate WAY-316606 to be a promising new promoter of human hair growth.

Whilst topical steroids represent one of the most frequently administered treatments for skin and hair diseases, predominantly based on their glucocorticoid receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory effects, the mineralocorticoid effects of topical steroids have received surprisingly little attention. However, the role of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling is now known to extend beyond the kidney, with human skin, including the hair follicle (HF), expressing the MR. Using microdissected female HFs treated ex vivo with MR agonists and antagonists, we sought to determine the effects of MR-mediated signaling in the cutaneous context. Indeed, not only did the skin and HF epithelium express the MR at both the gene and protein level, but its expression was hair cycle dependent. Moreover, the selective MR antagonist eplerenone promoted hair shaft elongation and hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation whilst delaying catagen (HF regression). These novel observations suggest that the female human HF is sensitive to the inhibition of MR signaling and provide the first evidence that sustained MR signaling may even be required to maintain the growth phase (anagen) of human scalp HFs.

BACKGROUND: During goat embryonic morphogenesis and postnatal initiation of hair follicle (HF) regeneration, dermal papilla (DP) cells play a vital role in hair formation. Growing evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in HF development and DP cell proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. RESULT: In this study, we utilized miRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq) to identify differentially expressed miRNAs at different HF cycling stages (anagen and telogen). MiRNA-Seq has identified 411 annotated miRNAs and 130 novel miRNAs in which 29 miRNAs were up-regulated and 32 miRNAs were down-regulated in the anagen phase compared to the telogen phase. Target gene prediction and functional enrichment analysis indicated some major biological pathways related to hair cycling, such as Wnt signaling pathways, ECM-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling pathway, biosynthesis of amino acids, metabolic pathways, ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation. Also, we explored the function of chi-miR-30b-5p in regulating hair growth cycle. Similar to the HF cycling, DP cells were isolated from skin and used to investigate miRNA functions. The MTT and EdU assays showed that the viability and proliferation of DP cells were inhibited or promoted after the transfection of chi-miR-30b-5p mimic or inhibitor, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed CaMKIIdelta as a candidate target gene of chi-miR-30b-5p, and the dual-luciferase and western blot assay demonstrated that chi-miR-30b-5p bound to the 3'UTR of CaMKIIdelta and further inhibited its translation.

Materials and Methods: In this study, mouse vibrissae follicles were dissected on day 10 after depilation. Then, the bulb and bulge cells of the hair follicle were treated with minoxidil and azelaic acid for 10 days to evaluate Sonic hedgehog (Shh) protein expression. Moreover, bulge and bulb cells of the hair follicles were cultivated and the expression of Gli1, Gli2, and Axin2 mRNA levels was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. We further investigated the protective effects of azelaic acid against ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation in cultured bulb and bulge cells by determining catalase activity. An irradiation dose of 20 mJ/cm2 UVB for 4 sec was chosen. Results: The results showed that catalase activity significantly (p<0.05) increased in the bulge cells after exposure to 2.5 mM and 25 mM azelaic acid. Meanwhile, treatment of the bulb cells with azelaic acid (2.5 and 25 mM) did not cause significant changes in catalase activity. We also found that azelaic acid (25 mM) alone upregulated Gli1 and Gli2 expression in the bulge cells and 100 micro minoxidil caused Gli1 and Axin2 overexpression in the bulb region of the hair follicle. Moreover, minoxidil (100 microM) alone and in combination with azelaic acid (25 mM) led to Shh protein overexpression in the hair follicles in vitro and in organ culture. Conclusion: Our results indicated a potential role for azelaic acid in the protection of bulge cells from UVB damage and its combination with minoxidil may activate hair growth through overexpression of Shh protein.",hair Follicle,Gli1

Three distinct patterns of hair follicle c-Myc immunoreactivity were observed. In the infundibulum, c-Myc staining was predominantly in the basal layers, with little detectable immunoreactivity in the terminally differentiating suprabasal layers; this pattern was similar to that seen in the epidermis. In contrast, c-Myc expression in the follicle bulb was found both in the proliferating germinative epithelial cells and in the terminally differentiating matrix cells that give rise to the hair fiber. Finally, intense c-Myc immunoreactivity was detected in the bulge region of the outer root sheath. Using the C8/144B antibody as a bulge marker, we confirmed that c-Myc immunoreactivity in the outer root sheath correlates with the putative hair follicle stem cell compartment. c-Myc expression in the bulge was independent of the hair growth cycle stage. Our data suggest that Myc superfamily members serve different functions in separate epithelial compartments of the hair follicle and may play an important role in determining cell fate within the putative stem cell compartment.",hair Follicle,N-Myc
648,12533516,12443,F000001,1,"Sonic hedgehog-dependent activation of Gli2 is essential for embryonic hair follicle development. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays a critical role in hair follicle development and skin cancer, but how it controls these processes remains unclear. Of the three Gli transcription factors involved in transducing Shh signals in vertebrates, we demonstrate here that Gli2 is the key mediator of Shh responses in skin. Similar to Shh(-/-) mice, Gli2(-/-) mutants exhibit an arrest in hair follicle development with reduced cell proliferation and Shh-responsive gene expression, but grossly normal epidermal differentiation. By transgenic rescue experiments, we show that epidermal Gli2 function alone is sufficient to restore hair follicle development in Gli2(-/-) skin. Furthermore, only a constitutively active form of Gli2, but not wild-type Gli2, can activate Shh-responsive gene expression and promote cell proliferation in Shh(-/-) skin. These observations indicate that Shh-dependent Gli2 activator function in the epidermis is essential for hair follicle development. Our data also reveal that Gli2 mediates the mitogenic effects of Shh by transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 in the developing hair follicles. Together, our results suggest that Shh-dependent Gli2 activation plays a critical role in epithelial homeostasis by promoting proliferation through the transcriptional control of cell cycle regulators.",hair Follicles,cyclin D1

In this study we report on the cloning of two novel human type II keratin cDNAs, K6irs3 and K6irs4, which were specifically expressed in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle. Together with the genes of two previously described type II inner root sheath keratins, K6irs1 and K6irs2, the K6irs3 and K6irs4 genes were subclustered in the type II keratin/hair keratin gene domain on chromosome 12q13. Evolutionary tree analysis using all known type II epithelial and hair keratins revealed that the K6irs1-4 formed a branch separate from the other epithelial and hair keratins. RNA in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence studies of human hair follicles, which also included the K6irs2 keratin, demonstrated that both K6irs2 and K6irs3 were specifically expressed in the inner root sheath cuticle, but showed a different onset of expression in this compartment. Whereas the K6irs3 expression began in the lowermost bulb region, that of K6irs2 was delayed up to the height of the apex of the dermal papilla. In contrast, the K6irs4 keratin was specifically expressed in the Huxley layer. Moreover, K6irs4 was ideally suited to further investigate the occurrence of Flugelzellen, i.e., Huxley cells, characterized by horizontal cell extensions that pass through the Henle layer, abut upon the companion layer, and form desmosomal connections with the surrounding cells. Previously, we detected Flugelzellen only in the region along the differentiated Henle layer. Using the Huxley-cell-specific K6irs4 antiserum, we now demonstrate this cell type to be clearly apposed to the entire Henle layer. We provide evidence that Flugelzellen penetrate the Henle layer actively and may play a role in conferring plasticity and resilience to the otherwise rigid upper Henle layer.",hair Follicle,K6irs3
650,14597196,3098,F000021,1,"Overexpression of Sonic Hedgehog suppresses embryonic hair follicle morphogenesis. The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signalling pathway plays a central role in the development of the skin and hair follicle and is a major determinant of skin tumorigenesis, most notably of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Various mouse models involving either ablation or overexpression of key members of the Shh signalling pathway display a range of skin tumours. To further examine the role of Shh in skin development, we have overexpressed Shh in a subset of interfollicular basal cells from 12.5 dpc under the control of the human keratin 1 (HK1) promoter. The HK1-Shh transgenic mice display a range of skin anomalies, including highly pigmented inguinal lesions and regions of alopecia. The most striking hair follicle phenotype is a suppression in embryonic follicle development between 14.0 and 19.0 dpc, resulting in a complete absence of guard, awl, and auchene hair fibres. These data indicate that alternative signals are responsible for the development of different hair follicles and point to a major role of Shh signalling in the morphogenesis of guard, awl, and auchene hair fibres. Through a comparison with other mouse models, the characteristics of the HK1-Shh transgenic mice suggest that the precise timing and site of Shh expression are key in dictating the resultant skin and tumour phenotype.",hair Follicle morphogenesis,HK1

This review summarizes the current nomenclature and evolutional aspects of S100 Ca(2+)-binding proteins and S100 fused-type proteins (SFTPs) classified as a separate protein family with special reference to the molecular structure and function of S100A3 dominantly expressed in hair cuticular cells. Both S100 and SFTP family members are identified by two distinct types of Ca(2+)-binding loops in an N-terminal pseudo EF-hand motif followed by a canonical EF-hand motif. Seventeen members of the S100 protein family including S100A3 are clustered with seven related genes encoding SFTPs on human chromosome 1q21, implicating their association with epidermal maturation and diseases. Human S100A3 is characterized by two disulphide bridges and a preformed Zn(2+)-pocket, and may transfer Ca(2+) ions to peptidylarginine deiminases after its citrullination-mediated tetramerization. Phylogenetic analysis utilizing current genome databases suggests that divergence of the S100A3 gene coincided with the emergence of hair, a defining feature of mammals, and that the involvement of S100A3 in epithelial Ca(2+)-cycling occurred as a result of a skin adaptation in terrestrial mammals.",hair Follicles,S100A3

Woolly hair (WH) is an abnormal variant of tightly curled hair, which is frequently associated with hypotrichosis. Non-syndromic forms of WH can show either autosomal-dominant WH (ADWH) or autosomal-recessive WH (ARWH) inheritance patterns. ARWH has recently been shown to be caused by mutations in either the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (LPAR6) or lipase H (LIPH) gene. More recently, a mutation in the keratin K74 (KRT74) gene has been reported to underlie ADWH. Importantly, all of these genes are abundantly expressed in the inner root sheath (IRS) of human hair follicles.

Our purpose is to clarify the physiological role of leptin in hair cycle as leptin reportedly causes activation of Stat3, which is indispensable for hair cycling. While hair follicles in dorsal skin of 5-week-old C57/BL6 mice had progressed to late anagen phase, those in dorsal skin of 5-week-old leptin receptor deficient db/db mice remained in the first telogen and later entered the anagen at postnatal day 40, indicating that deficiency in leptin receptor signalling delayed the second hair cycle progression. Next, we shaved dorsal hairs on wild-type mice at postnatal 7 weeks and injected skin with mouse leptin or a mock. After 20 days, although mock injection showed no effect, hair growth occurred around leptin injection area. Human leptin fragment (aa22-56) had similar effects. Although the hair cycle of ob/ob mice was similar to that of wild-type mice, injection of mouse leptin on ob/ob mice at postnatal 7 weeks induced anagen transition. Immunohistochemically, leptin is expressed in hair follicles from catagen to early anagen in wild-type mice, suggesting that leptin is an anagen inducer in vivo.

BACKGROUND: Arachidonic acid (AA) is an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid present in all mammalian cell membranes, and involved in the regulation of many cellular processes, including cell survival, angiogenesis, and mitogenesis. The dermal papilla, composed of specialized fibroblasts located in the bulb of the hair follicle, contributes to the control of hair growth and the hair cycle. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of AA on hair growth by using in vivo and in vitro models. METHODS: The effect of AA on human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and hair shaft elongation was evaluated by MTT assay and hair follicle organ culture, respectively. The expression of various growth and survival factors in hDPCs were investigated by western blot or immunohistochemistry. The ability of AA to induce and prolong anagen phase in C57BL/6 mice was analyzed. RESULTS: AA was found to enhance the viability of hDPCs and promote the expression of several factors responsible for hair growth, including fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7) and FGF-10. Western blotting identified the role of AA in the phosphorylation of various transcription factors (ERK, CREB, and AKT) and increased expression of Bcl-2 in hDPCs. In addition, AA significantly promoted hair shaft elongation, with increased proliferation of matrix keratinocytes, during ex vivo hair follicle culture.

Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is the dominant member of the SCD-isozyme family, regarded as a major regulator of lipid and energy metabolism in liver and adipose tissue. SCD1 deficiency impairs the desaturation of de novo-synthesized palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoA to palmitoleoyl- and oleoyl-CoA. Scd1-/- mice develop metabolic waste syndrome and skin lesions: epidermal barrier disruption, alopecia, and degeneration of sebaceous glands. The unifying molecular link between the two divergent traits remains incompletely understood. Here we show the absence of palmitoleic acid (9Z-16:1) in the lipidome of the scd1-null mouse, which prohibits posttranslational O-palmitoleoylation of Wnt3a protein, essential for Wnt3a/ss-catenin signaling in stem cell lineage decision in development of the epidermal barrier, hair growth cycle, and sebaceous glands. Substitution of the disrupted epidermal lipid barrier by an inert hydrocarbon coat prevents excessive transepidermal water loss, normalizes thermogenesis and metabolic parameters, and surprisingly leads to the activation of hair bulge progenitor cells and reprograming of a regular hair growth cycle and development of a regular fur in scd1-/- mice. Progenitor sebocytes are not activated.

There is an unmet need for novel, non-pharmacological therapeutics to treat alopecia. Recent studies have shown the potential biological benefits of non-thermal atmospheric pressure plasma (NTAPP), including wound healing, angiogenesis, and the proliferation of stem cells. We hypothesized that NTAPP might have a stimulatory effect on hair growth or regeneration. We designed an NTAPP-generating apparatus which is applicable to in vitro and in vivo experiments. The human dermal papilla (DP) cells, isolated fresh hair follicles, and mouse back skin were exposed with the NTAPP. Biological outcomes were measured using RNA-sequencing, RT-PCR, Western blots, and immunostaining. The NTAPP treatment increased the expression levels of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway-related genes (AMER3, CCND1, LEF1, and LRG1) and proteins (beta-catenin, p-GSK3beta, and cyclin D1) in human DP cells. In contrast, inhibitors of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, endo-IWR1 and IWP2, attenuated the levels of cyclin D1, p-GSK3beta, and beta-catenin proteins induced by NTAPP. Furthermore, we observed that NTAPP induced the activation of beta-catenin in DP cells of hair follicles and the mRNA levels of target genes of the beta-catenin signaling pathway (CCND1, LEF1, and TCF4). NTAPP-treated mice exhibited markedly increased anagen induction, hair growth, and the protein levels of beta-catenin, p-GSK3beta, p-AKT, and cyclin D1. NTAPP stimulates hair growth via activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in DP cells.

Hair loss is a chronic disorder that affects many people; however, a complete treatment has not yet been developed. Therefore, new therapeutic agents for preventing hair loss must be developed, and electromagnetic field (EMF) therapy has been proven to be a promising medical treatment in various fields, including hair loss treatment. This study evaluated the effect of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) intensity and exposure time by analyzing the expression of cytokines and anagen-related molecules, which influence hair activation and growth, in hair bulb spheroid (HBS) and hair follicle (HF) organ cultures. ELF-EMFs did not induce toxicity in the HBSs, as verified via the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Moreover, an ELF-EMF intensity of 5-20 G promoted the expression of ALP, versican, beta-catenin, and several cytokines (VEGF, PDGF, FGF-10, and ET-1) in HBSs. Immunohistochemical staining showed that ELF-EMF at an intensity of 5-20 G upregulated ALP and beta-catenin and decreased TUNEL staining in HBS. Moreover, HFs exposed to ELF-EMF for 60 min exhibited an increase in hair length and a 1.5-fold increase in IL-4, ICAM-1, ALP, and versican mRNA expression compared to the control. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that 60 min of ELF-EMF can increase the expression of ALP and beta-catenin and decreases TUNEL staining in organ cultures. Collectively, our results demonstrated that ELF-EMF exposure at a 10 G intensity for 60 min promoted hair shaft growth in HFs due to the effect of cytokines and adhesion molecules via the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Therefore, ELF-EMF is a promising treatment for hair loss.",hair shaft growth,beta-Catenin
